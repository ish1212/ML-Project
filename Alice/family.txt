ill never stop dreaming that one day we can be a real family together all of us laughing and talking loving and understanding not looking at the past but only to the future if a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds i strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference they are the father the mother and the teacher family means no one gets left behind or forgotten the love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege sister is probably the most competitive relationship within the family but once the sisters are grown it becomes the strongest relationship family is not an important thing its everything family is the most important thing in the world a family can develop only with a loving woman as its center a happy family is but an earlier heaven a woman can take care of the family it takes a man to provide structure to provide stability a man should never neglect his family for business if you cannot get rid of the family skeleton you may as well make it dance the greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intendedand not to take a hint when a hint isnt intended he who is overly attached to his family members experiences fear and sorrow for the root of all grief is attachment thus one should discard attachment to be happy insanity runs in my family it practically gallops you dont choose your family they are gods gift to you as you are to them america cannot continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home people are pretty forgiving when it comes to other peoples families the only family that ever horrifies you is your own my family comes first maybe thats what makes me different from other guys if god can work through me he can work through anyone cherish your human connections  your relationships with friends and family spend some time this weekend on home improvement improve your attitude toward your family i come from that society and there is a common thread specifically family values  the idea that you do anything for your family and the unconditional love for ones children without a family man alone in the world trembles with the cold all of us grow up in particular realities  a home family a clan a small town a neighborhood depending upon how were brought up we are either deeply aware of the particular reading of reality into which we are born or we are peripherally aware of it dad kept us out of school but school comes and goes family is forever to us family means putting your arms around each other and being there the family is one of natures masterpieces my family is my strength and my weakness i was born into the most remarkable and eccentric family i could possibly have hoped for rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof i woke up one morning thinking about wolves and realized that wolf packs function as families everyone has a role and if you act within the parameters of your role the whole pack succeeds and when that falls apart so does the pack a family is a place where principles are hammered and honed on the anvil of everyday living the only rock i know that stays steady the only institution i know that works is the family maybe there is no actual place called hell maybe hell is just having to listen to our grandparents breathe through their noses when theyre eating sandwiches if one is desperate for love i suggest looking at ones friends and family and see if love is all around if not get a new set of friends a new family the children have been a wonderful gift to me and im thankful to have once again seen our world through their eyes they restore my faith in the familys future when trouble comes its your family that supports you give a little love to a child and you get a great deal back little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between love and duty i think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life first and foremost comes my family and my life with brad we have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that ones family is the most important thing in life i look at it this way one of these days ill be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me and the only people wholl be with me will be my family dignity is not negotiable dignity is the honor of the family my father used to play with my brother and me in the yard mother would come out and say youre tearing up the grass were not raising grass dad would reply were raising boys the family is the first essential cell of human society one of the things that binds us as a family is a shared sense of humor the family is the test of freedom because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself for me nothing has ever taken precedence over being a mother and having a family and a home when you have a godly husband a godly wife children who respect their parents and who are loved by their parents who provide for those children their physical and spiritual and material needs lovingly you have the ideal unit both within the family and without our sisters hold up our mirrors our images of who we are and of who we can dare to be in every conceivable manner the family is link to our past bridge to our future the family you come from isnt as important as the family youre going to have what must it be like for a little boy to read that daddy never loved mummy its very strange that most people dont care if their knowledge of their family history only goes back three generations ive given it my all ive done my best now im ready with my family to begin the next phase of our lives i am the baby in the family and i always will be i am actually very happy to have that position but i still get teased i dont mind that as a general thing when a woman wears the pants in a family she has a good right to them the family is the nucleus of civilization ive always put my family first and thats just the way it is i dont think anyone has a normal family i never did quite fit the glamour mode it is life with my husband and family that is my high now theres nothing i value more than the closeness of friends and family a smile as i pass someone on the street my kids give me the balance to live right there is no such thing as fun for the whole family tennis just a game family is forever i have frequently been questioned especially by women of how i could reconcile family life with a scientific career well it has not been easy i believe the world is one big family and we need to help each other when i was younger my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches my dad loves being around all kinds of animals hes the one who got me to be a really big animal lover i grew up in a big family with a lot of kids around and i definitely want to have children as well my life comes down to three moments the death of my father meeting my husband and the birth of my daughter everything i did previous to that just doesnt seem to add up to very much the attempt to redefine the family as a purely voluntary arrangement grows out of the modern delusion that people can keep all their options open all the time it is extraordinary that when you are acquainted with a whole family you can forget about them it takes a lot of work to put together a marriage to put together a family and a home family life itself that safest most traditional most approved of female choices is not a sanctuary it is perpetually a dangerous place a family is a risky venture because the greater the love the greater the loss thats the tradeoff but ill take it all you leave home to seek your fortune and when you get it you go home and share it with your family i mean i look at my dad he was twenty when he started having a family and he was always the coolest dad he did everything for his kids and he never made us feel like he was pressured i know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that i find the family the most mysterious and fascinating institution in the world pray in your family daily that yours may be in the number of the families who call upon god if we abandon marriage we abandon the family i am tortured when i am away from my family from my children i am horribly guiltridden the left dismisses talk about the collapse of family life and talks instead about the emergence of the growing new diversity of family types womens natural role is to be a pillar of the family some of the most important conversations ive ever had occurred at my familys dinner table its not that our family has no taste its just that our familys taste is inconsistent a woman should be home with the children building that home and making sure theres a secure family atmosphere i consider my mom and all my sisters my friends a woman can plan when to have her family and how to support a family im not much of a family man im just not that into it i love kids i adore them but i dont want to live my life for them my family is more important than my party i am the family face flesh perishes i live on i stay in tune with my family and god when im ready i plan to adopt i still believe in family i would rather start a family than finish one you have to defend your honor and your family happy is said to be the family which can eat onions together they are for the time being separate from the world and have a harmony of aspiration i have a family to support and im not always going to be doing exactly what i want to do parents need all the help they can get the strongest as well as the most fragile family requires a vital network of social supports when you start about family about lineage and ancestry you are talking about every person on earth i would love a family im at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger but who knows i have a lot of very close girlfriends and sisters  im from an all female family my father often quips that even the cat was neutered at a certain point im going to want to have a family i love my family for all of those willing to help me start a family i am flattered i will let you know when i need your help i realized my family was funny because nobody ever wanted to leave our house the one thing that kept our family together was the music the only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music my family was my guide to my reality well sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids but obviously we want a family so well have to start thinking about that i love children and i get along with them great its just that i believe if youre going to be a parent there has to be something inside you that says i want a family i dont feel that sense of urgency i love cooking for myself and cooking for my family also my mom and family are very important to me and i know that this is not expected i live quietly at home among my family and friends i dont know if i believe in marriage i believe in family love and children make a goal box a chart of positive daily contact with a family when you are working with them the most difficult is the first family to bring someone out of the world when i remember my family i always remember their backs they were always indignantly leaving places if i had no family my wife and i would lead a much more romantic and nomadic existence family nature and health all go together there are things that you cannot talk to your mother and father about there are things that you cannot talk to your children about once i got married and had kids i moved away from romantic roles because it seemed wrong to have my 3yearold wondering why daddy was kissing someone else i grew up in a very religious family i could read the quran easily at the age of five the foundation of family  thats where it all begins for me i grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed and debated intensely i have these visions of myself being thirty thirtyfive forty having a family my family background was deeply christian like all my family and class i considered it a sign of weakness to show affection to have been caught kissing my mother would have been a disgrace and to have shown affection for my father would have been a disaster the joke in our family is that we can cry reading the phone book we went to church every sunday when i was a kid the only time i sang was around my family our family life was certainly not intellectual we love to be with our family and friends and i can tell you that lots of eating will be involved my whole damn family was nice i dont think ive imagined it its true maybe it has to do with being brought up as christian scientists half of my relatives were readers or practitioners in the church god did not intend the human family to be wafted to heaven on flowery beds of ease to enjoy good health to bring true happiness to ones family to bring peace to all one must first discipline and control ones own mind if a man can control his mind he can find the way to enlightenment and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him as a child my familys menu consisted of two choices take it or leave it learn to enjoy every minute of your life be happy now dont wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future think how really precious is the time you have to spend whether its at work or with your family every minute should be enjoyed and savored in dwelling live close to the ground in thinking keep to the simple in conflict be fair and generous in governing dont try to control in work do what you enjoy in family life be completely present the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city its all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family every child should have a caring adult in their lives and thats not always a biological parent or family member it may be a friend or neighbor often times it is a teacher as the family goes so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated mistakes are tolerated communication is open and rules are flexible  the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family my family frankly they werent folks who went to church every week my mother was one of the most spiritual people i knew but she didnt raise me in the church so i came to my christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of jesus christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that i would want to lead it was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today the 40hour work week the minimum wage family leave health insurance social security medicare retirement plans the cornerstones of the middleclass security all bear the union label the great danger for family life in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure comfort and independence lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish fathers should be neither seen nor heard that is the only proper basis for family life actors are one family over the entire world he that raises a large family does indeed while he lives to observe them stand a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too any problem big or small within a family always seems to start with bad communication someone isnt listening when his life was ruined his family killed his farm destroyed job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens why god why me and the thundering voice of god answered theres just something about you that pisses me off never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people  your family friends and coworkers and even strangers you meet along the way the other night i ate at a real nice family restaurant every table had an argument going i can make a firm pledge under my plan no family making less than 250000 a year will see any form of tax increase not your income tax not your payroll tax not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes all men are children and of one family the same tale sends them all to bed and wakes them in the morning no matter what youve done for yourself or for humanity if you cant look back on having given love and attention to your own family what have you really accomplished its true christmas can feel like a lot of work particularly for mothers but when you look back on all the christmases in your life youll find youve created family traditions and lasting memories those memories good and bad are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success it enables you to ignore the minor hurts the opponents pressure and the temporary failures the details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private and i had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family so much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty all other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it i would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life a man who had good friends fine family  and i dont think i could ask for anything more than that actually positive feelings come from being honest about yourself and accepting your personality and physical characteristics warts and all and from belonging to a family that accepts you without question to maintain a joyful family requires much from both the parents and the children each member of the family has to become in a special way the servant of the others perhaps the greatest social service that can be rendered by anybody to the country and to mankind is to bring up a family my friends and family are my support system they tell me what i need to hear not what i want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times without them i have no idea where i would be and i know that their love for me is whats keeping my head above the water the firstborn in every family is always dreaming for an imaginary older brother or sister who will look out for them all the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers if every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family  and gods love  this world would be a far more gentle and better place but let me perfectly clear because i know youll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people if your family earns less than 250000 a year you will not see your taxes increased a single dime i repeat not one single dime if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands if i win and get the money then the oakland police department is going to buy a boys home me a house my family a house and a stop police brutality center on thanksgiving i will stop to give thanks that my family is safe and healthy especially because i realize that following the tragedies of this year it is all too real a possibility that they might not have been blood relatives often have nothing to do with family and similarly family is about who you choose to make your life with i am confident that nobody will accuse me of selfishness if i ask to spend time while i am still in good health with my family my friends and also with myself i looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it all happy families resemble one another each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way with all my fans i got a family again my restaurants are never opened on thanksgiving i want my staff to spend time with their family if they can my feeling is if i cant figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays then i dont deserve to be an owner the most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it i come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage in the richest country in the history of the world this obama economy has crushed the middle class family income has fallen by 4000 but health insurance premiums are higher food prices are higher utility bills are higher and gasoline prices have doubled today more americans wake up in poverty than ever before family is conflict and its something that we all relate to so live that you wouldnt be ashamed to sell the family parrot to the town gossip smartness runs in my family when i went to school i was so smart my teacher was in my class for five years we believed in our idea  a family park where parents and children could have fun together like religion politics and family planning cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public its too controversial friendship is held to be the severest test of character it is easy we think to be loyal to a family and clan whose blood is in your own veins marriage is an act of will that signifies and involves a mutual gift which unites the spouses and binds them to their eventual souls with whom they make up a sole family  a domestic church i have muslim members of my family i have lived in muslim countries i looked up my family tree and found out i was the sap as a single withered tree if set aflame causes a whole forest to burn so does a rascal son destroy a whole family i love my family very much i wish i could see them a little more often than i do but we understand because were a show business family and we all work this is all the inheritance i give to my dear family the religion of christ will give them one which will make them rich indeed my biggest hobby is hanging out with my family and kids i was angry and frustrated until i started my own family and my first child was born until then i didnt really appreciate life the way i should have but fortunately i woke up the most important thing in the world is family and love my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion her intelligence reflected in my daughters a man ought to live so that everybody knows he is a christian and most of all his family ought to know if you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account the american culture promotes personal responsibility the dignity of work the value of education the merit of service devotion to a purpose greater than self and at the foundation the preeminence of family now is the moment when we can stand up and say im an american i make my destiny and we deserve better my children deserve better my family deserves better my country deserves better so here we stand americans have a choice my dad had been born in mexico and his family had to leave during the mexican revolution the promise of america has always been that if you worked hard had the right values took some risks that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation president obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet my promise is to help you and your family when someone has cancer the whole family and everyone who loves them does too i love my family and i miss them very much but im a new person now i know a lot of people will not agree with what ive done but it was right for me i have now disposed of all my property to my family there is one thing more i wish i could give them and that is the christian religion knowledge is power information is liberating education is the premise of progress in every society in every family nobody has ever before asked the nuclear family to live all by itself in a box the way we do with no relatives no support weve put it in an impossible situation you cannot have maternal health without reproductive health and reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal safe abortion family quarrels are bitter things they dont go according to any rules theyre not like aches or wounds theyre more like splits in the skin that wont heal because theres not enough material all the men in my family were bearded and most of the women im just glad i was able to return to some of that innocence and beauty i had as a child when i started my own family and my children brought me back some of that spirit be strong believe in freedom and in god love yourself understand your sexuality have a sense of humor masturbate dont judge people by their religion color or sexual habits love life and your family if you ever start feeling like you have the goofiest craziest most dysfunctional family in the world all you have to do is go to a state fair because five minutes at the fair youll be going you know were alright we are dang near royalty the place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one particularly if he plays golf a family with the wrong members in control that perhaps is as near as one can come to describing england in a phrase cherish your human connections your relationships with friends and family all in the family was intellectual it was art where would you be without friends the people to pick you up when you need lifting we come from homes far from perfect so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends  your own chosen family theres nothing like a really loyal dependable good friend nothing i think every girl needs to love herself regardless of anything like if youre having a bad day if you dont like your hair if you dont have the best family situation whatever you have to love yourself and you cant do anything until you love yourself first in my family we were americans we were republicans and we were methodists no one really wants to admit they are lonely and it is never really addressed very much between friends and family but i have felt lonely many times in my life i think every chef not just in america but across the world has a doubleedged sword  two jackets one thats driven a selfconfessed perfectionist thoroughbred hate incompetence and switch off the stove take off the jacket and become a family man basketball is my passion i love it but my family and friends mean everything to me thats whats important i need my phone so i can keep in contact with them at all times happy or unhappy families are all mysterious we have only to imagine how differently we would be described  and will be after our deaths  by each of the family members who believe they know us i believe with all my heart that america remains the great idea that inspires the world it is a privilege to be born here it is an honor to become a citizen here it is a gift to raise your family here to vote here and to live here no amount of law enforcement can solve a problem that goes back to the family family love is messy clinging and of an annoying and repetitive pattern like bad wallpaper the seven deadly sins want of money bad health bad temper chastity family ties knowing that you know things and believing in the christian religion nixon was the most dishonest individual i have ever met in my life he lied to his wife his family his friends his colleagues in the congress lifetime members of his own political party the american people and the world apparently one in five people in the world are chinese and there are five people in my family so it must be one of them its either my mum or my dad or my older brother colin or my younger brother hochanchu but i think its colin if you have autism in the family history you still vaccinate delay it a bit space them out i am blessed to have so many great things in my life  family friends and god all will be in my thoughts daily at best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love but it is also all too often where we learn nasty things like hate rage and shame i say if everybody in this house lives where its god first friends and family second and you third we wont ever have an argument but the problem is that when i go around and speak on campuses i still dont get young men standing up and saying how can i combine career and family my father was brought up in an orphanage in the catskills he was a factory worker and because his family wasnt there for him family was everything we could disagree inside the house but outside the house it was us against the world so when i became a drag actor he looked sideways but said okay my family and i would never receive royalties on the revenue that my materials brought into the church materials that were created on our own personal time a good job is more than just a paycheck a good job fosters independence and discipline and contributes to the health of the community a good job is a means to provide for the health and welfare of your family to own a home and save for retirement my work and my family are very important to me i refuse to feel guilty i feel guilty about too much in my life but not about money i went through periods when i had nothing so somebody in my family has to get stinkin wealthy everything i have my career my success my family i owe to america probably the worst time in a persons life is when they have to kill a family member because they are the devil but otherwise its been a pretty good day if you have learned how to disagree without being disagreeable then you have discovered the secrete of getting along  whether it be business family relations or life itself my wife and i both come from irish families there are two kinds of irish families the hitting kind and the kidding kind if youre fortunate  and both of us are  you come from the kidding kind of irish family my family kinda hit the skids we were experiencing poverty at that point we all got a job where the whole family had to work as security guards and janitors and i just got angry the practice of patience toward one another the overlooking of one anothers defects and the bearing of one anothers burdens is the most elementary condition of all human and social activity in the family in the professions and in society its hard knowing who to trust with your personal life when you cry in your room at night you dont always know who to call so i am very close to my family the most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers the original meal has never been found think about what people are doing on facebook today theyre keeping up with their friends and family but theyre also building an image and identity for themselves which in a sense is their brand theyre connecting with the audience that they want to connect to its almost a disadvantage if youre not on it now italians come to ruin most generally in three ways women gambling and farming my family chose the slowest one i had this child and it destroyed my family people should watch out for three things avoid a major addiction dont get so deeply into debt that it controls your life and dont start a family before youre ready to settle down i was told to avoid the business all together because of the rejection people would say to me dont you want to have a normal job and a normal family i guess that would be good advice for some people but i wanted to act there is little less trouble in governing a private family than a whole kingdom there is not much less vexation in the government of a private family than in the managing of an entire state the god who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated i do have a close circle of friends and i am very fortunate to have them as friends i feel very close to them i think friends are everything in life after your family you come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise whats the point in life the baby boomers are getting older and will stay older for longer and they will run right into the dementia firing range how will a society cope especially a society that cant so readily rely on those stable family relationships that traditionally provided the backbone of care universal peace sounds ridiculous to the head of an average family the hispanic community understands the american dream and have not forgotten what they were promised  that in the us a free market system allows us all to succeed economically achieve stability and security for your family and leave your children better off than yourselves clearly older women and especially older women who have led an active life or elder women who successfully maneuver through their own family life have so much to teach us about sharing patience and wisdom ive been so fortunate in my life that my family has never been jealous of my success they have shown true love and commitment to me by being supportive they shared in it sure i have friends plenty of friends and they all come around wantin to borrow money ive always been generous with my friends and family with money but selfish with the important stuff like love there are no adequate substitutes for father mother and children bound together in a loving commitment to nurture and protect no government no matter how wellintentioned can take the place of the family in the scheme of things christmas can have a real melancholy aspect cause it packages itself as this idea of perfect family cohesion and love and youre always going to come up short when you measure your personal life against the idealized personal lives that are constantly thrust in our faces primarily by tv commercials as women slowly gain power their values and priorities are reshaping the agenda a multitude of studies show that when women control the family funds they generally spend more on health nutrition and education  and less on alcohol and cigarettes as you age naturally your family shows more and more on your face if you deny that you deny your heritage the virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within ones own family the moment someone chooses to trust in jesus christ his sins are wiped away and he is adopted into gods family that individual is set apart as a child of god with a sacred purpose leftwing politicians take away your liberty in the name of children and of fighting poverty while rightwing politicians do it in the name of family values and fighting drugs either way government gets bigger and you become less free the only sensible ends of literature are first the pleasurable toil of writing second the gratification of ones family and friends and lastly the solid cash i dont have to look up my family tree because i know that im the sap we give a lot of others significance in our lives even when they dont deserve it it doesnt matter if theyre family or if youve known them forever if theyre not good for you theyve got to go if you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and dont think anything of personalities or emotional conflicts or of money or of family distractions it is amazing how quickly you get through those 5000 steps if you have issues with family friends and people at work try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want in that i found being able to talk to my family about my feelings praying for strength and realizing that our lives have a deep purpose and the journey of our lives is to find out what that is and express it was the only way i could have gotten through it everything happens for a reason im used to it i prepare for it like i say at the end of the day those in charge of their own destiny are going to do whats right for them and their family a family is a unit composed not only of children but of men women an occasional animal and the common cold we are special because weve been united not by a common race or ethnicity were bound together by common values that family is the most important institution in society that almighty god is the source of all we have you all know that i have been sustained throughout my life by three saving graces  my family my friends and a faith in the power of resilience and hope these graces have carried me through difficult times and they have brought more joy to the good times than i ever could have imagined i think illness is a family journey no matter what the outcome everybody has to be allowed to process it and mourn and deal with it in their own way gods dream is that you and i and all of us will realize that we are family that we are made for togetherness for goodness and for compassion your ability to communicate is an important tool in your pursuit of your goals whether it is with your family your coworkers or your clients and customers one of the greatest things drama can do at its best is to redefine the words we use every day such as love home family loyalty and envy tragedy need not be a downer my childhood was safe and sane no abuse and no traumas i was surrounded by a large and loving family who taught me the importance of hard work and a meaningful education i think that in a year i may retire i cannot take my money with me when i die and i wish to enjoy it with my family while i live i should prefer living in germany to any other country though i am an american and am loyal to my country in the investigation of a neurotic style of life we must always suspect an opponent and note who suffers most because of the patients condition usually this is a member of the family getting married and starting a family has been a lifelong goal and one that i have persevered through different paths up to it i cannot remember a moment in my life when i have not felt the love of my family we were a family that would have killed for each other  and we still are a man filled with the love of god is not content with blessing his family alone but ranges through the whole world anxious to bless the whole human race and i keep saying whether you like the president or not everybody has to pull together and help the president because as the president goes so goes the country as the country goes so goes your job your ability to feed your family your government rather like batman i embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong good and bad and justice life goes by really fast and it seems that there are times when youre burying a lot of friends and family and then there are times that feel really precious and everybody is doing okay this is one of those times the first pages of memory are like the old family bible the first leaves are wholly faded and somewhat soiled with handling but when we turn further and come to the chapters where adam and eve were banished from paradise then all begins to grow clear and legible i would prefer to have no money but to have a nice family and good friends around ive never had a divorce but ive seen so many of my friends my sister my family go through that stuff so i try to write for the people that cant write about it i take on their sorrow so im able to kind of express it or their joy a real hangover is nothing to try out family remedies on the only cure for a real hangover is death im surrounded by great friends and family i dont know what i would do without them love and fear everything the father of a family says must inspire one or the other in gods family there are no outsiders no enemies family life is too intimate to be preserved by the spirit of justice it can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice holidays are the best i couldnt imagine being from a small family everything family does is reflection on the other people my mother has always been the social glue holding the family together i always put clothes and family photos under the mattress in case the house burns down i know some people say its not the best to work with your family but i have never understood that because its always worked so well for me since im always working my best holiday memories are definitely when i can just go home and spend time with my family i talked about my family my familys so important people think i have courage the courage in my family are my wife pam my three daughters here nicole jamie leeann my mom whos right here too when were dealing with the people in our family  no matter how annoying or gross they may be no matter how selfinflicted their suffering may appear no matter how afflicted they are with ignorance prejudice or nose hairs  we give from the deepest parts of ourselves the breakdown of the black community in order to maintain slavery began with the breakdown of the black family men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldnt have that kind of love it might get in the way of the economics of slavery your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river we will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve samesex marriage and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle you go through life wondering what is it all about but at the end of the day its all about family the police cannot protect the citizen at this stage of our development and they cannot even protect themselves in many cases it is up to the private citizen to protect himself and his family and this is not only acceptable but mandatory it is the logic of consumerism that undermines the values of loyalty and permanence and promotes a different set of values that is destructive of family life leave the matter of religion to the family altar the church and the private school supported entirely by private contributions keep the church and state forever separate ive made all my money on my own without my family and i work very hard i guess you could say i devoted myself so strongly to my music that for awhile i forgot about my family but i only get one set of parents and i think i forgot about that for a little while when families are strong and stable so are children  showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes but when things go wrong  either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship  the impact on a childs later life can be devastating in the past 40 years the united states lost more than a million farmers and ranchers many of our farmers are aging today only nine percent of family farm income comes from farming and more and more of our farmers are looking elsewhere for their primary source of income see thats why baracks running to end the war in iraq responsibly  to build an economy that lifts every family to make sure health care is available for every american  and to make sure that every child in this nation has a worldclass education all the way from preschool to college it all starts with the script its not worth taking myself away from my family if i dont have something im really passionate about historically the family has played the primary role in educating children for life with the school providing supplemental scaffolding to the family i did commit to myself that i would not jump back into being the workaholic that i can be before i gave myself an honest opportunity to create the marriage of my dreams and to create the beginning of the family of my dreams and that took a hot second you know my family and friends have never been yesmen yes youre doing the right thing youre always right no they tell me when im wrong and thats why ive been able to stay who i am and stay humble children in a family are like flowers in a bouquet theres always one determined to face in an opposite direction from the way the arranger desires the cia is made up of boys whose families sent them to princeton but wouldnt let them into the family brokerage business theres a schizoid streak within the family anyway so i dare say that im affected by that the majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution as for my brother he doesnt want to leave he likes it very much let your family staff and friends know that youre still the same person despite all the publicity and notoriety that accompanies your position i come from a family of very devout praying people that idea of peace and love toward humanity shouldnt be nationalistic or denominational it should be a chief concern for all mankind what people dont understand is joining a gang aint bad its cool its fine when you in the hood joining a gang its cool because all your friends are in the gang all your familys in the gang were not just killing people every night were just hanging out having a good time i am not generous about telling people who i am and what i like to do because its my life and it only belongs to me and my friends and family love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a mans starving i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist  although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me i am healthy my family is healthy that is the important thing after that we go racing i realised how paranoid and guarded and not trusting  walledin  i had become not consciously so but just this armour that i kind of have protective armour its not for my friends or family but for beingoutside in the world always on guard im a girl from a good family who was very well brought up one day i turned my back on it all and became a bohemian everybody has basically the same family its just reconfigured slightly differently from one to the next together we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy healthy choice i missed my home  like the physicality of my home i missed my friends and my family mostly and just hanging out and being in your home country  culturally it feels right and that is what i miss leave the presidents family business to him you will have plenty to do without trying to manage the first family they are likely to do fine without your help for the nugent family fast food is a running herbivore but with the steady disintegration of the family in modern society over the last century the role of the school in bridging the gap has become vital i was raised by a single mother who made a way for me she used to scrub floors as a domestic worker put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in brooklyn so i would have food on the table but she taught me as i walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start but where youre going thats family values and when i was young my family was perfectly nice i write a lot about it as you noticed but it was rather limited i think i dont think anyone in my family would really feel id done them an injustice by saying that we didnt see many people there were many books it was as if i wanted to get away from home like family we are tied to each other this is what all good musicians understand my parents were french and irish and our family even has spanish bloodand i do so love the united states and consider myself part american i just want my family to be safe because i am sometimes polarizing i fear for their safety people under the influence of cults is similar to that we observe in addicts typical behaviour for both includes draining bank accounts neglecting children destroying relations with family and losing interest in anything except the drug or cult the question of the family now divides our society so deeply that the opposing sides cannot even agree on a definition of the institution they are arguing about my family got all over me because they said bush is only for the rich people then i reminded them hey im rich there can be hope only for a society which acts as one big family not as many separate ones my kids say if theres any family dinner that doesnt result in somebody crying its not a good dinner they cry because it helps relieve them of a guilt or some onerous emotional burden its like a family tradition growing up in a particular neighborhood growing up in a workingclass family not having much money all of those things fire you and can give you an edge can give you an anger im healthy have a loving and adorable family great hunting dogs a gravity defying musical career and most importantly fuzzyheaded idiots hate me do it no matter what if you believe in it it is something very honorable if somebody around you or your family does not understand it then thats their problem but if you do have a passion an honest passion just do it because i didnt have brothers i was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family so i became one of them  but it was not my family ive always been attracted to temporary families they tend to be lost characters woman is the salvation or the destruction of the family she carries its destiny in the folds of her mantle i love when i go out and i have my hair and makeup done but i also like it when im just with the family because thats real in five years time id like to be a mum i want to settle down and have a family definitely sooner rather than later id like to have finished my second album too maybe even my third id like a sound that sticks around that other people are inspired by and that people know is me my mom is the backbone not just of my family but of many families familys first and thats what matters most we realize that our love goes deeper than the tennis game im thankful to my family friends and fans for all of their support over the last couple of years ive really worked toward balancing my life out more having a little bit more time with friends family and my boyfriend there was a period of time when they were way down the list it was all about music and touring and if everything fell by the wayside so be it it is time to return to core values time to get back to basics  to selfdiscipline and respect for the law to consideration for the others to accepting responsibility for yourself and your family  and not shuffling it off on other people and the state theres a bond among a kitchen staff i think you spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family i really love being alive i love my family and my work i love the opportunity i have to do things thats what happiness is the true poet for me is a priest as soon as he dons the cassock he must leave his family the only people that you really have that i learned are your family because they love you no matter what when i do get the chance i just love to hang around at home with friends and family women are in my view natural peacemakers as givers and nurturers of life through their focus on human relationships and their engagement with the demanding work of raising children and protecting family life they develop a deep sense of empathy that cuts through to underlying human realities a family on the throne is an interesting idea it brings down the pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life one thing that was passed on from generation to generation in my family over seven generations in 200 years was never give up thats the way we live protecting the institution of marriage safeguards i believe the american family i know im talented but i wasnt put here to sing i was put here to be a wife and a mom and look after my family i love what i do but its not where it begins and ends the steady expansion of welfare programs can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the negro family structure over the past generation in the united states i came from a poor family so working and going to school at the same time was natural it taught me multitasking although we didnt call it that back then i learned i could never be idle i need to be doing many things at once every adolescent has that dream every century has that dream every revolutionary has that dream to destroy the family the greenest home is the one you dont build if you really want to save the earth move in with another family and share a house thats already built better yet live in the forest and eat whatever the squirrels dont want im a teenager but im independent  i have my own apartment i have my own life and i think i have learned more than any of those teenagers have in school i learned to be responsible leaving my family and coming here alone its hard enough to work and raise a family when your kids are all healthy and relatively normal but when you add on some kind of disability or disease it can just be such a burden when you look at prince charles dont you think that someone in the royal family knew someone in the royal family the follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family their friends people who should be supportive going what are you talking about even just seemingly regular career paths but if its not what people expect for you they kind of react funny when you live on the road going home is a place to escape and just be with your family to unwind i am just happy to be part of the nike family i dont see how the party that says its the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century going home and spending time with your family and your real friends keeps you grounded a familys photograph album is generally about the extended family and often is all that remains of it i had to learn my faith and look after my family and i had to make priorities but now ive done it all and theres a little space for me to fill in the universe of music again we must not allow the liberals to move us away from the conservative values of the american past which sustain our present and shall secure our future as for me and my family we will serve god we will serve this constitutional republic we will serve america and so i look at it as a relationship that i have with him that i want to give him the honor and glory anytime i have the opportunity and then right after i give him the honor and glory i always try to give my teammates the honor and glory and thats how it works because christ comes first in my life and then my family and then my teammates being a barrymore didnt help me other than giving me a great sense of pride and a strange spiritual sense that i felt ok about having the passion to act it made sense because my whole family had done it and it helped rationalise it for me i grew up in a family that was multifaceted sexually oriented and pretty much open to everything and because i was working my friends were all adults i had a tough time going to different schools because people knew me from films and i was the fat child who got beaten up every day i really have created a family i work with the people i love i travel with them i make films with them and im in an office with them so in a weird way  i know i havent birthed a child  i feel that im a part of creating a family its a tribe i love that word when i did et it sort of solidified the only family i know are these film crews these gypsies these filmmakers that was the solidification and the clicking revelations of this is what i want to do with my life and this is where im going to survive i want to make sure my familys straight if you have issues with family friends and people at work try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want think about what you can do so that you are happy with yourself  for instance eating right to feel great and energetic my family isnt really all that different from anyone elses well maybe theyre a bit more entertaining my other family is fleetwood mac i dont need the money but theres an emotional need for me to go on the road again theres a love there were a band of brothers look i think hispanic community  the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative they are faith family and patriotism as a child the family that i had and the love i had from my two parents allowed me to go ahead and be more aggressive to search and to take risks knowing that if i failed i could always come home to a family of love and support i have let my family down and i regret those transgressions with all of my heart i bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff and as soon as i could i wasted a lot of money on cars  bmws mostly  for myself and my family it is awesome to feel you are carrying on the family name my inspiration was my mom shes a great cook and she still cooks and we still banter back and forth about cooking growing up in a mostly portuguese community food was important and the family table was extremely important at a very young age i understood that i feel akin to the platypus an orphan in a family a swimmer a recluse part bird part fish part lizard i think the american dream says that anything can happen if you work hard enough at it and are persistent and have some ability the sky is the limit to what you can build and what can happen to you and your family the lover of life makes the whole world into his family just as the lover of the fair sex creates his from all the lovely women he has found from those that could be found and those who are impossible to find i am so excited to let fans in on how important my relationship with my family is to me i hope to motivate mothers and daughters to build lifetimes of memories together and inspire kids around the world to live their dreams my family really does come first it always did and always will men have looked upon the desert as barren land the free holding of whoever chose but in fact each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged owner and would quickly assert the right of his family or clan to it against aggression it was the dumbest thing i had ever seen but its a family thing and i guess its clean family and friends and faith are the most important things in your life and you should be building friendships you know sit with your arm around a little kid and read it not only teaches them to read but it keeps the family strong i dont think a female running a house is a problem a broken family its perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man i want to be a young dad by 25 or 26 i want to see myself like married or start looking for a family i like to be judged by my family and friends because they know me i come from a very nonaccepting family but im very accepting i grew up not really having anything so the idea that i can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus when you live in an alcoholic family or an abusive family you tiptoe you dont want to step on any mines americas a family we all yell at each other it all works out the blues was like that problem child that you may have had in the family you was a little bit ashamed to let anybody see him but you loved him you just didnt know how other people would take it i have a very good family im very fortunate to have a very good family i believe very strongly in the family its one of the things we have in our platform is to talk about it it did remind me of something out of greek mythology  the richest king who gets everything he wants but ultimately his family has a curse on it from the gods the fact that food plays such an important part in my films has everything to do with my family a lot of what im obsessed with is the relationship and the dynamics between people and the family particularly brothers and their father but i also want to have a family with children one day which is very important to me with a family of six there is always something to make create and do together sure climbing mount everest would be cool but thats something i would now like to do as a family big experiences like that i dont want to have on my own anymore i want to share them family comes first youre the only thing they have im not a kid you dont get in this business for anonymity its not like i have posters of myself on the wall but at the same time im kind of ready for a little bit of it but i worry for my little one and my family  their privacy thats what im more protective of my parents were drawn to the idea that there was space and opportunity in australia for the meagre sum of pound10 you could sail your entire family out to australia so thats what my father chose to do my family my parents are hippies i enjoy what im able to give my family my familys lineage is five generations of artists who never made it personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldnt have to mean public confessions i have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves i hurt my wife my kids my mother my wifes family my friends my foundation and kids all around the world who admired me i get 05 seconds to react to a ball sometimes even less than that i cant be thinking of what xyz has said about me i need to surrender myself to my natural instincts my subconscious mind knows exactly what to do it is trained to react at home my family doesnt discuss media coverage my ultimate life dream project is my kids my family i remember driving to north carolina when i was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my moms family in the carolinas there were chains on the car  it was the late sixties  and we were just singing in the car christmas carols the principal contributor to loneliness in this country is television what happens is that the family gets together alone i cant tell you how scary it can be walking onto a movie and suddenly joining this family its like going to somebody elses christmas dinner everyone knows everyone and youre there and youre not quite sure what youre supposed to be doing no doubt the white house thinks the american people know obamas story but since the inauguration weve seen only the presidents present his perfect family his ivy league elegance his effortless mastery of complex issues we never see him sweat and we forget that he ever had to struggle one if you attack my integrity i will defend myself if you attack my patriotism i will defend myself if you come after my family i will counterattack viciously i will destroy you but if each man could have his own house a large garden to cultivate and healthy surroundings  then i thought there will be for them a better opportunity of a happy family life a home is crucial the foundation of a stable family im a strong person im a strong family man im a strong husband and a strong father my mom has made it possible for me to be who i am our family is everything her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence acting is just a way of making a living the family is life im from a lower middle class background all my family were immigrants in my particular instance i came from a family that didnt have anything everything i earned in life i made myself with songs that i wrote at a familys most difficult time i want to make sure at a minimum that they have the very basic of comforts the ability to grieve their loss privately and the knowledge that their country is grateful for their loved ones sacrifice and service if you want to see mankind fully look at a family within the family minds become organically one and for this reason the family is total poetry i had a really wonderful upbringing we were a tight family it was wonderful to grow up with so many siblings we were all just a year or two apart and we were always so supportive of each other i learned everything from my older brother and sister and taught it to my younger sisters i need my family to remind me in a loving and nice way to lighten up i have to make it my job to be careful with my family my wife my family my friends  theyve all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means in a nutshell loving someone is about giving not receiving my dad would give me 10 which is a lot of money when youre 9 to sing at church on tables at restaurants at family functions just about anywhere santa barbara is my hood i mean its not much of a hood but it is definitely like my hood i claim santa barbara like i claim my family im going to be married and buried there the family only represents one aspect however important an aspect of a human beings functions and activities a life is beautiful and ideal or the reverse only when we have taken into our consideration the social as well as the family relationship i come from a great family ive seen family life and i know how wonderful how nurturing and how wonderful it can be we will invest in our people quality education job opportunity family neighborhood and yes a thing we call america too often older women are seen as victims but i know lots of formidable women who have marvellous jobs as well as a full erotic life and children and friends and family i love where im from i dont live there because of the circumstances but all my family is there its whats inside its not whats outside that determines the culture and the feeling our notion of the perfect society embraces the family as its center and ornament and this paradise is not secure until children appear to animate and complete the picture i play with my grandchildren i tend to my garden which i love of course i love to read and family is really what its all about i draw from my family and my friends and i feel like that smalltown person the achievements the materialistic possessions have really become to mean less they mean nothing i am hoping that in this year of the family we will go into our families and reconcile differences i did come from a pretty independentminded family i think my father would have liked to have been an artist actually but i think he didnt quite have perhaps the drive or i dont know i mean he had a family to bring up i suppose i hate the way they portray us in the media if you see a black family it says theyre looting if you see a white family it says theyre looking for food there are just so many stories that are buried on family trees i do not see my family life in any way shape or form as an opportunity for a photo my mother at least twice cancelled our familys subscription to the newspaper i was working on because she was so mad about its treatment of my father as they say in italy italians were eating with a knife and fork when the french were still eating each other the medici family had to bring their tuscan cooks up there so they could make something edible having family responsibilities and concerns just has to make you a more understanding person a retired teacher paid 62000 towards her pension and nothing yes nothing for full family medical dental and vision coverage over her entire career what will we pay her 14 million in pension benefits and another 215000 in health care benefit premiums over her lifetime for the first time ever i was taking the family on the road we stayed with my inlaws which on lifes list of experiences ranks right below sitting in a tub full of scissors there is an overwhelming amount of information available to us all on the web each day not to mention what is shared with us by our family friends fans and followers this necessitates the need to filter through all that information and to decide for ourselves where to put our attention i love my friends and family but i also love it when they cant find me and i can spend all day reading or walking all alone in silence eight thousand miles away from everyone all alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be they say yogi berra is funny well he has a lovely wife and family a beautiful home money in the bank and he plays golf with millionaires whats funny about that im thankful for all the things that this job has given me and my family but probably the thing that i am most proud of throughout my career is that not only myself but my family and the people around me have just been regular people which we are i do believe at the end of the night when youre with your family the character gets hung up on the door like a coat and is there to be taken on the next morning theres an honesty in our family  my kids and i are able to talk about things without me putting the fear of god into them you cannot be happy with your family while being personally unhappy with your work its a catch22 kind of thing because of my own familys service in the us army navy and massachusetts and new york national guard i am a strong supporter of the military and do believe that there are just wars except for naval and air exercises our military should be stationed on american soil where service men and women can lead normal lives in close proximity to family and friends i want to do as little as possible when i finish playing ball  just spend a lot more time with my family i know its a cliche but the whole family is just whacked i mean were all out of our minds theyre the funniest most eccentric bizarre people ive ever met my siblings only solitary men know the full joys of frienship others have their family but to a solitary and an exile his friends are everything parenthood and family come first for me and when im not working im cool with the teletubbies studies have shown that since women have had access to the pill and family planning measures they have made huge gains in both wages and in careers that were dominated by men for families across the uk who are incomepoor but more than that whose lives are blighted by worklessness educational failure family breakdown problem debt and poor health as well as other problems giving them an extra pound  say through increased benefits  will not address the reason they find themselves in difficulty in the first place mental illness is the last frontier the gay thing is part of everyday life now on a show like modern family but mental illness is still full of stigma maybe it is time for that to change if anything interferes with my inner peace i will walk away arguments with family members all that stuff none of it matters it is no longer an unwritten law of american capitalism that industry will attempt to maintain wages at a level that allows a single wage to support a family the family wage has been eroded by the same developments that have promoted consumerism as a way of life in a big family the first child is kind of like the first pancake if its not perfect thats okay there are a lot more coming along im worried about that man or woman sitting around  the coffee table tonight or in their kitchen talking about how are we going to get to work how are we going to have the dignity to take care of our family i have been called a nun with a switchblade where my privacy is concerned i think theres a point where one says thats for family thats for me my sense of the family history is somewhat sketchy because my mother kept a great deal to herself never refuse an assignment except when there is a conflict of interest a potential of danger to you or your family or you hold a strongly biased attitude about the subject under focus the last thing family and friends want is for you to spend money on them that you dont have or that you cant really spare i believe there are three keys to success for me it is keeping my priorities in order its my faith and my family and then the business my friends ask me why i still live with my family but i feel comfortable there weve all been through so much together i know my family and i would always go up to the mountains just for fun we always skied then all of a sudden my brother started snow boarding older brother thing i had to do what he was doing so i started snow boarding i sang in the choir for years even though my family belonged to another church my father was the center of the family and everyone tried to please him thinking back to those earlier days i felt i was weak when i wasnt making movies and then when i was i thought i was weak as a family member soon we saw that money going to women brought much more benefit to the family than money going to the men so we changed our policy and gave a high priority to women as a result now 96 of our four million borrowers in grameen bank are women the first responsibility of the muslim is as teacher that is his job to teach his first school his first classroom is within the household his first student is himself he masters himself and then he begins to convey the knowledge that he has acquired to the family the people who are closest to him i come from a family of losers and ive rejected my family as something i dont want to be like i have an obligation to try to live as long as i can for my family my goal is to get everybody in america to do their family tree if you share a common ancestor with somebody youre related to them it doesnt mean that youre going to invite them to the family reunion but it means that you share dna if you share a common ancestor with somebody youre related to them it doesnt mean that youre going to invite them to the family reunion but it means that you share dna i think its fascinating the bottom line is that wanda sykes has the longest continuously documented family tree of any africanamerican we have ever researched my family and our neighbors and friends thought of africa and its africans as extensions of the stereotyped characters that we saw in movies and on television in films such as tarzan and in programs such as ramar of the jungle and sheena queen of the jungle you can say i had a severe case of roots envy i wanted to be like alex haley and i wanted to be able to do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the middle passage as i like to put it and find the tribe or ethnic group that i was from in africa so when you do your family tree and margaret cho does hers and wanda sykes and john legend were adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the american experience and thats the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship the death of any man aged 56 is very sad for his widow and family and no one would deny that steve jobs was a brilliant and highly innovative technician with great business flair and marketing ability it seems to me that unless you or someone very close to you has had a bad head injury you really cant fathom it you have no concept of what it is all about it was so difficult for my whole family not just me seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend i come from an italian family one of the greatest and most profound expressions we would ever use in conversations or arguments was a slamming door the slamming door was our punctuation mark you follow any family around youre going to see elation youre going to see disharmony the family teaches us about the importance of knowledge education hard work and effort it teaches us about enjoying ourselves having fun keeping fit and healthy only as far as a man is happily married to himself is he fit for married life and family life in general i have had lots of friends whove been affected by aids and a very good friend of mine oscar moore died of aids and i was with him in his last year quite a bit and of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care i understand what its like to come with your family and to uproot yourself and come to another culture you need a lot of support people say shes got her daughter shes got her husband yeah but she hasnt got anyone else the real estate agent had to go doortodoor in the apartment building we wanted to rent asking if it was ok for this interracial family  my mom is white and i was a 1yearold halfafrican kid  to live in the apartment building the rooneys are very classy theyre very deliberate with their decisionmaking once youre part of that family steeler nation they treat you with respect you dont have a lot of rambunctious players running around in every song i write whether its a love song or a political song or a song about family the one thing that i find is feeling lost and trying to find your way i wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field it had a great psychological effect on the opposing team too theyd never seen anything like it i now have two different audiences theres the one that has been watching my action films for 20 years and the american family audience american jokes less fighting no one can find inner peace except by working not in a self centered way but for the whole human family my grandfathers family used to own a pasta factory in naples and they would go doortodoor selling their pasta so his love of food came from his parents which was then passed down to my mother and then again to me i work more now because at this time of my life i am not disturbed from my aim by outside pressures such as family passionate relationships dealing with who am i  those complications when one is searching for ones self i have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and have a family women are nearly always seen as victims like all best families we have our share of eccentricities of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements im often asked if i regret not going to hollywood im glad i didnt go because if i had i wouldnt have my extended family which is the fabric of my life only recently have i realised how special and unusual it is i have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and also have a family they are nearly always seen as victims music was your real passion this thing you held dear even above family it was this relationship that never betrayed you once it became your job  this thing that was highly visible this thing that became about commerce  thats when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane a ball player has to be kept hungry to become a big leaguer thats why no boy from a rich family has ever made the big leagues for those who are able to work work has to be seen as the best route out of poverty for work is not just about more money  it is transformative its about taking responsibility for yourself and your family id like to have a family whenever i have friends over we end up eating and talking and losing track of time and once in a while singing karaoke it reminds me of the family meals we had in russia which always lasted a very long time thats a tradition i miss my family and i built my whole career from scratch my family is awesome i support concrete and progressive immigration reform based on three primary criteria family reunification economic contributions and humanitarian concerns i cant imagine dating a boy meeting him only outside the home whats a home and family for if its not the center of ones life my wife a schoolteacher very disciplined if you think im tough trust me and wait till you see when the children are on the naughty step its hilarious so we decided that im going to work like a donkey and provide amazing support for the family the dirty little secret is that the pool man whos making 30000 a year is subsidizing the milliondollar mortgage for the family whose pool he cleans no wonder people want to get rid of tax breaks for corporate jets my father who died a few years ago was a good simple very honest man his faith and affection for his family was just unassailable without question you go to a restaurant in the states and kids have these game boards at the table you dont see that in italy or spain its not because they cant afford to buy them its because thats not what eating together as a family is about stay out of the sun because it is the worst thing in terms of aging im very medical i come from a medical family i dont hide my feelings but when it comes to illness i guess i dont panic my father was the same way im the provider for the family and the caretaker if i panic who is anybody going to run to if you dont have public hangings for bad culture in a company if you dont take people out and let them say they went home to spend more time with the family its crazy i am suspending my presidential campaign because of the continued distractions the continued hurt caused on me and my family not because we are not fighters not because im not a fighter thats a central part of philosophy of ethics what do i owe to strangers what do i owe to my family what is it to live a good life those are questions which we face as individuals catholic school graduates exhibit a wide variety of qualities that will not only help them in their careers but also in their family and community lives i grew up in a navy family we were never a family that had a lot we had enough but not a lot growing up in an italian family you use a harsh tone and 10 minutes later everybody forgets about it family life was wonderful the streets were bleak the playgrounds were bleak but home was always warm my mother and father had a great relationship i always felt safe there fundamentalists are panicked by the apparent disintegration of the family the disappearance of certainty and the decay of morality fear leads them to ask if we cannot trust the bible what can we trust the universal declaration of human rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society it follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself and cannot be made by anyone else theres something about being with a group of people who become like family that must be needed in society in turkey youre not allowed to be left alone in the hospital the nurse teaches the family how to do things and somebody is always there with the patient young actors often dont think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes they want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited and then end up embarrassing family friends and even strangers i just want to be healthy and stay alive and keep my family going and everything and keep my friends going and try to do something so that this world will be peaceful that is the most ambitious and the most difficult thing but im there trying to do it you dont have to give birth to someone to have a family i grew up in a family where the women were just nuts they didnt stand around in cardigans making polite conversation while they chopped tomatoes i am very lucky i have a very tight group of friends and a very supportive family and to this date noone has ever sold a story on me im lucky to have family around me otherwise ill be taking the risk of falling in love with myself i want to apologize to all of the people i have let down because of my behavior which has reflected badly on my family friends coworkers business associates and others women know what men have long forgotten the ultimate economic and spiritual unit of any civilization is still the family the bible is the great family chronicle of the jews even if you plan a marriage and a family you are never quite prepared for the reality versus how you imagined it in a lot of ways its better and in a lot of ways its worse thats life right but when you lose a family member or something tragic happens that stays with you forever you never get over it knowing that you have to deal with that for the rest of your life football is important but not as important as you once thought it was doing saturday night live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family because you feel so much pressure to do well that night but i think everyones grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show we have a president who stole the presidency through family ties arrogance and intimidation employing republican operatives to exercise the tactics of voter fraud by disenfranchising thousands of blacks elderly jews and other minorities by the time i was 30 nobody would work with me i was friendless i was hopeless i was suicidal lost my family  i mean it was bad bottomed out didnt know what i was going to do i actually thought i was going to be a chef  go to work in a kitchen someplace never write an advertisement which you wouldnt want your family to read you wouldnt tell lies to your own wife dont tell them to mine growing up i was taught that a man has to defend his family when the wolf is trying to get in you gotta stand in the doorway what i got which was unusual especially as a child actress was parents who believed that hollywood was not that important they told us education family health all come first and they meant it all my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets andor people i have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way i think the family movie is very important to everybody right now im getting older now so i should think about a family but certainly not tomorrow im less worried about accomplishment  as younger people always cant help but be  and more concerned with spending my time well spending time with my family and reading learning things if you see a black family its looting but if its a white family they are looking for food my own mother always taught me that fairness was a family value  i think equal pay is about fairness for everyone i always tried to do things by example even though i was not a very good mother regarding routines and family life being rich is a good thing not just in the obvious sense of benefitting you and your family but in the broader sense profits are not a zero sum game the more you make the more of a financial impact you can have people had this image of the jacksons as the perfect american family and i destroyed that image but what people have to understand is writing that book was very healing for me i married him because he told me it was the only way he could protect me if we were just manager and client my family could do whatever they wanted to get me back but if i was his wife they couldnt i cant say its not painful being estranged from most of my family i wish it could be otherwise outside of being home with my family i prefer a crowd ive never had a very closely connected family my parents split up when i was young and i was living with my mom for a little while then i was kind of just on my own really young it wasnt some kind of global tragedy it was just never really a very closeknit family so there was support in the sense that they didnt stand in my way ap promoted me to the white house beat because i knew clinton his family friends and staff better than anybody in the national press corps those contacts helped me break a few stories and get my career in washington jumpstarted we all wish we could be in more than one place at the same time people with families feel guilty all the timeif we spend too much time with our family we feel were not working hard enough you know every family and every business in california knows what it means to go through tough times i was one those kids who had books on them before weddings bar mitzvahs funerals and anything else where youre actually meant to not be reading my family would frisk me and take the book away if they didnt find it by this point in the procedure i would be sitting over in that corner completely unnoticed just reading my book a growing awareness of the depth of popular attachment to the family has led some liberals to concede that family is not just a buzzword for reaction when you look at a family if you have a family that never interacts with each other never has strong conversation with each other never has disagreements nine times out of ten you have a very cold family and theyre not going to be at the end theyre not going to be close i dont have a saviour or a royal family most evangelicals claim to be politically nonpartisan and say they only identify with the republican party because the republicans are committed to family values i for one am quite willing to join the forgive forget and move on crowd but it does make me wonder if evangelicals are going to sound believable when they say that they tend to vote republican because of their religious commitments to the family the traditional spokespersons for the evangelicals such as chuck colson and james dobson have become alarmed about this drift away from the family values issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of evangelicals they have expressed their displeasure in letters of protest circulated through the religious media i only tour in short bursts im only ever away from my family and three daughters for a month or two everybody sung in my family well i have a cbe and i accepted it with glee because its not bestowed on you by the royal family its not bestowed on you by the government you have to be nominated by the public i have often noticed that ancestors never boast of the descendants who boast of ancestors i would rather start a family than finish one blood will tell but often it tells too much they needed someone to write a script of the great gatsby very quickly for the movie they were making i took this job so id be sure to have some dough to support my family i had a number of very strong personalities in my family my father was a concert flutist the solo flute for toscanini for my own family i would always choose the makeshift surrogate family formed by various characters unrelated by blood i think thats become passe but if you can surround yourself with a kind of monument to yourself and your family  a statement  and you can afford it then thats a noble project im not ready to get married but i have a pretty great family and id like that too someday i have a great family by the way but you need to find people who can pull something out from you that might be otherwise unseen its not an accident that both my sister and i are writers our parents created an accidental petri dish my family has great storytellers and i grew up in a very funny conversational house and didnt have television this small family farm was a bubble world that didnt have much to do with reality a family is very special so when a family splits up its not good its never good it never occurred to me that i wouldnt go to college and have a career  as well as a family  of my own both my parents but especially my mother encouraged me and led me to believe that it was possible after all is said that can be said upon the liquor traffic its influence is degrading upon the individual the family politics and business and upon everything that you touch in this old world i grew up in a family of strong women and i owe any capacity i have to understand women to my mother and big sister they taught me to respect women in a way where ive always felt a strong emotional connection to women which has also helped me in the way i approach my work as an actor life is not a matter of place things or comfort rather it concerns the basic human rights of family country justice and human dignity i dont think quantity time is as special as quality time with your family interesting things come your way but as you get older your lifestyle changes i dont want to travel i dont want to be in a hotel room away from my family we all started snowboarding in the beginning as a family just to be closer together go on trips it was our soccer but instead of dad yelling at me from the sideline he is there riding with me and hitting the jumps even before i am hitting them in every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it and given a family character as it were to the century family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the 90s version of it instead of just watching you can do it together something we dont spend enough time on we can motivate and excite each other about fitness my priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now thats a huge huge thing i think everybody has their own way of looking at their lives as some kind of pilgrimage some people will see their role as a pilgrim in terms of setting up a fine family or establishing a business inheritance everyones got their own definition nobody in my family ever thought that id a be a model i miss my family and i like being a tourist when i go back we need to recognise that what really matters isnt buying more and more consumer goods but family friends and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives helping to reduce the appalling consequences of world poverty should be part of that reassessment theres no road map on how to raise a family its always an enormous negotiation if you wish to spare yourself and your venerable family give heed to my advice with the ear of intelligence if you do not you will see what god has willed individual responsibility hard work paying attention in school faith family all these things are important i think its been a little difficult at times for the audience because theyve told me they see me as a family member so to see your little sister sing about sex i think they are pretty used to it now the secret is to make sure your family comes before anything else because no matter what you do youve got to come home i want a baby and i want a family for sure syria should not belong to one family to one coterie or to one party it belongs to all the people of syria equally in all their religious and ethnic diversity my family is my life and ill never lose that i guess now that i think back i used to play priest and be a funny priest i dont know i grew up in such a catholic family that i kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and i think i had fun watching my mom laugh in the family sandwich the older people and the younger ones can recognize one another as the bread those in the middle are for a time the meat ive been screaming at the top of my lungs at my family work out work out old age is coming im still very connected to my family to the world i grew up in i understand what it means to be afraid that you cant pay a doctors bill or to have to make the choice between buying a band uniform for a seventhgrader and making the insurance payment on time that will never leave me it was how i lived until i was well into my adult years like a lot of you i grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class my daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man after he had a heart attack my mom worked the phones at sears so we could hang on to our house i do all of the grocery shopping in my little family i buy cheese of many different kinds sliced packaged meats and poultry bagels immense quantities of eggs premade fried chicken milk bacon it is insane how much dairy deli and bakery stuff i buy personally i think four is the perfect number of children for our particular family four is enough to create the frenzied cacophony that my husband and i find so joyful liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family as a novelist i mined my history my family and my memory but in a very specific way writing fiction i never made use of experiences immediately as they happened i needed to let things fester in my memory mature and transmogrify into something meaningful opponents of capital punishment argue that the state has no right to take a murderers life apparently one fact that abolitionists forget or overlook is that the state is acting not only on behalf of society but also on behalf of the murdered person and the murdered persons family during the periods in my marriage when i chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney it caused me no end of anxiety despite the fact that i knew i was contributing to our family by caring for our children i still felt that my worth was less because i wasnt earning for all of higher civilizations recorded history becoming a man was defined overwhelmingly as taking responsibility for a family family farms and small businesses are the backbone of our communities my works never been accepted by my family but its something ill always carry on with i am a big fan of smelly cheeses but the rest of the family dont seem to be particularly keen on them i love being around my friends and my family and spending time with my husband i like being normal and recharging my batteries and i feel like i have the coolest job in the world where i get to get on stage and perform and get to do a lot of really amazing things when there is time to think about cricket i think but when there is time to be with family i try to do justice to that aspect of my life as well many a man who pays rent all his life owns his own home and many a family has successfully saved for a home only to find itself at last with nothing but a house ive been to all 50 states and traveled this whole country and 90 percent of the people are good folks the rest of them take after the other side of the family my wife is so analytical with raising kids and i am not my feeling is if they turn out good then that means i was a good daddy and put a lot of effort into it if they turn out bad it means they took after her side of the family my father never talked about the sacrifices that the family made for me its not common for a woman on television especially if shes the mom of the family to be funny shes usually a straight man or foil its long been accepted as fact that the availability of family planning services saves lives where women have access to these services children and families are healthier and society at large benefits i cant move back to england my home is in france now id love to but i cant my familys all there now i always wanted my music to influence the life you were living emotionally  with your family your lover your wife and at a certain point with your children adoption has been a part of my life and a part of my family so it was how i wanted to start it felt natural and right to me i want my family to resemble the family i came from the town the team its a family that has helped for some people who have had to deal with some of the problems i have had to deal with dont have football as an out we really were a very musical family father managed to buy us a small pump organ and i just loved this instrument by 1969 when i celebrated 45 years in the music business i also had 45 people in our musical family this character feels so much like my brother he has two children he has a wife he works with me he chooses to stay in new hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with he doesnt want them to lose friends he is his familys hero the problem with me as far as getting married and having a family is that my comedy is so important to me so i dont know if ill ever be as good a dad as my dad sometimes you cant prioritise family and you feel guilty ive always wanted to do a family movie i have other obligations now  the show my family my life though i know that without my sobriety i wouldnt have any of those things when i was working and when i was making substantial amounts of money i always filed and paid my taxes this only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society in order to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of myself and my family the pictures of my family were designed to be on a family wall they were supposed to be together it was supposed to copy my mothers wall in her house you never know when some small thing will lead to a big idea travel is very inspirational  but its in the ordinary that i find my themes of love and work and family the monarchy is foremost a business and its important to them that the british public continue to finance the excessive luxurious lifestyles of the now quite enormous wasteful and useless royal family i find it very sad american horror is the debasement of the suburban family the way a lonely kid would have imagined it in the seventies im not an anarchist but i believe that people dont want the royal family  the socalled royal family my dad was a militant atheist or is a militant atheist my mum was sort of bought up in a religious family because she was a protestant from ireland but wasnt especially religious if you want to really know what your friends and family think of you die broke and then see who shows up for the funeral i have a mother thats very strong and family that surround me and constantly tell me they love me i approached everything my job my family my romances with intensity none of my actions have ever sort of been motored by the search for a husband or wondering if i was going to have a family someday or wanting to live in a really great house or thinking it would be really great to have a diamond a lot of parents never speak to their transgender kids again thats not the case in my family the purpose of the seder to my mind is to inspire conversations with your family about the human drama and hopefully transmit values to the next generation ive always felt like this could be better we need a better way to talk about eating animals a way that doesnt ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits cravings family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation the more they are allowed in the more able we will be to follow our best instincts im happiest with my family around me all the songs i write are about human dynamics whether its with girlfriends boyfriends or family we expect teachers to handle teenage pregnancy substance abuse and the failings of the family then we expect them to educate our children i eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything everything in moderation i know thats really hard for people to understand but i grew up in an italian family where we didnt overdo anything we ate pasta yes but not a lot of it when i go back to family reunions everybody goes hey cousin hey auntie and im like okay i dont know you i have no idea who you are i am auntie and cousin for so many and even the ones in prison call me collect and ill be like which of my family members are giving you this phone number im the git in the family a loving family provides the foundation children need to succeed and strong families with a man and a woman  bonded together for life  always have been and always will be the key to such families people can undergo a sudden change of thinking and loyalties under threat of death or intense social pressure and isolation from friends and family i would look at a dog and when our eyes met i realized that the dog and all creatures are my family theyre like you and me my family and friends treat me as they always have my health and my family are the core of my being broken relationships are a source of heavy heartbreak that seem to affect every family i do come from a strong family liberals subscribe to the new flexible pluralistic definition of the family their defense of families carries no conviction most women are pragmatists who have allowed extremists on the left and right to manipulate the family issue for their own purposes the last three decades have seen the collapse of the family wage system the left ask people to believe that there is no conflict between feminism and the family im not asking that people accept homosexuality im not asking that they believe like i do that its inborn im not asking that all im saying is dont let these children suffer without a family because of your bias the left sees nothing but bigotry and superstition in the popular defense of the family or in popular attitudes regarding abortion crime busing and the school curriculum if you go from a structure where you have the support and that partner and that construction of a family and thats broken apart i think thats probably a lot harder than always being a single mom and having the father being a support in another area when liberals finally grasped the strength of popular feeling about the family they cried to appropriate the rhetoric and symbolism of family values for their own purposes how do you rebel in a family of rebels my dads whole family is in madras and i was born in america so we didnt have that big indian community i dont really have anything interesting to say about it when i talk about it people are like meh lets talk about something else i am like a kid i tell my family and friends im like a kid you might think that after thousands of years of coming up too soon and getting frozen the crocus family would have had a little sense knocked into it from very early on in my childhood  four five years old  i felt alien to the human race i felt very comfortable with thinking i was from another planet because i felt disconnected  i was very tall and skinny and i didnt look like anybody else i didnt even look like any member of my family a rumor that followed me forever was that my family was in the mafia for years i had to live with it theyd call me the mafia princess so i rolled with it for the rest of high school people even joke about it today instead of plotting the demise of the traditional family as some politicians and religious leaders would have you believe gay people mow their lawns and watch american idol and video their childrens concerts and have the same hopes and dreams that their straight counterparts do my whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes my encounters with racism are sort of secondhand situations where i might be standing around with a group of white friends and someone makes a comment that they wouldnt make at my family reunion heres the thing the unit of reverence in europe is the family which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in america here we revere the couple there they revere the family sometimes you struggle so hard to feed your family one way you forget to feed them the other way with spiritual nourishment everybody needs that thank you to everyone that has made me the athlete i am god family and friends my competitors and supporters you have all had a hand in my family in the days prior to television we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously my idea of perfect happiness is a healthy family peace between nations and all the critics die one person may need or want more leisure another more work one more adventure another more security and so on it is this diversity that makes a country indeed a state a city a church or a family healthy onesizefitsall and that size determined by the state has a name and that name is slavery our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit santa who was jolly  but lets face it he was also very judgmental the family is the school of duties  founded on love my family were from jamaica i believe in god family truth between people the power of love my family always had the value of the family table and these cultural influences of growing up well be going to the fish market and a farmers market this afternoon to get what we need to make and eat dinner as a family im trying to expose my kids to going to a farmers market or the fish market and learning what thats all about when nirvana became popular you could very easily slip and get lost during that storm i fortunately had really heavy anchors  old friends family my mother was passionate she was stubborn the dominant one in the family she dominated my father my mother was the first woman in the county in indiana where we were born in jay county to have a college degree she was educated as a pianist and she wanted to concertize but when the war came she was married had a family so she started teaching at this time when i turn 50 because so theres many of my friends and family who didnt get to see 50yearsold and so im celebrating for them too there is only one way to solve the alleged crisis of the erosion of family values and that is to get right down to the root cause of the problem my family you know are all still you know very close were all still very close mom and daddy are still alive so what more can you ask for your kids are healthy my whole familys been in the business my whole family is crazy my goals have changed throughout my life at one time it was winning awards selling out concert dates selling more albums than anyone else now my goals are to see my grandchildren grown live a long and healthy life with my family and friends and travel the world if you want to look at the state of humans you should look at the state of animals first people are choosing whether or not they can feed an animal and their family and every shelter coasttocoast is stuffed diabetes affects my family one of my kids is affected by it i really appreciate family i really cant imagine life without them its a tremendous responsibility to be direct descendants of the prophet muhammad this family has had the burden of leadership on its shoulders for 1400 years im not going to drop the ball on my shift at one point in my life i was very involved with social causes im still involved but now i have a family and its important to me i have one friend that ive had since i was born and shes from coatzacoalcos shes not really impressed or interested in the actors life my family isnt really either from those to whom much is given much is expected i have been given much  the love of my family the faith and trust of the people of new york and the chance to lead this state i am deeply sorry that i did not live up to what was expected of me i have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my or any sense of right and wrong i apologize first and most importantly to my family i apologize to the public whom i promised better well one of the most important things for americans to be reminded of is that a lot of the exceptional nature of our country is founded in judeochristian values that promotes individualism personal responsibility a strong work ethic and a commitment to family charity im an actor im not a politician i always kick myself when i talk too much about family or personal things look ive got incredible pride for my family ive absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly there was a great complexity to my father he was a devoted family man but in the same breath he simply was not suited to an anchored life he should have been somebody who had a backpack an old map a bit of change in his pocket and that was it  roaming the world i can make dressing  or stuffing yall call it stuffing up here we call it dressing down there its really good dressing that family recipe was passed on and i love to make that if you feel rooted in your home and family if youre active in your community theres nothing more empowering the best way to make a difference in the world is to start by making a difference in your own life i text a lot people because its how i stay connected with all my family and friends when im on set and traveling my family belongs to a tennis club in valencia california so i always go there i play a lot of tennis with my dad and swim and i like to go to the gym there experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster and it showed me firsthand the importance of every family having access to good health care its very hard to make arguments about the effects of cloning on family relations if family relations are in tatters my family is from the south and i can remember all those ladies i grew up with like my greataunts who had handkerchiefs theres something sweet about them my kids are the future of the mayweather family and of the mayweather brand i feel our family is stronger if we stay together i have a really really really normal family and by normal i mean were all nuts on some level i think youve gotta be a little nuts to pursue any kind of creative job i was also a really good kid i know that sounds really dull but i didnt rebel in the traditional sense selfishness narcissism being uncomfortable in your own skin not feeling connected to the world around you feeling dislocated from family and youth having a strange relationship with your childhood  all those things feel really true to me i have a family the kitchen really is the castle itself this is where we spend our happiest moments and where we find the joy of being a family my humanitarian work evolved from being with my family my mom my dad they really set a great example for giving back my mom was a nurse my dad was a school teacher but my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people she would do home visits for free given my last position that i was the first us attorney post 911 in new jersey i understand acutely the pain and sorrow and upset of the family members who lost loved ones that day at the hands of radical muslim extremists and their sensitivities and concerns have to be taken into account it sounds cliche but success is your friends your family what you do and if youre happy when you wake up i think the hispanic community the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative they are faith family patriotism i contribute my best in my sport and i also have a ton of respect for myself and my family ones nativity is not of his own choosing but whatever it may be it is entitled to respect and all nations have honorable place in the worlds family fame is a lot of pressure especially when youre responsible for your entire family financially emotionally  everything i was the first person to go to university from my family you should be able to afford health care for your family you should be able to retire with dignity and respect and you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger go even farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine i know you care is really personal and fragile for me for me its about losing a family member and also about a breakup its about this idea of losing someone for good getting and keeping my immunity became very important to me for i needed to take care of myself and my family no one else was worried about me i was the black sheep of the family and my mother never really understood me of course i will continue to share my favorite southern recipes just like my mama grandmother and family shared with me over the years and now ill be adding a little bit of a lighter touch to some of these wonderful dishes what weve tried to do is have neighbors colleagues friends and family talking long before we understand ourselves through the process of selfexamination we understand ourselves in a selfevident way in the family society and state in which we live alzheimers parkinsons brain and spinal cord disorders diabetes cancer at least 58 diseases could potentially be cured through stem cell research diseases that touch every family in america and in the world when you go to the movies with your whole family its a different experience for some reason its something that youre all doing together and you take away something special in that i was the oldest of the children in my family i had to do a lot of diaperchanging and lunchmaking i was taking my little sister to ballet picking up my brother sort of being a supernanny and having a strong family you know weve lost some members of our family and had some setbacks but i think a good family and kids all those things i thought at one time you got to be kidding me those things are so important they enable you to go on well family is obviously the most important there was a time when i thought football was the most important in spite of reports about playing with various teams im enjoying retirement with my family and have no plans to play football i enjoy being busy i really do remember im the stub end of the railroad i have no family so im not taking busy time away from people that i should be spending it with so im just relaxing and enjoying it its a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year thats why its a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are im thinking of a legacy that i can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college so world domination  in terms of providing for my family  is absolutely my goal when i do get free time i spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and i think thats what keeps me happy healthy grounded and totally in check my rule is whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now because i dont like it when my family or close friends call me nicki minaj to me im not nicki minaj when im with them what i want to do is tell stories about normal people in the american suburbs i dont write the book where its a conspiracy reaching the prime minister i dont write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads my setting is a very placid pool of suburbia family life and within that i can make pretty big splashes a racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family frankly im fairly boring or fairly busy between writing and family i have little time for anything else if im not writing well im not happy if im not spending enough time with my family im not happy if im not connecting to friends or if i dont work out enough you get the point everything has to be balanced nothing should be an extreme i always wanted to be a farmer there is a tradition of that in my family the royal family to me are not england and they are not the flag my family although theyre very large on both my parents sides they dont know much about their family tree occasionally they try to dig but they cant get very far and its baffling in dublin it seems that so many public records were wiped out its proven to be very difficult so i know very little anyone that has a job that takes them away from home i think can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency not only with your family and those you love but with your friends im not sure why no one wants to admit theres a viable audience out there that believes in god and wants to see a movie with their family the demand is there the supply is not make space in your life for the things that matter for family and friends love and generosity fun and joy without this you will burn out in midcareer and wonder where your life went jews have deep respect for the queen and the royal family we say a prayer for them every sabbath in synagogue we recite a special blessing on seeing the queen whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy to try to do it by placing the entire burden on women  91 of singleparent families in britain are headed by the mother according to census data  is practically absurd and morally indefensible we do not always appreciate the role the queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years the transformation of britain into a multiethnic multifaith society no one does interfaith better than the royal family and it starts with the queen herself i grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world i worry because i dont think my kids are going to have that the world is very scary the world would be scary without the choices the current administration made but they just exacerbated it and it ticks me off i want my kids to have a good life no journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where i live i dont parade my family out for display which is the way it will stay ive always wanted to get into acting ever since i was younger id put on shows for my family and run around play dressup all the time i think i was 4 when i told them i wanted to do movies we fight a lot you know but thats family we may be dysfunctional but were still family i like all the families in the uk but what i like about the idea of the royal family is they seem like theyre well educated and theres something admirable about them and the queen she reminds me of my grandma im from a nice suburban middleclass family but my tattoos remind me where ive been if you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your familys life but change your ghettos life make your ghetto a good neighbourhood learn science try to be like mark zuckerberg bill gates and steve jobs if you live in a good neighborhood you drive home and theres a bank theres grocery stores and big houses  but no motels what that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house respectable means rich and decent means poor i should die if i heard my family called decent the countries who do the best in international comparisons whether its finland or japan denmark or singapore do well because they have professional teachers who are respected and they also have family and community which support learning the functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society but on behalf of personality my family moved a lot as a kid we started in colorado where i lived for five years we moved to chicago for two years to san francisco for one year connecticut for seven oregon for a couple years and then i went to school so i was always moving im still always moving there is a common theme though in the stories i have told which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle if im diagnosed with cancer i might become despondent but someone young might not and they might need connections with somebody outside their circle of family because their family is so despondent my family moved a lot as a kid we started in colorado where i lived for five years we moved to chicago for two years to san francisco for one year connecticut for seven oregon for a couple years and then i went to school because i didnt have brothers i was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family so i became one of them  but it was not my family according to the small business administration more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation and 8 percent do not make it to a third i wasnt looking to get into tv my family was in the movie business so i was never interested in that world the summer before i went to culinary school my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that i was making the right decision i think they hoped i would change my mind about culinary school my family truly believes they are better cooks than i am they see me as giada not as a celebrity chef to them im just me  their granddaughter niece etc and theyre older and wiser i like that because it keeps you grounded i want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the united states and has a family that comes i dont care if its a black family from jamaica or a hispanic family from mexico these issues need to be dealt with but they need to be dealt with in the entertaining way a plague on eminence i hardly dare cross the street anymore without a convoy and i am stared at wherever i go like an idiot member of a royal family or an animal in a zoo and zoo animals have been known to die from stares im a strange mixture of my mothers curiosity my father who grew up the son of the manse in a presbyterian family who had a tremendous sense of duty and responsibility and my mothers father who was always in trouble with gambling debts im considered homophobic and crazy about these things and old fashioned but i think that the family  father mother children  is fundamental to our civilisation id be a liar if i said i had a normal family i sometimes wonder if the tragedies my family has suffered are a kind of karmic price for all the fame and fortune the bee gees have had in a couple sometimes one or both people have to give up their personal life dreams and ambitions for the good of the family the financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high when im on my own i can be negative i need my friends and family around to help pick me up if ive had a bad qualifying session i think insecurity plagues a lot of sportspeople i do a lot of writing about my family by measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown i do not believe the picture that some people paint of scottish towns dependent on welfare every time i come here i meet people who are determined to get into work who with the right help are desperate to get off benefits support their family and set an example for their children getting a family into work supporting strong relationships getting parents off drugs and out of debt  all this can do more for a childs wellbeing than any amount of money in outofwork benefits choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people it was a way to choose a new family the extraordinary thing about india is that its such a family place its full of families everywhere god created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine i was lucky my family is wonderful and its funny because most of my best friends come from very large families so it always felt as if i had lots of siblings though in the end i had to leave them and go home i kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid because sorry to say women run the house they run the family they hold things up i mean its like you dont ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything and its kind of amazing i think to show people just how strong women are family is becoming more and more important to me you know most people they want to go to hollywood they want to be a star they want to be a rock star that thought never entered any of our minds the van halen family i love being healthy i get a lot of sleep im a girl who eats and i feel beautiful no matter how i look i have my family to thank for that the name van halen the family legacy is going to go on long after im gone im overjoyed and beyond honored to be a part of the loreal paris family im such a fan of loreal paris not just for all of their amazing products but for what they stand for the whole point of being in this business and being blessed and being successful is that youre able to do things for your friends or your family which means that they can have something special in their lives too i feel my familys needs are a priority im not comfortable with the idea of serving the many and ignoring my family it is from the progeny of this parent cell that we all take our looks we still share genes around and the resemblance of the enzymes of grasses to those of whales is in fact a family resemblance until he lost all his money my father was a successful north london jewish businessman he was unusual among his immediate family in that he was enormously cultured and had an incredible library i dont want to be reincarnated thats for sure when youve had rewarding experiences in your life  a loving family friends  you dont need additional reassurances that youre going to do something with a new cast of characters id just as soon pass wart hogs should sue for libel it is a terrible name and they are fine fellows and devoted family men and it is rare to see one by himself the little woman and the kiddies are usually close at hand you know you only get one family and you have to make it work its a family thats loaded with grudges and passion we come from a long line of robbers and highwaymen in italy you know killers even the voters are going to decide in november who is going to fix their personal family dismay over not having jobs in america they are going to pick mitt romney but in my heart of hearts this is the kind of thing this is what everyone is struggling with in their lives  relationships and family to me its always an interesting area to mine im drawn to it the uk needs a system for family migration underpinned by three simple principles one that those who come here should do so on the basis of a genuine relationship two that migrants should be able to pay their way and three that they are able to integrate into british society the sad events that occur in my life are the sad events that happen to everybody with losing friends and family but that is a natural occurrence as natural as being born i have lived in mumbai for more than 20 years have my domicile here my home and family here ive been through a lot of things in my personal and family life that turned me into a fighter i always strive to be the best i possibly can im lucky the best possible place in the world for training is addis ababa so i am home all the time except when i am racing i like to be there near my family my kids also the real estate business i run with my wife a company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company we dont isolate the family we dont make rides that say hey mom dad you go sit on the bench people just dont laugh when their family is violated and you dont shrug it off you band together and you defend together its a funny primitive instinct family traditions counter alienation and confusion they help us define who we are they provide something steady reliable and safe in a confusing world when i was very little we would get letters from china in chinese and they be censored we were a very insular little family if you want to have a good life you should focus on your family on your business on your dog on your fun and youll have a good life i dont have anything against my mom but my family has no emotional connection to each other i had no fun my family was too serious monarchists frequently declare that without the royal family britain would be nothing what a woeful lack of love for ones country such statements express it has to be real and i think a lot of the problems we have as a society is because we dont acknowledge that family is important and it has to be people who are present you know and mothers and fathers both are not present enough with children it was a source of shame for my family that i was in rock and roll which is so bluecollar it just isnt done and i felt it too what unites oklahomans today is what has always united us our unshakable faith our love of family and compassion for others the unlimited promise of a hopeful future playing guitar was one of my childhood hobbies and i had played a little at school and at camp my parents would drag me out to perform for my family like all parents do but it was a hobby  nothing more of course i regret not having been able to spend time with my family for our immediate family and relatives canada was a land of opportunity one wants to be together with ones family thats what families are about my family can always tell when im well into a novel because the meals get very crummy classical and romantic private language of a family quarrel a dead dispute over the distribution of emphasis between man and nature my mom was a professional my dad and mom met each other in a movie called new faces of 1937 my mom went under the name thelma leeds and she did a few movies and she was really a great singer and when she married my dad and started to have a family she sang at parties a person needs at intervals to separate himself from family and companions and go to new places he must go without his familiars in order to be open to influences to change some of the things you read you get an immediate reaction to so ive stopped reading things now i do worry about my family though some people do try some nasty things to get at them and try and get a reaction from them movies like that arent about the visual effects and explosions theyre human stories about family about life about death if i were to retire i would keep my familys interest in the company the same and say dont sell anybody who is running a marathon or doing a walkathon doing a fundraiser for their school their company by far its guaranteed the easiest and most fun way to quickly set up a fundraising campaign and send it around to your friends and family do not let your bachelor ways crystallize so that you cant soften them when you come to have a wife and a family of your own i have my family my children  i have a lot of outside activities i have a lovely family who supports me and its great i think and i mean this sincerely i was raised humbly we were a lower middle income family and a household that was scrimping by at times we were watching the dollar stretching the dollar and coupons it was all those things the dream was not to put one black family in the white house the dream was to make everything equal in everybodys house when i was a kid i took the brady bunch and the partridge family very seriously it was a world to me in the same way that the greek myths would have been had i read them you know marcia is athena and mr brady is zeus i grew up in a dysfunctional family im a republican i dont want to go to heaven and have to face my family up there and tell them i voted for a democrat but you know we have a very normal family weve had our ups and downs you know weve had our issues but weve had great cause for celebration the clan is nothing more than a larger family with its patriarchal chief as the natural head and the union of several clans by intermarriage and voluntary connection constitutes the tribe the best thing ive done with my money is buy a house for my family you wake up to a house you love and you feel like somebody even though i have a nice house nice family the rest of my generation is still in south central la my cousins my brothers my sisters they dont wanna move out they dont want to and they dont have the means to sustain it thats where my heart is and thats what i think about all the time south central is just who i am even though i have a nice house nice family the rest of my generation is still in south central la my cousins my brothers my sisters they dont wanna move out the warrior may fight for gold or for an immediate gain or for something to take home for the winter to feed the family the soldier is part of a more complex society hes fighting for a group ethic of some sort i went through a period of great rebellion within my family when i was about 9 or 10 i was mad i had no focus had no real interest in anything and so i started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid my fam is just a regular family but all of them have great senses of humor i remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the navy he didnt have to he was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism not just make movies about it i admired this about him my mom always said i was the peacemaker in the family my older brother eric was the leader the creative one i was just his puppet finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing ive ever done  by far when i heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of prince williams marriage i knew i had to give them a little something wet is the perfect anthem for prince william or any playa to get the club smokin it was only for two years and i jumped from family to family its very scary i had the good fortune of having a happy closely knit family i wish i had an extra day with my mom sometimes or another hour in the day with my family husband and children nashville is one of the greatest places for the best songwriters in the world its been fantastic to live there and to raise our family there its a great town i used to be a classic workaholic and after seeing how little work and career really mean when you reach the end of your life i put a new emphasis on things i believe count more these things include family friends being part of a community and appreciating the little joys of the average day i love christmas i really do love christmas i love being with my family and i love snow i love the music and the lights and all of it on the one hand the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me but on the other hand i long for it you know what i mean im constantly in conflict with things and it is because of my past and my upbringing and the journey that ive been on i like being in kids movies and i like being in family movies i dont believe in being mean to anyone im a really peaceful person thats something i get from my family im not a royal family watcher touring is tough youre almost in a haze because you dont really know where you are half the time youre in a hotel room one moment and the next thing you know youre onstage performing for 60000 people then youre back on an airplane its very hectic and i couldnt do it without my family when you have a family or even when youre just seeing a girl its difficult to be skint a fellow oughtnt to let his family property go to pieces for me family always comes first i would do anything to protect them my family went through divorces and remarriages and the later blended home  and then watched that home explode too there arent a lot of ironclad rules of family life but heres one no matter how much your parents deny it  and heres betting they deny it a lot  they have a favorite child and if youre a parent so do you spending 1 for a brand new house would feel very very good spending 1000 for a ham sandwich would feel very very bad spending 19000 for a small family car would feel well more or less right but as with physical pain fiscal pain can depend on the individual and everyone has a different threshold its one of the worstkept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere the favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it  the better to preserve the good thing theyve got going and to keep their siblings off their back theres a sort of sibling moratorium when youre establishing yourself as an adult so much of your energy has to be focused on other things like work and kids but when people become more settled siblings tend to regroup because now youre building a new extended family humans have a fraught relationship with beasts they are our companions and our chattel our family members and our laborers our household pets and our household pests we love them and cage them admire them and abuse them and of course we cook and eat them a close family member once offered his opinion that i exhibit the phone manners of a goat then promptly withdrew the charge  out of fairness to goats coming home to my family afterward makes the work richer easier and more fun equal pay isnt just a womens issue when women get equal pay their family incomes rise and the whole family benefits i grew up in a very oldfashioned roman catholic italianirish family in philly my family has very strong women my mother never laughed at my dream of africa even though everyone else did because we didnt have any money because africa was the dark continent and because i was a girl when i look back over my life its almost as if there was a plan laid out for me  from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to africa and whose family couldnt afford to put her through college everyone laughed at my dreams i was supposed to be a secretary in bournemouth you can be cool and at the same time respect your woman who will hopefully become your wife who will hopefully become the mother of your kids america needs to get back to family values im very excited about my new agreement with the heat this contract allows me to address all of my familys longterm financial goals while allowing the heat the ability to acquire those players that we need to win a championship for me its about the way i carry myself and the way i treat other people my relationship and how i feel about god and what he does for me is something deeply personal its where i came from my family i was brought up in a religious household and thats very important to me while i have felt lonely many times in my life the oddest feeling of all was after my mother lucille died my father had already died but i always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive it seems strange to say now that i felt so lonely yet i did i was always on the go and thought i was too busy to develop something like this i thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits but i was the last one in my family to eat junk food in my family in particular i think there was a sense we have to work twice as hard my mother isolated herself from all family and friends for some 20 years and never met her grandchild my son i grew up in a ukrainian catholicturnedchristian household and that is my familys faith we are a very crafty family i come from a massive family and the youngest is twentysomething years younger than i am so i grew up with children i have a very strong family i just want to have a great relationship with my child and have a great family dynamic as a child i had to get up early for school or work id get ready by myself id set my alarm to wake me up very early in the morning and be off to work the family driver driving me every morning i did it alone my parents never coming in to wake me up i need to work to support my family my dream maybe because of my family of course was to be a painter i chose in one moment the direction of textiles from textiles i went to fashion but for me i thought you made a record you got on a bus went out and played your shows and made a lot of money that was the way it was supposed to go down but theres a lot more to it than that there are a lot of early mornings late nights a lot of traveling a lot of being away from home being away from your family short of baseball and my family it was gaming and gaming is a 20million to 200million multiyear effort its an insane stupid and utterly irresponsible act but i did it i began to speak well at a very advanced age  15 16 17 years old it was psychological the trauma of war my family and growing up on my own i was more or less a street kid i am a universalist passionately devoted to the cause of equality within the human family i love seeing my family you dont have a family doctor anymore like you did when you were a kid who treated you throughout your life my father really was not the dominant person who raised the family it was my mother who raised the family i love film after a yummy meal for the whole family and some truly great friends we often go out to see something beautiful and unique as children we recognized that we belonged to an unusual even exceptional family but the effect was different on each of us the american people know whats necessary to get this economy moving again its fiscal discipline in washington dc and acrosstheboard tax relief for working families small businesses and family farms the royal family are not like you and me they live in houses so big that you can walk round all day and never need to meet your spouse the queen and prince philip have never shared a bedroom in their lives they dont even have breakfast together with the counseling of my family doctor my mother ended up turning to weight watchers and their childrens program i went to weekly meetings got counseling and would exercise with my peers who were my size it was the first time i saw a proper childrens portion size and it wasnt two burgers it was one i was the youngest of my entire family so you are tapdancing to try to get the attention of your older cousins i really hit my social stride in 6th grade but before that i was a pretty big dork you learn how to be amusing and how to work for it to me the kitchen is a place of adventure and entirely fun not drudgery i cant think of anything better to do with family and friends than to be together to create something i always loved family holidays and i had this vision and dream as a little girl of having a big family of my own i think with motherhood and childrearing in general everyones going to tell you how to do it and why ive always said to other mothers and women when theyve asked me that you have to find your own way and find out what works for your family at all costs although my family  parents and sister  all work in the personnel management business their real passion is performing amateur operatic societies and so on film is an illusion fame is ephemeral faith and family are what endure i think tattoos a song that can go so many different ways some people think of it as a breakup song but for me its about somebody who comes into your life and really touches you  be they a friend a family member or someone youre in a relationship with its cool to have parents and family who will always tell me the truth no matter what theyll tell me if im doing something stupid my family was all born in sicily and im italianamerican theyre the real thing theyre authentic italians and honestly theyre the most openminded nicest people in the world and nothing can really offend them thats the way i think true sicilians are i think when someone is injured in your family you want to speak to the individual and you want to hear their voice and you want to make sure they are ok growing up with my family gave me some of my best memories id like to have a family of my own  slip away for a bit and do nothing but spend those early years with my children im over the moon to be involved in the doctor who christmas special i cant quite believe it as its a part of the family tradition at the jenkins household i heard the news that i got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever you have no idea how humiliating it was as a boy to suddenly have all your clothes your toys snatched by the bailiff i mean we were a middleclass family its not as if it was happening up and down the street it made me ashamed i felt dirty i was quite able at the insignificant work i did in mi6 but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life i had no experience of fatherhood i had no example of marital bliss or the family unit i like playing music because its a good living and i get satisfaction from it but i cant feed my family with satisfaction baseball life is a tough life on the family i work six months and get three or four with the family i work six months and get three or four with the family ive stopped racing to get to the red light im very very concerned about the bush presidency im worried about the kinds of cuts in domestic programs that mean something to a lot of people including members of my family who depend on certain things from the government i have a lot of responsibilities outside myself i have a large family i want to know i can always be helpful my family makes these vinegars  out of everything from grapes to peaches and cherries we go through the whole process with the giant vat and drainer label them and give them as christmas presents we dont have the luxury of time we spend more because of how we live but its important to be with our family and friends i tend to show everything i do to my family to check they wont be offended when i was growing up in mississippi  it was good southern food but i also grew up with a greek family when other kids were eating fried okra we were eating steamed artichokes so i think it played a big part in my healthy cooking im just a publicschoolboy ive got a degree im from a middleclass family in devon ive got no story in my family we let our boys have a say in what veggie side they want for dinner that night we list off a handful of options and get them excited about helping to plan the dinner menu theyre much more inclined to finish their plates when theyve helped decide what goes on them to me money is the ability to create lifelong experiences for my family and myself to educate my children and a way to give back to humanity ive always been part of comedy one of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other particularly my two brothers and myself when my father was upset with something youd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh because when he didnt laugh you were in trouble ive been experimenting more and more with ln2 liquid nitrogen ive used it in battle on iron chef america but have also made some great ice creams at home for my family since it freezes basically on contact you can have ice cream ready in mere minutes my family brought me up to be very respectful of people when im home the heart and soul of our family is in the kitchen growing up my parents both worked so dinnertime was for family  the tv was off i think its important to grab that time and really make it special even after a tough day my parents did a great job raising me and my two sisters we all graduated from high school and we all graduated from college so to be a good representative of my family is probably my greatest accomplishment thus far i would like a foodlifestyle show were not sure what that is yet i want to be able to share what i do and how i raise my family i feel like i have a story to tell i enjoy talking and listening sharing ideas and sharing advice and whereas women had to fight to find their way into the workforce men are now fighting to reclaim their place in the family structure ive always known i wanted a family but i am armenian and i understand what it is to lose a country and lose a family and have massacres and genocides and everything against my people more than any other setting  more than battlefields or boardrooms or a spaceship headed for intergalactic travel  ill put my money on the family to provide an endless source of comedy tragedy and intrigue the importance of human life should be universally respected  and that refers to children before they are born and after all children have the right to be brought up in a loving twoparent family where the notion of divorce is not even possible while free choice vouchers didnt fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every american would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their familys health insurance costs
