freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under god is acknowledged for to be free is not merely to cast off ones chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others if you want total security go to prison there youre fed clothed given medical care and so on the only thing lacking is freedom i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do i am free no matter what rules surround me if i find them tolerable i tolerate them if i find them too obnoxious i break them i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err the desire of gold is not for gold it is for the means of freedom and benefit freedom is nothing but a chance to be better people demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use you have freedom when youre easy in your harness freedom is what you do with whats been done to you the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the goverment the truth is i love being alive and i love feeling free so if i cant have those things then i feel like a caged animal and id rather not be in a cage id rather be dead and its real simple and i think its not that uncommon we must be willing to pay a price for freedom liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people perfect freedom is as necessary to the health and vigor of commerce as it is to the health and vigor of citizenship real freedom is having nothing i was freer when i didnt have a cent is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish nothing else for in the end freedom is a personal and lonely battle and one faces down fears of today so that those of tomorrow might be engaged the only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it freedom is a mans natural power of doing what he pleases so far as he is not prevented by force or law i hope for nothing i fear nothing i am free as long as men are free to ask what they must free to say what they think free to think what they will freedom can never be lost and science can never regress freedom and justice cannot be parceled out in pieces to suit political convenience i dont believe you can stand for freedom for one group of people and deny it to others freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it there are two freedoms  the false where a man is free to do what he likes the true where he is free to do what he ought do not allow to slip away from you freedoms the people who came before you won with such hard knocks im a big advocate of freedom freedom of speech freedom of expression freedom of thought we will not waver we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail peace and freedom will prevail none who have always been free can understand the terrible fascinating power of the hope of freedom to those who are not free all theory is against freedom of the will all experience for it what is freedom of expression without the freedom to offend it ceases to exist may we think of freedom not as the right to do as we please but as the opportunity to do what is right freedom is the only law which genius knows you can only protect your liberties in this world by protecting the other mans freedom freedom is from within we are driven by five genetic needs survival love and belonging power freedom and fun freedom rings where opinions clash as human beings we are endowed with freedom of choice and we cannot shuffle off our responsibility upon the shoulders of god or nature we must shoulder it ourselves it is our responsibility our freedom can be measured by the number of things we can walk away from in america through pressure of conformity there is freedom of choice but nothing to choose from i believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy  but that could change enslave the liberty of but one human being and the liberties of the world are put in peril i believe in freedom of speech but i believe we should also have the right to comment on freedom of speech seek freedom and become captive of your desires seek discipline and find your liberty you cannot parcel out freedom in pieces because freedom is all or nothing freedom is the oxygen of the soul freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts were giving our freedoms away the american experiment was about freedom freedom to be stupid freedom to fail freedom to succeed children should have enough freedom to be themselves  once theyve learned the rules freedom from fear could be said to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend people heresy is another word for freedom of thought we do not commonly see in a tax a diminution of freedom and yet it clearly is one freedom is the recognition of necessity there is no such thing as a little freedom either you are all free or you are not free the right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedoms when we lose the right to be different we lose the privilege to be free i chose america as my home because i value freedom and democracy civil liberties and an open society freedom is contagious thats why despots fear it so much free speech carries with it some freedom to listen i need this wild life this freedom freedom is never easily won but once established freedom lasts spreads and chokes out tyranny freedom of the press is not an end in itself but a means to the end of achieving a free society coercion after all merely captures man freedom captivates him freedom is the right to ones dignity as a man human beings crave freedom at their core the link between my experience as an entrepreneur and that of a politician is all in one word freedom we should favor innovation and freedom over regulation the very idea of freedom incites fear in the hearts of terrorists across the world friends can help each other a true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself  and especially to feel or not feel whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them thats what real love amounts to  letting a person be what he really is change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle and so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom a man cant ride you unless your back is bent freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same a friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself expose yourself to your deepest fear after that fear has no power and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes you are free if the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed all the great things are simple and many can be expressed in a single word freedom justice honor duty mercy hope our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits between stimulus and response there is a space in that space is our power to choose our response in our response lies our growth and our freedom those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves the sweltering summer of the negros legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality the best road to progress is freedoms road freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being with freedom comes responsibility for the person who is unwilling to grow up the person who does not want to carry is own weight this is a frightening prospect the cost of freedom is always high but americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission israel was not created in order to disappear  israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom it is by the goodness of god that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things freedom of speech freedom of conscience and the prudence never to practice either of them today i choose life every morning when i wake up i can choose joy happiness negativity pain to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices  today i choose to feel life not to deny my humanity but embrace it freedom lies in being bold in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free  honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth the most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are you trade in your reality for a role you give up your ability to feel and in exchange put on a mask freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made china has to go along with world trends thats democracy liberty individual freedom china sooner or later has to go that way it cannot go backward punk is musical freedom its saying doing and playing what you want in websters terms nirvana means freedom from pain suffering and the external world and thats pretty close to my definition of punk rock it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom in the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger i do not shrink from this responsibility  i welcome it nobody can give you freedom nobody can give you equality or justice or anything if youre a man you take it freedom is never dear at any price it is the breath of life what would a man not pay for living most people do not really want freedom because freedom involves responsibility and most people are frightened of responsibility i am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars all we demanded was our right to twinkle violent means will give violent freedom that would be a menace to the world and to india herself the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are the cost of freedom is always high but americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission i am interested in anything about revolt disorder chaosespecially activity that seems to have no meaning it seems to me to be the road toward freedom rather than starting inside i start outside and reach the mental through the physical if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all i am a republican a black dyed in the wool republican and i never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress a hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom im interested in anything about revolt disorder chaos especially activity that appears to have no meaning it seems to me to be the road toward freedom we cannot expect that all nations will adopt like systems for conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth i believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength americans are so enamored of equality that they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom every human has four endowments self awareness conscience independent will and creative imagination these give us the ultimate human freedom the power to choose to respond to change it is cruel you know that music should be so beautiful it has the beauty of loneliness of pain of strength and freedom the beauty of disappointment and neversatisfied love the cruel beauty of nature and everlasting beauty of monotony the revelation of thought takes men out of servitude into freedom freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose anything less is a form of slavery what is ominous is the ease with which some people go from saying that they dont like something to saying that the government should forbid it when you go down that road dont expect freedom to survive very long money wont create success the freedom to make it will well if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part to us do they i think my first album opened a lot of doors for me to push the freedom of speech to the limit nothing has been purchased more dearly than the little bit of reason and sense of freedom which now constitutes our pride responsibility is the price of freedom a free press can of course be good or bad but most certainly without freedom the press will never be anything but bad a free america means just this individual freedom for all rich or poor or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it let freedom reign the sun never set on so glorious a human achievement the framers of our constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion not freedom from religion communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom because the shortterm objects of communism would always correspond with the longterm objects of freedom movements if society fits you comfortably enough you call it freedom the only certain freedoms in departure i am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the american way of life is freedom limited government and minding our own business overseas where globalization means as it so often does that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom without freedom no art art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself and dies of all others i think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom every tyrant who has lived has believed in freedom for himself religious liberty is the first freedom in our constitution and whether the cause is justice for the persecuted compassion for the needy and the sick or mercy for the child waiting to be born there is no greater force for good in the nation than christian conscience in action i believe in a religion that believes in freedom any time i have to accept a religion that wont let me fight a battle for my people i say to hell with that religion without culture and the relative freedom it implies society even when perfect is but a jungle this is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future men are never really willing to die except for the sake of freedom therefore they do not believe in dying completely only free men can negotiate prisoners cannot enter into contracts your freedom and mine cannot be separated there is no such thing as part freedom we the people recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks whats in it for me a freedom without a commitment to others a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense freedom from effort in the present merely means that there has been effort stored up in the past you can have peace or you can have freedom dont ever count on having both at once i live in america i have the right to write whatever i want and its equaled by another right just as powerful the right not to read it freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend people the liberties of our country the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending against all hazards and it is our duty to defend them against all attacks our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual grace is the beauty of form under the influence of freedom freedom consists not in doing what we like but in having the right to do what we ought this is the highest wisdom that i own freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew books were my pass to personal freedom i learned to read at age three and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in mississippi if youre not ready to die for it put the word freedom out of your vocabulary when freedom does not have a purpose when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women when it does not listen to the voice of conscience it turns against humanity and society there is only one kind of freedom and thats individual liberty our lives come from our creator and our liberty comes from our creator it has nothing to do with government granting it i was ecstatic they renamed french fries as freedom fries grown men and women in positions of power in the us government showing themselves as idiots if we wish to free ourselves from enslavement we must choose freedom and the responsibility this entails i wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom how absurd men are they never use the liberties they have they demand those they do not have they have freedom of thought they demand freedom of speech for more than four decades the libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant  moammar gaddafi he has denied his people freedom exploited their wealth murdered opponents at home and abroad and terrorized innocent people around the world  including americans who were killed by libyan agents you cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom the fight for freedom must go on until it is won until our country is free and happy and peaceful as part of the community of man we cannot rest those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must like men undergo the fatigue of supporting it love does not claim possession but gives freedom necessity is blind until it becomes conscious freedom is the consciousness of necessity we believe in individual initiative personal responsibility opportunity freedom small government the constitution these principles these american principles are key to getting our economy back to being successful and leading the world he only earns his freedom and his life who takes them every day by storm freedom isnt free it shouldnt be a bragging point that oh i dont get involved in politics as if that makes someone cleaner no that makes you derelict of duty in a republic liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didnt insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable our plans protect freedom and opportunity and our blueprint is the constitution of the united states freedom has cost too much blood and agony to be relinquished at the cheap price of rhetoric if i am elected president of these united states i will work with all my energy and soul to restore that america to lift our eyes to a better future that future is our destiny that future is out there it is waiting for us our children deserve it our nation depends upon it the peace and freedom of the world require it a big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the whatifs of life whenever men take the law into their own hands the loser is the law and when the law loses freedom languishes to say that any people are not fit for freedom is to make poverty their choice and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not there are necessary evils money is an important thing in terms of representing freedom in our world and now i have a daughter to think about its really the first time ive thought about the future and what it could be posterity you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom i hope you will make good use of it perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government but from the beginning this nation trusted in god not man religious liberty is the first freedom in our constitution ultimately americas answer to the intolerant man is diversity the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired religious freedom opens a door for americans that is closed to too many others around the world but whether we walk through that door and what we do with our lives after we do is up to us freedom freedom of religion freedom to speak their mind freedom to build a life and yes freedom to build a business with their own hands this is the essence of the american experience history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid anxiety is the dizziness of freedom you dont have freedom because you are a hyphenated american you have freedom because you are an individual and that should be protected we can be thankful to a friend for a few acres or a little money and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth and for the great benefits of our being our life health and reason we look upon ourselves as under no obligation a man may be a pessimistic determinist before lunch and an optimistic believer in the wills freedom after it they wont break me because the desire for freedom and the freedom of the irish people is in my heart the day will dawn when all the people of ireland will have the desire for freedom to show it is then that we will see the rising of the moon and let me make this very clear  unlike president obama i will not raise taxes on the middle class as president i will protect the sanctity of life i will honor the institution of marriage and i will guarantee americas first liberty the freedom of religion we still believe in the america that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom we believe in the america that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves since castro took power the cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms no freedom of religion no freedom of the press no political freedom and the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will your true traveller finds boredom rather agreeable than painful it is the symbol of his liberty  his excessive freedom he accepts his boredom when it comes not merely philosophically but almost with pleasure every friend of freedom must be as revolted as i am by the prospect of turning the united states into an armed camp by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence we are faced with the paradoxical fact that education has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of thought back a hundred years ago especially around woodrow wilson what happened in this country is we took freedom and we chopped it into pieces when one makes a revolution one cannot mark time one must always go forward  or go back he who now talks about the freedom of the press goes backward and halts our headlong course towards socialism pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the muslim ideology which has to be preserved which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which we hope other will share with us the words spoken by the leader of the free world can expand the frontiers of freedom or shrink them when ronald reagan called on gorbachev to tear down this wall a surge of confidence rose that would ultimately breach the bounds of the evil empire make no mistake in this campaign i will offer the american ideals of economic freedom a clear and unapologetic defense president obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience i will defend religious liberty and overturn regulations that trample on our first freedom i dont want to transform america i want to restore to america the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world the secret of freedom lies in educating people whereas the secret of tyranny is in keeping them ignorant there are 4 billion cell phones in use today many of them are in the hands of market vendors rickshaw drivers and others whove historically lacked access to education and opportunity information networks have become a great leveler and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want the worst enemy of life freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy their second worst enemy is total efficiency those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground i believe all americans who believe in freedom tolerance and human rights have a responsibility to oppose bigotry and prejudice based on sexual orientation there can be no real freedom without the freedom to fail freedom in art freedom in society this is the double goal towards which all consistent and logical minds must strive the only way that has ever been discovered to have a lot of people cooperate together voluntarily is through the free market and thats why its so essential to preserving individual freedom no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare when people talk of the freedom of writing speaking or thinking i cannot choose but laugh no such thing ever existed no such thing now exists but i hope it will exist but it must be hundreds of years after you and i shall write and speak no more freedom is hammered out on the anvil of discussion dissent and debate be strong believe in freedom and in god love yourself understand your sexuality have a sense of humor masturbate dont judge people by their religion color or sexual habits love life and your family the more decisions that you are forced to make alone the more you are aware of your freedom to choose freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four if that is granted all else follows you dont have to be a man to fight for freedom all you have to do is to be an intelligent human being emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem there is nothing wrong with america that faith love of freedom intelligence and energy of her citizens cannot cure i know but one freedom and that is the freedom of the mind freedom is not something that one people can bestow on another as a gift thy claim it as their own and none can keep it from them analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible but to give the patients ego freedom to decide one way or another pervading nationalism imposes its dominion on man today in many different forms and with an aggressiveness that spares no one the challenge that is already with us is the temptation to accept as true freedom what in reality is only a new form of slavery a major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that group thinks they ought to want underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself freedom is the most contagious virus known to man freedom in general may be defined as the absence of obstacles to the realization of desires shall i tell you what the real evil is to cringe to the things that are called evils to surrender to them our freedom in defiance of which we ought to face any suffering freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient greek republics freedom for slave owners fear is not in the habit of speaking truth when perfect sincerity is expected perfect freedom must be allowed nor has anyone who is apt to be angry when he hears the truth any cause to wonder that he does not hear it freedom of opinion can only exist when the government thinks itself secure both the american people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom if a nation values anything more than freedom it will lose its freedom and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more it will lose that too we gain freedom when we have paid the full price i know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion as in america perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose ones government is not necessarily to secure freedom the family is the test of freedom because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired but by controlling the desire freedom means the right of people to assemble organize and debate openly what then is freedom the power to live as one wishes freedom is a possession of inestimable value freedom is the right to live as we wish if there is any principle of the constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate freedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free how often i have found that we grow to maturity not by doing what we like but by doing what we should how true it is that not every should is a compulsion and not every like is a high morality and true freedom just living is not enough one must have sunshine freedom and a little flower freedom  to walk free and own no superior forgiveness is the key to action and freedom underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward and freedom will be defended history has taught us over and over again that freedom is not free when push comes to shove the ultimate protectors of freedom and liberty are the brave men and women in our armed forces throughout our history theyve answered the call in bravery and sacrifice the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the states of created beings capable of law where there is no law there is no freedom everywhere that freedom stirs let tyrants fear history suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom clearly it is not a sufficient condition a filmmaker has almost the same freedom as a novelist has when he buys himself some paper in this possibly terminal phase of human existence democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued  they may be essential to survival the greatest threat to freedom is the absence of criticism when there is state there can be no freedom but when there is freedom there will be no state we seek peace knowing that peace is the climate of freedom governments that block the aspirations of their people that steal or are corrupt that oppress and torture or that deny freedom of expression and human rights should bear in mind that they will find it increasingly hard to escape the judgement of their own people or where warranted the reach of international law we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home americans admire a people who can scratch a desert and produce a garden the israelis have shown qualities that americans identify with guts patriotism idealism a passion for freedom i have seen it i know i believe that any nation that thinks more of its ease and comfort than its freedom will soon lose its freedom and the ironical thing about it is that it will lose its ease and comfort too i begin to feel like most americans dont understand the first amendment dont understand the idea of freedom of speech and dont understand that its the responsibility of the citizen to speak out the secret to happiness is freedom and the secret to freedom is courage liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security the intense happiness of our union is derived in a high degree from the perfect freedom with which we each follow and declare our own impressions human beings the world over need freedom and security that they may be able to realize their full potential i stand for freedom of expression doing what you believe in and going after your dreams i come bearing an olive branch in one hand and the freedom fighters gun in the other do not let the olive branch fall from my hand who is more to be pitied a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say personal identity seems like its just such an american archetype from holly golightly reinventing herself in breakfast at tiffanys to jay gatsby in the great gatsby it seems like the sort of archetypal american issue if youre given the freedom to be anything or be anyone what do you do with it satisfaction consists in freedom from pain which is the positive element of life a just laicism allows religious freedom the state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society as soon as laws are necessary for men they are no longer fit for freedom power in defense of freedom is greater than power in behalf of tyranny and oppression one of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians but the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources like artists because art and music allow people a certain freedom no protracted war can fail to endanger the freedom of a democratic country i keep telling myself to calm down to take less of an interest in things and not to get so excited but i still care a lot about liberty freedom of speech and expression and fairness in journalism the success i have achieved in bodybuilding motion pictures and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the american people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams we are willing enough to praise freedom when she is safely tucked away in the past and cannot be a nuisance in the present amidst dangers whose outcome we cannot foresee we get nervous about her and admit censorship we have convinced over one billion members of the islamic faith that we are prejudiced against their religion that we would deny them freedom of religion that we want suppress their culture and invade their governments 137 years later memorial day remains one of americas most cherished patriotic observances the spirit of this day has not changed  it remains a day to honor those who died defending our freedom and democracy freedom does not come without a price we may sometimes take for granted the many liberties we enjoy in america but they have all been earned through the ultimate sacrifice paid by so many of the members of our armed forces to become selfaware people must be allowed to hear a plurality of opinions and then make up their own minds they must be allowed to say write and publish whatever they want freedom of expression is the most basic but fundamental right without it human beings are reduced to automatons freedom is a right ultimately defended by the sacrifice of americas servicemen and women there are days when solitude is a heady wine that intoxicates you with freedom others when it is a bitter tonic and still others when it is a poison that makes you beat your head against the wall i had crossed the line i was free but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom i was a stranger in a strange land no amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses a buddha is someone who finds freedom in good fortune and bad before anything else we need a new age of enlightenment our present political systems must relinquish their claims on truth justice and freedom and have to replace them with the search for truth justice freedom and reason the course of this conflict is not known yet its outcome is certain freedom and fear justice and cruelty have always been at war and we know that god is not neutral between them my desire to curtail undue freedom of speech extends only to such public areas as restaurants airports streets hotel lobbies parks and department stores verbal exchanges between consenting adults in private are as of little interest to me as they probably are to them the hope and change the democrats had in mind was nothing more than a retread of the failed and discredited socialist policies that have been the enemy of freedom for centuries all over the world i fear america is teetering towards tyranny i am a lover of truth a worshipper of freedom a celebrant at the altar of language and purity and tolerance a state that suppresses all freedom of speech and which by imposing the most terrible punishments treats each and every attempt at criticism however morally justified and every suggestion for improvement as plotting to high treason is a state that breaks an unwritten law unnecessary possessions are unnecessary burdens if you have them you have to take care of them there is great freedom in simplicity of living it is those who have enough but not too much who are the happiest so long as you do not achieve social liberty whatever freedom is provided by the law is of no avail to you you measure a democracy by the freedom it gives its dissidents not the freedom it gives its assimilated conformists freedom and order are not incompatible truth is strength free discussion is the very life of truth in my youth i stressed freedom and in my old age i stress order i have made the great discovery that liberty is a product of order americas greatness has been the greatness of a free people who shared certain moral commitments freedom without moral commitment is aimless and promptly selfdestructive america is a model of force and freedom and moderation  with all the coarseness and rudeness of its people the wisest use of american strength is to advance freedom freedom would be not to choose between black and white but to abjure such prescribed choices punk has always been about doing things your own way what it represents for me is ultimate freedom and a sense of individuality i love music its freedom a way to deal with pentup frustration for us democracy is a question of human dignity and human dignity is political freedom only people who have been allowed to practise freedom can have the grownup look in their eyes the united nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members no slavery can be abolished without a double emancipation and the master will benefit by freedom more than the freedman the only freedom i care about is the freedom to do right the freedom to do wrong i am ready to part with on the cheapest terms to anyone who will take it of me justice is never given it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final fact but a continuing evolving process to higher and higher levels of human social economic political and religious relationship while the state exists there can be no freedom when there is freedom there will be no state even before i knew i was gay i knew i didnt want to have a child i knew i didnt want to have one i never want to have to release it from me listen i love babies i love children and i melt when im around them i also love my freedom and i love that i can sleep at night fiction is such a world of freedom its wonderful if you want someone to fly they can fly if one more journalist makes a cavalier statement about me and my band i will personally or with my fans help greet them at their home and discover just how much they believe in their freedom of speech we will not be intimidated or pushed off the world stage by people who do not like what we stand for and that is freedom democracy and the fight against disease poverty and terrorism just living is not enough one must have sunshine freedom and a little flower the freedom to fail is vital if youre going to succeed most successful people fail from time to time and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success i believe that god has planted in every heart the desire to live in freedom american and israel share a special bond our relationship is unique among all nations like america israel is a strong democracy a symbol of freedom and an oasis of liberty a home to the oppressed and persecuted all people hope islam helps everything in life islam will make jobs islam will make freedom islam will make everything there are two good things in life  freedom of thought and freedom of action as we look forward to freedom the shining city on the hill and the best days of america lying ahead it is the men and women in uniform who protect defend and make us proud to whom we should look and give thanks every night to be able to love and live in freedom means to be able to make godly decisions to make godly decisions we have to surrender our egos and all the falsity and shame that goes with it the momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable  and it is not carried forward by our power alone we can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years and in all that is to come we can know that his purposes are just and true freedom of speech freedom of the press and freedom of religion all have a double aspect  freedom of thought and freedom of action anywhere anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose the choice is the same freedom not tyranny democracy not dictatorship the rule of law not the rule of the secret police much literary criticism comes from people for whom extreme specialization is a cover for either grave cerebral inadequacy or terminal laziness the latter being a much cherished aspect of academic freedom you cant put democracy and freedom back into a box how does the meadow flower its bloom unfold because the lovely little flower is free down to its root and in that freedom bold freedom of speech is always under attack by fascist mentality which exists in all parts of the world unfortunately racism is a refuge for the ignorant it seeks to divide and to destroy it is the enemy of freedom and deserves to be met headon and stamped out struggle is a never ending process freedom is never really won you earn it and win it in every generation education is a human right with immense power to transform on its foundation rest the cornerstones of freedom democracy and sustainable human development true freedom is where an individuals thoughts and actions are in alignment with that which is true correct and of honor  no matter the personal price to enjoy freedom we have to control ourselves men who want to support women in our struggle for freedom and justice should understand that it is not terrifically important to us that they learn to cry it is important to us that they stop the crimes of violence against us novelists have always had complete freedom to pretty much tell their story any way they saw fit and thats what im trying to do our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the hebrew prophets america and israel have a common love of human freedom and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life a political prisoner is someone who is out fighting for his or her peoples rights and freedom and is imprisoned for that alone todays constitution is a realistic document of freedom only because of several corrective amendments those amendments speak to a sense of decency and fairness that i and other blacks cherish true independence and freedom can only exist in doing whats right i am conservative with a small c its possible to be conservative in fiscal policy and tolerant on moral issues or questions of freedom of expression freedom granted only when it is known beforehand that its effects will be beneficial is not freedom analysis gave me great freedom of emotions and fantastic confidence i felt i had served my time as a puppet in south africa we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world who through the use of nonviolent means such as boycotts and divestment encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decadeslong support for the apartheid regime pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as ends look freedom is an overwhelming american notion the idea that we want to see the world the peoples of the world free is something that all of us subscribe to we must face the fact that the preservation of individual freedom is incompatible with a full satisfaction of our views of distributive justice thought takes man out of servitude into freedom art gives me the freedom i dont have when i make music for all who love freedom and peace the world without saddam husseins regime is a better and safer place the terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear  and they should be afraid because freedom is on the march the road to freedom lies not through mysteries or occult performances but through the intelligent use of natural forces and laws the price of freedom is eternal vigilance freedom is not enough freedom and democracy are dreams you never give up all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues freedom people demand freedom only when they have no power freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one let a new earth rise let another world be born let a bloody peace be written in the sky let a second generation full of courage issue forth let a people loving freedom come to growth the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins the killers will fail and the iraqi people will live in freedom i do not want art for a few any more than education for a few or freedom for a few i am truly free only when all human beings men and women are equally free the freedom of other men far from negating or limiting my freedom is on the contrary its necessary premise and confirmation death is the liberator of him whom freedom cannot release the physician of him whom medicine cannot cure and the comforter of him whom time cannot console bondage is of the mind freedom too is of the mind if you say i am a free soul i am a son of god who can bind me free you shall be those religions that are oppressive to women are also against democracy human rights and freedom of expression real freedom lies in wildness not in civilization the fifth freedom is freedom from ignorance the liberals think government exists to fix whats wrong with america they find fault with our constitution our economic model and our core values we disagree with the premise of their argument we believe theres nothing wrong with america that an extra dose of freedom wont cure freedom of expression  in particular freedom of the press  guarantees popular participation in the decisions and actions of government and popular participation is the essence of our democracy men are freest when they are most unconscious of freedom the shout is a rattling of chains always was it is capitalist america that produced the modern independent woman never in history have women had more freedom of choice in regard to dress behavior career and sexual orientation that freedom can never be attained by a nation without suffering and sacrifice has been amply borne out by the recent tragic happenings in this subcontinent exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity freedom is control in your own life i was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom they have the gratification of intense interest the authorities want to put them in jail while there are younger readers for whom what they write is pure oxygen i have no choice about whether or not i have parkinsons i have nothing but choices about how i react to it in those choices theres freedom to do a lot of things in areas that i wouldnt have otherwise found myself in we cant equate democracy with christianity because the largest democracy on earth is india which is primarily hindu the third largest democracy is indonesia which is islamic democracy and freedom are not dependent on christian beliefs none can love freedom heartily but good men the rest love not freedom but licence freedom can occur only through education fashion is an imposition a reign on freedom economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence and what do democrats stand for if they are so ready to defame concerned citizens as the mob  a word betraying a marie antoinette delusion of superiority to ordinary mortals i thought my party was populist attentive to the needs and wishes of those outside the power structure and as a product of the 1960s i thought the democratic party was passionately committed to freedom of thought and speech it is better to lose everything you have to keep the balance of justice level than to live a life of petty privilege devoid of true freedom a new breeze is blowing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn for in mans heart if not in fact the day of the dictator is over the totalitarian era is passing its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree art is the daughter of freedom young players need freedom of expression to develop as creative players they should be encouraged to try skills without fear of failure the perfection of our union especially our commitment to equality of opportunity has been a story of constant striving to live up to our founding principles this is what abraham lincoln meant when he said in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free  honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve thats what we do in this country thats the american dream thats freedom and ill take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners i dont like definitions but if there is a definition of freedom it would be when you have control over your reality to transform it to change it rather than having it imposed upon you you cant really ask for more than god tolerates even our stammering and pardons our ignorance whenever something inadvertently escapes us  as indeed without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray a nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten when youre not concerned with succeeding you can work with complete freedom secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of watching president obama apologize last week for americas arrogance  before a french audience that owes its freedom to the sacrifices of americans  helped convince me that he has a deepseated antipathy toward american values and traditions art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith faith and freedom if the events of september 11 2001 have proven anything its that the terrorists can attack us but they cant take away what makes us american  our freedom our liberty our civil rights no only attorney general john ashcroft can do that our culture is just a series of checks and balances the whole idea that were in a battle between tyranny and freedom  its a series of pendulum swings but if you can create an honorable livelihood where you take your skills and use them and you earn a living from it it gives you a sense of freedom and allows you to balance your life the way you want but i dont think any arranger should ever write a drum part for a drummer because if a drummer cant create his own interpretation of the chart and he plays everything thats written he becomes mechanical he has no freedom the degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of concentration on a single thought are the measures to gauge spiritual progress freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently back then i didnt think a woman like that or a relationship like that could exist with complete freedom and no jealousy or possessiveness i thought it sounded too good to be true and i was certainly convinced it wasnt the life for me i think this society suffers so much from too much freedom too many rights that allow people to be irresponsible but i found that disappointing people is a good thing because disapproval is freedom it is easy to believe in freedom of speech for those with whom we agree america to me is freedom the new freedom of expression brought by the internet goes far beyond politics people relate to each other in new ways posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception the man form is higher than the angel form of all forms it is the highest man is the highest being in creation because he aspires to freedom what is the conservative movement its pretty straightforward we believe that the way prosperity is created is when people have the freedom and the opportunity to pursue their dreams many politicians are in the habit of laying it down as a selfevident proposition that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom the maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim heres a nation one of the founding pillars was freedom of speech and freedom of expression and yet we have imposed upon people restrictions on what they can say on what they can think and the media is the largest proponent of this crucifying people who say things really quite innocently you cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom the history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be freedom is fragile and must be protected to sacrifice it even as a temporary measure is to betray it no one can enjoy freedom without trembling im not sure if its good to have freedom or not im really confused now freedom is not a gift nor does it simply exist for us to have but rather it is a sacred duty and its blessed yield of hope is born from none other than the blood of the innocent obedience is detachment from the self this is the most radical detachment of all but what is the self the self is the principle of reason and responsibility in us it is the root of freedom it is what makes us men what is the essence of america finding and maintaining that perfect delicate balance between freedom to and freedom from the precondition to freedom is security the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation ive used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the united states as effectively as possible and secondly ive still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth but on average i go to the gym about four or five times a week today im so experienced in training  im actually listening to my body now my body needs freedom when i train i create serenity and i produce oxygen in my blood it helps me to think better and relax by training you accentuate the problem we dont appreciate what we have until its gone freedom is like that its like air when you have it you dont notice it there should be a sympathy with freedom a desire to give it scope founded not upon visionary ideas but upon the long experience of many generations within the shores of this happy isle that in freedom you lay the firmest foundations both of loyalty and order a mere forty years ago beach volleyball was just beginning no bureaucrat would have invented it and thats what freedom is all about no cause is left but the most ancient of all the one in fact that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics the cause of freedom versus tyranny victorious living does not mean freedom from temptation nor does it mean freedom from mistakes to me freedom entitles you to do something not to not do something a person is a fool to become a writer his only compensation is absolute freedom and why do we who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech allow people to go to prison and be vilified and magazines to be closed down on the spot for suggesting another version of history the jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world across the centuries passover has never lost its power to inspire the imagination of successive generations of jews with its annually reenacted drama of slavery and liberation dont ever dare to take your college as a matter of course  because like democracy and freedom many people youll never know have broken their hearts to get it for you the freedom to be an individual is the essence of america as a consequence of the victories we have registered during our first ten years of freedom we have laid a firm foundation for the new advances we must and will make during the next decade ive returned to being an amateur without any ties or strings attached which gives me a freedom i never had before in many respects the united states is a great country freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country it is also a very free society working with hbo was an opportunity to experience creative freedom and longform development that filmmakers didnt have a chance to do before the emergence of shows like the sopranos freedom morality and the human dignity of the individual consists precisely in this that he does good not because he is forced to do so but because he freely conceives it wants it and loves it in a completely sane world madness is the only freedom i felt extremely uncomfortable as the focal point in the spotlight i really like the behind the scenes role because all my freedom is there the general interest of the masses might take the place of the insight of genius if it were allowed freedom of action when we talk of freedom and opportunity for all nations the mocking paradoxes in our own society become so clear they can no longer be ignored for you who no longer posses it freedom is everything for us who do it is merely an illusion negation is the minds first freedom yet a negative habit is fruitful only so long as we exert ourselves to overcome it adapt it to our needs once acquired it can imprison us we chose more freedom instead of more government we chose the principles of our founding to solve the challenges of our time we chose a special man to lead us in a special time we chose mitt romney to lead our nation i think theres some connection between absolute discipline and absolute freedom in 1960 when i came out of prison as an exconvict i had more freedom under parolee supervision than theres available in america right now it is very easy to make clear what you want a film to say but i did not wish to engage in overt propaganda even for the right cause i wanted to create an experience through the films something where people could have the freedom of their own response to them among the many values in life i appreciate freedom most it is clear that not in one thing alone but in many ways equality and freedom of speech are a good thing and its one thing to give people freedom and something else to deny the rights of christians to assert their faith in order to keep hindus from feeling upset the day will dawn when all the people of ireland will have the desire for freedom to show it is then well see the rising of the moon not to sound overly cheesy but i really appreciate the freedom we have in america  especially as a female the political core of any movement for freedom in the society has to have the political imperative to protect free speech among the best traitors ireland has ever had mother church ranks at the very top a massive obstacle in the path to equality and freedom she has been a force for conservatism to ward off threats to her own security and influence it requires greater courage to preserve inner freedom to move on in ones inward journey into new realms than to stand defiantly for outer freedom it is often easier to play the martyr as it is to be rash in battle no people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies we are living in the excesses of freedom just take a look at 42nd street and broadway civilization is the order and freedom is promoting cultural activity every therapeutic cure and still more any awkward attempt to show the patient the truth tears him from the cradle of his freedom from responsibility and must therefore reckon with the most vehement resistance in health there is freedom health is the first of all liberties old age calm expanded broad with the haughty breadth of the universe old age flowing free with the delicious nearby freedom of death once i know people know who i am it gives me a lot of licence and freedom to behave in ways i wouldnt normally but it wasnt until i graduated from texas a amp m university and joined the united states air force flying c130s all around the globe that i truly appreciated the blessings of freedom im not a drug addict my wild period wasnt about drugs it was about sexual freedom the state is the altar of political freedom and like the religious altar it is maintained for the purpose of human sacrifice as long as there is rape there is not going to be any peace or justice or equality or freedom you are not going to become what you want to become or who you want to become you are not going to live in the world you want to live in theres a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling youre selfpropelled and decide exactly where to go if you see something that catches your eye to the left you can veer off there which isnt so easy in a car and you cant cover as much ground walking the magic of america is that were a free and open society with a mixed population part of our security is our freedom the idea that men are created free and equal is both true and misleading men are created different they lose their social freedom and their individual autonomy in seeking to become like each other it was so much fun to have the freedom to wander america with no assignments for 25 or 30 years i never had an assignment these were all stories i wanted to do myself freedom cannot be given it can only be taken away i had spent many years pursuing excellence because that is what classical music is all about now it was dedicated to freedom and that was far more important there are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about god and religion but does anybody really know for sure thats why the founding fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves true freedom requires the rule of law and justice and a judicial system in which the rights of some are not secured by the denial of rights to others but if people want to swim in the thames if they want to take their lives into their own hands then they should be able to do so with all the freedom and exhilaration of our woadpainted ancestors we in the united states should be all the more thankful for the freedom and religious tolerance we enjoy and we should always remember the lessons learned from the holocaust in hopes we stay vigilant against such inhumanity now and in the future a nice easy place for freedom of speech to be eroded is comics because comics are a natural target whenever an election comes up the current total of countries in the world with first amendments is one you have guaranteed freedom of speech other countries dont have that we know there is no such thing as freedom without the risk of failure fortunately somewhere between chance and mystery lies imagination the only thing that protects our freedom despite the fact that people keep trying to reduce it or kill it off altogether we need the children of indonesia and the philippines to manufacture our freedom of choice and we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves when we have a government that honors our constitution and stands up for the values that have made america america economic freedom individual liberty and personal responsibility hamas is a terrorist organization dedicated to annihilating the jewish state it runs a theocratic totalitarian state in gaza with no individual liberty and no freedom of speech or press we know what works freedom works we know whats right freedom is right to me the american dream is being able to follow your own personal calling to be able to do what you want to do is incredible freedom i can remember when democrats believed that it was the duty of america to fight for freedom over tyranny the cause of freedom is not the cause of a race or a sect a party or a classit is the cause of human kind the very birthright of humanity we call our country home of the brave and land of the free but its not we give a false portrayal of freedom were not free  if we were wed allow people their freedom the clash of ideas is the sound of freedom a lot of people out there pay good lip service to the idea of personal freedom right up to the point that someone tries to do something that they dont personally approve of the ego is partly free partly determined and reaches fuller freedom by approaching the individual who is most free god man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity true human goodness in all its purity and freedom can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power heroworship is strongest where there is least regard for human freedom america is just the country that how all the written guarantees in the world for freedom are no protection against tyranny and oppression of the worst kind there the politician has come to be looked upon as the very scum of society what we have at present is a system of loss socialism whatever goes wrong is shouldered by the general public and anything that works is privatised worshippers of market freedom have suspended the most important economic principle risk and liability go hand in hand in the literal sense there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from africa but there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights justice and freedom  along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society political freedom without economic equality is a pretense a fraud a lie and the workers want no lying what churchill described as the twin marauders of war and tyranny have been almost entirely banished from our continent today hundreds of millions dwell in freedom from the baltic to the adriatic from the western approaches to the aegean today hundreds of millions dwell in freedom from the baltic to the adriatic from the western approaches to the aegean and while we must never take this for granted the first purpose of the european union  to secure peace  has been achieved and we should pay tribute to all those in the eu alongside nato who made that happen the enemies of freedom do not argue they shout and they shoot it is the people who scream the loudest about america and freedom who see to be the most intolerant for a differing point of view to me punk rock is the freedom to create freedom to be successful freedom to not be successful freedom to be who you are its freedom so sometimes the facts are good and sometimes the facts are bad the important thing from the point of view of a principle as broad and important as freedom of speech is that the courts articulate and set forth in a very protective way what those principles are i love to deer hunt and fish and drive down the back roads in my truck all those things basically equal freedom to me  and not having to return that message or call from my record company or management at some point i need to recharge institutions  government churches industries and the like  have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail on the whole to perform this function they are wrong and need reconstruction freedom is such a gift it is not the simple statement of facts that ushers in freedom it is the constant repetition of them that has this liberating effect tolerance is the result not of enlightenment but of boredom the american dream is about freedom freedom is secured every day by our men and women in uniform we must build a future worthy of their sacrifice the greatest enemy of individual freedom is the individual himself i try to give the media as many confusing images as i can to retain my freedom whats real is for my children and the people i live with one of the rewards of success is freedom the ability to do whatever you like ruin is the destination toward which all men rush each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons freedom in a commons brings ruin to all freedom is the emancipation from the arbitrary rule of other men the freedom to criticize judges and other public officials is necessary to a vibrant democracy the problem comes when healthy criticism is replaced with more destructive intimidation and sanctions i love the freedom of movement that my phone gives me that has definitely transformed my life until you have lost your reputation you never realize what a burden it was or what freedom really is it is exactly because we are a city that embraces freedom that welcomes everyone and encourages their dreams that new york remains on the front lines in the war on terror ironically it is exactly because we are a city that embraces freedom that welcomes everyone and encourages their dreams that new york remains on the front lines in the war on terror i do think there are certain times we should infringe on your freedom to be honest ive always had far too much freedom i had a job when i was 10 i started living on my own when i was 17 or 18 ive earned my own money ive traveled the world what would i rebel against im a multidimensional person and thats the freedom of fashion that youre able to reinvent yourself through how you dress and how you cut your hair or whatever no one who has lived even for a fleeting moment for something other than life in its conventional sense and has experienced the exaltation that this feeling produces can then renounce his new freedom so easily remove advertising disable a person or firm from proclaiming its wares and their merits and the whole of society and of the economy is transformed the enemies of advertising are the enemies of freedom most men after a little freedom have preferred authority with the consoling assurances and the economy of effort it brings so the comic book legal defense fund is out there preserving and fighting for and sometimes winning and sometimes losing the fight for first amendment rights in comics and more generally for freedom of speech theres a glorious sense of freedom in comedy just allowing myself to tell jokes allowing myself to interrupt myself and tell old african folk stories that i made up  or didnt  and jamaican stories the worst enemy of truth and freedom in our society is the compact majority the pillars of truth and the pillars of freedom  they are the pillars of society our forefathers got it they got it man they took godly principles and they put them into action and they developed our constitution  the land of freedom where each man is accountable and responsible for his actions the first amendment freedom of religion is as important today as when the bill of rights was first written one certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression certain things happened in the early church women who had never had any freedom suddenly have the ability to stand up and speak and be treated as equals within the life of the church their poverty secured their freedom since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism the only thing money gives you is the freedom of not worrying about money when a truth is not given complete freedom freedom is not complete human beings want to be free and however long they may agree to stay locked up to stay oppressed there will come a time when they say thats it suddenly they find themselves doing something that they never would have thought they would be doing simply because of the human instinct that makes them turn their face towards freedom we hold our heads high despite the price we have paid because freedom is priceless freedom begins as we become conscious of it the problem of the world today is the people talk on and on about democracy freedom justice but i dont give a damn about democracy if i am worried about survival there must be freedom for all to live to think to worship no book no avenue must be closed freedom is the byproduct of economic surplus while democrats fussed with the details of health care reforms conservatives spent months telling the nation that the real issue is freedom that whats on the line is american liberty itself there are few things in politics more annoying than the rights utter conviction that it owns the patent on the word freedom that when its leaders stand up for the rights of banks to be unregulated or capital gains to be untaxed that it is actually and obviously standing up for human liberty the noblest cause of them all women are degraded by the propensity to enjoy the present moment and at last despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain the condition every art requires is not so much freedom from restriction as freedom from adulteration and from the intrusion of foreign matter if you are for freedom and equal rights which we hear a lot of talk about these days then you have to include the lgbtq community in that and if youre not willing to put your time where your mouth is then i dont know quite what you mean by commitment in your life the united states and israel have a unique relationship based on our mutual commitment to democracy freedom and peace therefore just as our commitment to these principles must be steadfast so must our support for israel bush is morally a universalist for instance he says the freedom is good the same thing is good all over the world so in that sense hes a universalist bush sees the evil as out there in the wider world residing in people who hate freedom look at his immediate response to the pictures of prisoner abuse this is not what americans do these are not our values freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism i really feel that the talent i have is acting freedom and the possibility of playthat is what i like to have in the beginning i loved being famous but now i am tired of it and i would like to go back to my freedom the bill of rights was intended to secure freedom of speech  the freedom of speech of members of parliament to speak freely rather than be at threat of the threat of an over powerful monarch at the time i will never understand people who think that the way to show their righteous opposition to sexual freedom is to write letters full of filthy words well the first thing is that truth and power for me form an antithesis an antagonism which will hardly ever be resolved i can define in fact can simplify the history of human society the evolution of human society as a contest between power and freedom my grandfather was a man when he talked about freedom his attitude was really interesting his view was that you had obligations or you had responsibilities and when you fulfilled those obligations or responsibilities that then gave you the liberty to do other things too much freedom can lead to the souls decay freedom has a price most people arent willing to pay it great research universities must insist on independence from government and on the exercise of academic freedom i was determined to achieve the total freedom that our history lessons taught us we were entitled to no matter what the sacrifice modernism released us from the constraints of everything that had gone before with a euphoric sense of freedom resist this war on god freedom of religion and freedom of speech ive come to realize that protecting freedom of choice in our everyday lives is essential to maintaining a healthy civil society to criticize a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous but to criticize their religion that is a right that is a freedom for the past several years i have remained what others would consider underground i did this in order to build a community of people likeminded in their desire for freedom and the right to pursue their goals and lives without being manipulated and controlled by a media protected military industrial complex with a completely different agenda as crucial as religion has been and is to the life of the nation americas unifying force has never been a specific faith but a commitment to freedom  not least freedom of conscience the spread of freedom is the best security for the free but there is a corollary to freedom and thats personal responsibility and the real challenge is how you generate that personal responsibility without imposing it it is a strange fact that freedom and equality the two basic ideas of democracy are to some extent contradictory logically considered freedom and equality are mutually exclusive just as society and the individual are mutually exclusive my wife needs her freedom just like me you have the freedom to live and let live to love and let love granting yourself that freedom is one of the healthiest most constructive things you can do for yourself and the people who matter to you beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance this great land of ordered liberty for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin the declaration of independence was always our vision of who we wanted to be our ideal of freedom and justice how we were going to be different and what the american experiment was going to be about her beauty didnt do her any good and she couldnt use it in any positive way or manipulative way i just hope that people will look and see and believe in that hope of love that hope of freedom even if it was just for a limited time the spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom  these are the pillars of society if our freedom is taken the american dream will wither and die now one of the most essential branches of english liberty is the freedom of ones house the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact no my work does not reflect my sexual preferences it reflects the fact that i feel total freedom as an artist i like repressed characters that gives me a lot of freedom to make a lot of different choices through subtleties the work of art is a scream of freedom as the fly bangs against the window attempting freedom while the door stands open so we bang against death ignoring heaven freedom of choice is more to be treasured than any possession earth can give you have riches and freedom here but i feel no sense of faith or direction you have so many computers why dont you use them in the search for love the hope of the nation which throughout the nineteenth century had not for a moment reconciled itself with the loss of independence and fighting for its own freedom fought at the same time for the freedom of other nations i most sincerely wish that the world in which we live be free from the threat of a nuclear holocaust and from the ruinous arms race it is my cherished desire that peace be not separated from freedom which is the right of every nation this i desire and for this i pray freedom must be gained step by step slowly freedom is a food which must be carefully administered when people are too hungry for it freedom is an indivisible word if we want to enjoy it and fight for it we must be prepared to extend it to everyone whether they are rich or poor whether they agree with us or not no matter what their race or the color of their skin freedom requires no effort to enjoy but requires heroic efforts to preserve ive got personal views on the 60s you cant have freedom without paying the price for it we clearly realize that freedoms inner kingdom cannot be touched by exterior attacks if one is going to err one should err on the side of liberty and freedom americas veterans have served their country with the belief that democracy and freedom are ideals to be upheld around the world music is where i have the most creative freedom but i love producing to me thats kind of where all the action is you get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film from picking a director sometimes picking a writer to the actors the wardrobe set design editing music and marketing jobs mean freedom for workers to support their families many will view the compromises that will be made during your negotiations as painful concessions but why not view them as peace offerings ones that will provide in return the priceless gifts of hope security and freedom for our children and our childrens rock and roll music  the music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner of conservative defense mechanisms freedom is mans capacity to take a hand in his own development it is our capacity to mold ourselves human freedom involves our capacity to pause to choose the one response toward which we wish to throw our weight you can be a thousand different women its your choice which one you want to be its about freedom and sovereignty you celebrate who you are you say this is my kingdom israel was born under the british mandate we learned from the british what democracy means and how it behaves in a time of danger war and terror we thank britain for introducing freedom and respect of human rights both in normal and demanding circumstances when the united states was founded the very idea of a nation premised on democratic principles of freedom and tolerance was viewed by the vast majority of the world as an experiment doomed to fail dictatorships monarchies and theocracies had for many centuries ruled the world if you dont mind haunting the margins i think there is more freedom there we know from our own history that democratic institutions take decades to mature and we know from past conflicts that freedom is not free if its total freedom i guess the ultimate thing you can go into is total silence between the audience and performer with the performer projecting something he doesnt even have to play we know the road to freedom has always been stalked by death freedom from care and anxiety of mind is a blessing which i apprehend such people enjoy in higher perfection than most others and is of the utmost consequence we all have the right of freedom of speech under the first amendment we all dont have to agree with one another on our opinions everyone in my circle that i run around with we all feel the same about god country integrity and character next in importance to freedom and justice is popular education without which neither freedom nor justice can be permanently maintained an almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions they seem to sense that gold and economic freedom are inseparable any one who wants to live in peace and freedom will be to live by toil demonstration of high levels of discipline and tolerance for one another laying tracks gives you freedom without being too obvious woe to that nation whose literature is cut short by the intrusion of force this is not merely interference with freedom of the press but the sealing up of a nations heart the excision of its memory bastard freedom waves her fustian flag in mockery over slaves i think to be  for me to be an american is  you know its one of the greatest things in the world for  you know for me just because ive been able to grow up with everything the freedom you know in my eyes this is the greatest country in the world we dont have an official secrets act in the united states as other countries do under the first amendment freedom of the press freedom of speech and freedom of association are more important than protecting secrets those who write the editorials and those who write the columns they simply are unaccountable theyre free to impose their cultural politics in the name of freedom of the press i believe firmly that in making ethical decisions man has the prerogative of true freedom of choice true freedom is the capacity for acting according to ones true character to be altogether ones self to be selfdetermined and not subject to outside coercion now do i think there has to be shared sacrifice among other nations in the world who want a stable and secure world absolutely there has to be but i dont think that america can ever abdicate its leadership role in the world because of who we are and where weve come from we are the symbol for the world for freedom and liberty it is true you cannot eat freedom and you cannot power machinery with democracy but then neither can political prisoners turn on the light in the cells of a dictatorship one mans blasphemy doesnt override other peoples freespeech rights their freedom to publish freedom of thought we must plan for freedom and not only for security if for no other reason than that only freedom can make security secure because if you lived as i did several years under nazi totalitarianism and then 20 years in communist totalitarianism you would certainly realize how precious freedom is and how easy it is to lose your freedom if this liberal potential is properly channeled we may expect the area of freedom of the united states to increase the problem is to spend up our rate of social invention in the service of the welfare of all the people he who believes in freedom of the will has never loved and never hated anything outside marriage seems like freedom and excitement there are forces all around you who wish to exploit division rob you of your freedom and tell you what to think but young folks can rekindle the weary spirit of a slumbering nation i tasted freedom and i really liked it in the end nature is inexorable it has no reason to hurry and sooner or later it takes what belongs to it unconsciously and inflexibly obedient to its own laws it doesnt know art just as it doesnt know freedom just as it doesnt know goodness freedom is not won by merely overthrowing a tyrannical ruler or an oppressive regime that is usually only the prelude to a new tyranny a new oppression freedom begins with what we teach our children that is why jews became a people whose passion is education whose heroes are teachers and whose citadels are schools the message of passover remains as powerful as ever freedom is won not on the battlefield but in the classroom and the home teach your children the history of freedom if you want them never to lose it what creates freedom a revolution in the streets mass protest civil war a change of government the ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new history more often than not shows that hopes raised by such events are often dashed sooner rather than later the financial reward is great and i love the life i have but all money makes possible is for you to stop worrying about money then you have freedom to live your life when i was teaching in the 1960s in boston there was a great deal of hope in the air martin luther king jr was alive malcolm x was alive great great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement the american experience influenced my understanding of individuality basic human rights freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens take young researchers put them together in virtual seclusion give them an unprecedented degree of freedom and turn up the pressure by fostering competitiveness i learned what i really love is making films not the film business i want to be on the set meeting with writers i want that freedom i love it now never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth you know if you are kind of rich the best thing is that you dont have to think about money the best thing you can buy with money is freedom time i dont know how much i earn a year i have no idea i dont know how much i pay in taxes i think we recognize as americans there are certain things that are just primary to the freedoms and liberties that we enjoy here and religious freedom is one of the most important things we as americans cherish to us americans much has been given of us much is required with all our faults and mistakes it is our strength in support of the freedom our forefathers loved which has saved mankind from subjection to totalitarian power all americans value the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press and i believe this is essential for our continued way of life but with this freedom comes responsibility that responsibility has been abdicated here by some in the media and some in the government ive never understood why people consider youth a time of freedom and joy its probably because they have forgotten their own i like the freedom of podcasting with podcasting you can really mess around with the form and the format you can do as much time as you like without having to pause for commercials i wanted to try to push some freedom into the mens clothes religious tolerance is something we should all practice however there have been more persecution and atrocities committed in the name of religion and religious freedom than anything else a free and truly independent press  fiercely independent when necessary  is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy after the tragedy new yorkers are more united than ever in their vision as well as in appreciation what living in freedom means  and that if we stand together we can accomplish anything roosevelt talked not only about freedom from fear but also freedom from want the greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom but in the last analysis our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves well im a libertarian conservative so i believe in limited governmentmaximum individual freedom all the characters in my films are fighting these problems needing freedom trying to find a way to cut themselves loose but failing to rid themselves of conscience a sense of sin the whole bag of tricks i dont think that artists of any kind would or could sacrifice their artistic freedom by being more responsible with their influence on people especially young people if you can make people understand why freedom is so important through the arts that would be a big help i remain optimistic what weve seen in europe and the rest of the world is that freedom has a much stronger attraction than radical fundamentalism criticism of government finds sanctuary in several portions of the 1st amendment it is part of the right of free speech it embraces freedom of the press so far as discipline is concerned freedom means not its absence but the use of higher and more rational forms as contrasted with those that are lower or less rational every general increase of freedom is accompanied by some degeneracy attributable to the same causes as the freedom giving up even an ounce of precious freedom is a very serious thing to do but short films are not inferior just different i think the short gives a freedom to filmmakers whats appealing is that you dont have as much responsibility for storytelling and plot they can be more like a portrait or a poem they have the ability to take a persons freedom from them on certain situations they have the ability to take a persons reputation and under certain circumstances they have the authority to take a persons life when others stood idly by you and your families gave your all in defence of a risen people and in pursuit of irish freedom and unity i feel like my honesty gives people the freedom to talk about things they wouldnt otherwise my view is that good community management is like having good municipal government you should be able to have dissenting opinions and so on freedom of speech but your grandmother should also be able to walk down the street at night without having to worry about getting mugged i now bid farewell to the country of my birth  of my passions  of my death a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies  whose factions i sought to quell  whose intelligence i prompted to a lofty aim  whose freedom has been my fatal dream peace with the palestinians will open ports of peace all around the mediterranean the duty of leaders is to pursue freedom ceaselessly even in the face of hostility in the face of doubt and disappointment just imagine what could be i call on the iranian people it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious persian heritage a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles how can a nation allow a regime to instill fear take away the peoples freedom and shock the young generation that seeks its way out of the dictatorial iran the middle east is ailing the malady stems from pervasive violence shortages of food water and educational opportunities discrimination against women and  the most virulent cause of all  the absence of freedom my heart goes out to the brave citizens of syria who each day risk and even sacrifice their lives to achieve freedom from a murderous regime we in israel welcome the historic struggle to forge democratic peaceloving governments in our region rosa parks was the queen mother of a movement whose single act of heroism sparked the movement for freedom justice and equality her greatest contribution is that she told us a regular person can make a difference we who officially value freedom of speech above life itself seem to have nothing to talk about but the weather today is a celebration of hope for the iraqi people the iraqi people can now take control of their government and their future by creating a society that protects the rights endowed to us by our creator  life liberty and freedom motorists who want to save money on gas will demand and buy more fuelefficient vehicles we should not limit their freedom with more government regulations more than anything else let me be clear  we need to be willing to fight for freedom and free markets and traditional moral values thats what the american people want to see this movement and this party return to i was intelligent enough to make up my own mind i not only had freedom of choice i had freedom of expression personal technology has given us the freedom of being able to do whatever we want  and in the case of celebrities and athletes whomever they want but it can also serve as a humiliation jetpack the year most of my high school friends and i got our drivers permits the coolest thing one could do was stand outside after school and twirl ones car keys like a lifeguard whistle that jingling sound meant freedom and power i dont believe in firing professors they have academic freedom we believe it wrong ever to take a dollar from a free citizen without a very necessary public purpose because each such taking diminishes the freedom to spend that dollar as its owner would prefer i defend both the freedom of expression and societys right to counter it i must pay the price for differing it is the natural way of things americans are free to choose everything from what they eat drive and watch on tv to the president of the united states yet when it comes to allowing americans to choose the health insurance that works best for them and their family the freedom to choose suddenly becomes unamerican i think the american people have become more reliant upon government and less reliant upon themselves and that they now tend to put security ahead of freedom but i think freedom is the most important aspect of our lives if they want to hang me let them and on the scaffold i will shout freedom for the working class thats why i like fast film it gives you more freedom to light more naturally whatever the immediate gains and losses the dangers to our safety arising from political suppression are always greater than the dangers to the safety resulting from political freedom suppression is always foolish freedom is always wise no i dont believe in genius i believe in freedom i think anyone can do it anyone can be like rembrandt well one thing you got to stand in a courtroom and listen to a judge sentencing you to 25 years in prison before you realize that freedom of expression can no longer be taken for granted it would be too frightening for me to consider myself a role model but i like the idea of not being afraid of letting your imagination rule you to feel the freedom of expression to let creativity be your overwhelming drive rather than other things i have the freedom to do what i want bright people to talk to every day even in the darkest regions people have discovered their right of freedom the search for human freedom can never be complete without freedom for women if you scratch below the surface and ask what really makes me tick its the liberalism of trying to promote freedom and opportunity promoting social mobility is one of the keys to that i dont watch a huge amount of telly i read a lot im reading at the moment freedom by jonathan franzen a great big brick of a book and im loving it i am a passionate believer in freedom of speech i would not support anything which would impinge on aggressive robust freedom of the british press but when things go wrong and there has been outright illegality there should be proper accountability i have more freedom when i write fiction but my memoirs have had a much stronger impact on my readers somehow the message even if i am not even aware that there is one is conveyed better in this form as one gets older one sees many more paths that could be taken artists sense within their own work that kind of swelling of possibilities which may seem a freedom or a confusion the arc of american history almost inevitably moves toward freedom whether its lincoln and the emancipation proclamation the expansion of womens rights or now gay rights i think there is an almostinevitable march toward greater civil liberties i came out of the soviet union no longer a communist because i believed in personal freedom as our federal government has grown too large and too powerful the real loss has been the freedom of people to govern their own lives and participate fully in the american dream i loved the feeling of freedom in running the fresh air the feeling that the only person im competing with is me i wasnt a woman who stayed tiny like i thought i would i definitely gave myself the freedom to eat what i wanted im privileged because i have a lot of freedom i want to use it to make as warm and normal a life as i can for our daughters ive sold my soul for freedom its lonely but its sweet so why am i facing a recall election simple the big government union bosses from washington want their money they dont like the fact that i did something fundamentally proworker something thats truly about freedom they know the importance of their mission and of americas commitment to combating and defeating terrorism abroad and they know that they are making a real difference in bringing freedom to a part of the world that has known only tyranny they have called operation iraqi freedom a war of choice that isnt part of the real war on terror someone should tell that to al qaeda the job of training an iraqi police force is one of the most important tasks being undertaken in operation iraqi freedom it is also one of the most difficult i really care about this stuff i care about movies and you just have to be strong and dont be stupid freedom of choice is a big responsibility and im lucky enough not to have to just take any movie to pay the rent so theres no need to be greedy as a 22year army veteran who served in operations desert storm and iraqi freedom and as a civilian advisor to the afghan army in operation enduring freedom i understand both the gravity of giving the order and the challenge of carrying it out i love the freedom that the narrative form provides freedom is just chaos with better lighting prosperity or egalitarianism  you have to choose i favor freedom  you never achieve real equality anyway you simply sacrifice prosperity for an illusion as a boy i believed freedom for america meant freedom for me there was a time i believed every word spoken recruitment and retention are critical to sustain our armed forces with the best men and women willing to stand in the gap and make huge sacrifices to ensure our freedom i believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience otherwise why go for it i have to change me and i have to learn things and i have to push me and my limits by acting i find a freedom inside of a prison in a way i believe in trying to get a balance between individual freedom on the one hand and social responsibility on the other private property was the original source of freedom it still is its main ballpark theres a freedom to being young that is harder to come by as time goes on i am known for a life spent in the struggle for freedom and freedom includes the freedom of religion i suppose theres a melancholy tone at the back of the american mind a sense of something lost and its the lost world of thomas jefferson it is the lost sense of innocence that we could live with a very minimal state with a vast sense of space in which to work out freedom i needed freedom to really express myself thats really what justified is about not caring more about what other people think than what you think thats freedom the freedom of all is essential to my freedom freedom is not an ideal it is not even a protection if it means nothing more than freedom to stagnate to live without dreams to have no greater aim than a second car and another television set to realize that new world we must prefer the values of freedom and equality above all other values  above personal wealth technical power and nationalism one of the things that bothers me most is the growing belief in the country that security is more important than freedom it aint i believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink it is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty and freedom it is the history of our nation and its marked by the blood of those who died defending it a sense of freedom is something that happily comes with age and life experience in the last analysis our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves you learn that you either are going to have a police state where you dont have any freedom left or youre going to build a world that doesnt create terrorists  and that means a whole different way of getting along the people who are competing businesswise out there want what other successful labels and artists have i dont want what they have i want my own path my own sound my own identity record labels care nothing about identity or artistic freedom they want good business just as the security council was largely irrelevant to the great struggle of the last half of the twentieth century  freedom against communism  so too it is largely on the sidelines in our contemporary struggles against international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction i never abandoned either forms or freedom i imagine that most of what could be called free verse is in my first book i got through that fairly early the nice thing about the bible is it doesnt give you too many facts two an a half lines and it tells you the whole story and that leaves you a great deal of freedom to elaborate on how it might have happened i feel like my work has been my path to freedom from having grown up in a segregated environment the american idea is as promising imaginative and full of the unexpected as the land itself the land represents freedom  the frontier the ability to make a new future with your own bare hands i loved climbing because of the freedom and having time and space i remember coming off everest for the last time thinking of dad and wishing that he could have seen what i saw he would have loved it you cannot mistake bushs clarity of purpose he believes in a story about freedom and opportunity that makes his followers feel like they arent just ticking their days down but are part of something larger than themselves i dont look so closely at womens fashion but from the 20th century on people have had the freedom to express themselves and their individualities and fashion is one of the most fundamental ways in which they do this men and women are equally able to express themselves the people of the middle east share the desire for freedom we have an opportunity  and an obligation  to help them turn this desire into reality the us has since the end of world war ii had an answer  we stand for free peoples and free markets we are willing to support and defend them  we will sustain a balance of power that favors freedom we are expected to believe that anyone who objects to the department of homeland security or the usa patriot act is a terrorist and that the only way to preserve our freedom is to hand it over to the government for safekeeping the freedom of each individual can only be the freedom of all only the freedom of mind can prevent the state from becoming totalitarian and from issuing totalitarian demands it is for each of us freely to choose whom we shall serve and find in that obedience our freedom every dictator is an enemy of freedom an opponent of law thus the struggle for peace includes the struggle for freedom and justice for the masses of all countries they call them terrorists i call them freedom fighters what does it mean to be an american while each of us may have our own specific answer to that question we likely can agree on the basic principles of america freedom equal opportunity and rights accompanied by responsibilities wealth is a tool of freedom but the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery being big and famous doesnt get you more freedom it gets you less your determination selflessness and courage have brought the freedom struggle towards its fulfilment so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidycats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce freedom of religion is a principle that is central to our nations declaration of independence congress has taken this positive step to protect our freedom to express allegiance to americas flag and the ideals it represents i wish we would all remember that being american is not just about the freedom we have it is about those who gave it to us if liberty has any meaning it means freedom to improve in america its live by the sword of freedom of expression and be will to die by it as well thats free enterprise friends freedom to gamble freedom to lose and the great thing  the truly democratic thing about it  is that you dont even have to be a player to lose native americans are the original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the united states they have helped develop the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of powers that form the foundation of the united states government it is crucial that members of congress cast votes that are supportive of the values upon which our nation was founded equality freedom and opportunity for all people ive never let producers tell me what to do even when i was making television i always did what i wanted to do and if i couldnt i didnt do it it was a freedom that these days young directors starting out dont have for us holding on to religious rules and following them and refraining from whats forbidden and being diligent with our duties what do we call that thats what we call freedom private ownership of property is vital to both our freedom and our prosperity liberty freedom and democracy are very fuzzy words but human rights is very specific freedom and responsibility arent interconnected things they are the same thing the communitarians may say youve been enjoying too much individual freedom and that you must give up some of that for the benefit of the community but they really mean that they want more power over your life  to force you to subsidize obey and conform to their choices an open society is a society which allows its members the greatest possible degree of freedom in pursuing their interests compatible with the interests of others my philosophy is dont take no for an answer and be willing to sacrifice your entire project for freedom is walt turning over in his grave a man named joe roth runs disney right nowhe gave me the goahead and total freedom to do whatever i wanted to do none of us had any idea of how successful downton was going to be i thought i was signing up for another period drama that had a slightly modern feel it had a freedom about it because it was coming out of the head of julian fellowes anything could happen and generally did every american deserves to live in freedom to have his or her privacy respected and a chance to go as far as their ability and effort will take them  regardless of race gender ethnicity or economic circumstances responsibility and respect of others and their religious beliefs are also part of freedom if freedoms best friends cannot unify around a realistic actionable program of fundamental change one that attracts and persuades a broad majority of our fellow citizens big change will not come the vietnamese people deeply love independence freedom and peace but in the face of united states aggression they have risen up united as one man freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose real freedom is creative proactive and will take me into new territories i am not free if my freedom is predicated on reacting to my past there is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom produces and that cure is freedom i do believe that freedom isnt free  but today the corporate and political right wing is trying to cheapen this truly american value theyve been cynically using the word freedom to rally the american public against its own best interests i say lets go back to a truer use of the word freedom lets start with president franklin roosevelts four freedoms freedom of speech and expression freedom of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear i would add the freedom to bargain collectively those freedoms are under attack today people should have freedom in their pilgrimages and tours they should come and visit historical monuments and sites  lets say the sites around iran  where they can easily engage in wide scale contacts with others when we are unwilling to draw clear moral lines between free societies and fear societies when we are unwilling to call the former good and the latter evil we will not be able to advance the cause of peace because peace cannot be disconnected from freedom that freedom that picasso afforded himself to be an artist in a huge number of ways seems to be a huge psychological liberation woman must have her freedom the fundamental freedom of choosing whether or not she will be a mother and how many children she will have regardless of what mans attitude may be that problem is hers  and before it can be his it is hers alone the progress of freedom depends more upon the maintenance of peace the spread of commerce and the diffusion of education than upon the labors of cabinets and foreign offices my parents came from russia and suddenly they wound up in boston massachusetts brookline massachusetts and they felt the sun rose and set on franklin delano roosevelts backside because he meant so much to them this was freedom this was something totally different from the russia they had left revolution the people howls and cries freedom thats what were needing weve needed it for centuries our arteries are bleeding the stage is shaking the audience rock the whole thing is over by nine oclock any existence deprived of freedom is a kind of death new ideas should confront old ideas we must refer to the example of europe people have fought to make europe what it is today freedom is not something that is served up on a plate the higher one climbs on the spiritual ladder the more they will grant others their own freedom and give less interference to anothers state of consciousness humanism an exaltation of freedom but one limited by our need to exercise it as an integral part of nature and society i definitely wanted to earn my freedom but the primary motivation wasnt making money but making an impact at 6 years old the ice became a place for me to express myself because i was so shy off the ice it became my safe haven with music and freedom and selfexpression that was my emotional outlet the abortion license has not brought freedom and security to women rather it has ushered in a new era of irresponsibility toward women and children one that now begins before birth i suffered evils but without allowing them to rob me of the freedom to expand but i do believe that a womans truest place is in a home with a husband and with children and with large freedom pecuniary freedom personal freedom and the right to vote dont give me any money dont give me any people but give freedom and ill give you a movie that looks gigantic widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country for more than 60 years anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed chinese art is merely a product it avoids any meaningful engagement there is no larger context its only purpose is to charm viewers with its ambiguity china has not established the rule of law and if there is a power above the law there is no social justice everybody can be subjected to harm im just a citizen my life is equal in value to any other but im thankful that when i lost my freedom so many people shared feelings and put such touching effort into helping me the birds nest national stadium which i helped to conceive is designed to embody the olympic spirit of fair competition it tells people that freedom is possible but needs fairness courage and strength strong generous and confident she has nobly served mankind beware how you trifle with your marvellous inheritance this great land of ordered liberty for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin the freedom now desired by many is not freedom to do and dare but freedom from care and worry patrick henry did not say give me absolutely safety or give me death america is supposed to be about freedom now then in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom i spent a great deal of time with che guevara while i was in havana i believe he was far less a mercenary than he was a freedom fighter theres a hell of a lot of freedom in this rock and roll circus its where all the freaks go  its the environment for me my daughters your daughters our daughters deserve safety protection and the freedom to make their own choices about their personal lives and their physical selves i mean theres enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world  within the eu between china and the united states which way is it going to go its hard to see but in the first gulf war the united kingdom was not under any threat from iraq and is still less so in the second one then there is no justification for obstructing freedom of information particularly as nations have a right to know what their soldiers are being used for it is hard to know how many people do but given that the people are so docile towards the rulers nowadays very few americans show the passion for freedom that our forefathers had the increased presence of muslims in italy and in europe is directly proportional to our loss of freedom freedom means the freedom to behave coarsely basely foolishly government has the role of suiting people for freedom people arent made for freedom spontaneously theres sort of a 19year race between when people are born and when they become adults and government has a role in making them at the end of 19 years suited to be upright trustworthy repositories of popular sovereignty freedom is an internal achievement rather than an external adjustment i started skydiving because i loved the idea of freedom we are all different yet we are all gods children we are all united behind this country and the common cause of freedom justice fairness and equality that is what unites us president bush in his inaugural address talked about bringing freedom to countries that dont have it he didnt specify how to deny the freedom of the will is to make morality impossible all americans and freedomloving people around the world owe president reagan our deepest gratitude for his strong principled leadership that ended the cold war and brought freedom to millions of people theres also a sense of freedom i was so obsessed by this problem that i was thinking about if all the time  when i woke up in the morning when i went to sleep at night and that went on for eight years one of the unsung freedoms that go with a free press is the freedom not to read it value your freedom or you will lose it teaches history dont bother us with politics respond those who dont want to learn free software is software that respects your freedom and the social solidarity of your community so its free as in freedom in the freelibre software movement we develop software that respects users freedom so we and you can escape from software that doesnt if ebooks mean that readers freedom must either increase or decrease we must demand the increase with paper printed books you have certain freedoms you can acquire the book anonymously by paying cash which is the way i always buy books i never use a credit card i dont identify to any database when i buy books amazon takes away that freedom when i launched the development of the gnu system i explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom then its a success its not popularity for our code but its success for our goal i believe dreams represent the purest form of fantasy we unleash through our subconscious they represent the truest freedom we can experience totally unrepressed and totally creative i would say that the war correspondent gets more drinks more girls better pay and greater freedom than the soldier but at this stage of the game having the freedom to choose his spot and being allowed to be a coward and not be executed for it is his torture the freedom of thought is a sacred right of every individual man and diversity will continue to increase with the progress refinement and differentiation of the human intellect thats part of american greatness is discrimination yes sir inequality i think breeds freedom and gives a man opportunity carry out the republican principle of universal suffrage or strike it from your banners and substitute freedom and power to one half of society and submission and slavery to the other freedom is always the freedom of dissenters freedom only for the members of the government only for the members of the party  though they are quite numerous  is no freedom at all all my life americans have been accustomed to thinking of theirs as the richest freest country in the world by most measurements it was long a contender for that honor and  among the larger countries if equal weight were given to wealth and indices of freedom  probably did deserve to be so described when we through our educational culture through the media through the entertainment culture give our children the impression that human beings cannot control their passions we are telling them in effect that human beings cannot be trusted with freedom with courage and character american soldiers continue to put themselves on the line to defend our freedom and so many have paid the ultimate sacrifice they were singing in french but the melody was freedom and any american could understand that our work is a scream of freedom with one man there was a freedom and liberation that was with michael hutchence my partner in life freedom of expression is the matrix the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom american movies and music deliver themes of freedom innocence and power that appeal to others  partly because america itself was put together out of a multiplicity of national traditions our founders warned against this they said dont that your liberty is only as secure as the people are because once they um get the ability to vote themselves entitlements from the largesse of the government liberty is done freedom is over with we were warned we are there judgment traps you within the limitations of your comparisons it inhibits freedom men like me who merely wish to establish political freedom will in such circumstances lose all their influence and others will get influence who may become dangerous to all established interests whatsoever i know that throughout their history the people of the united states defended their freedom their liberty their justice and their rights  if need be  with their lives i think their courage is so admirable the law of god reaches into every area of life and it brings about incredible blessing and incredible freedom i stand for limited government fiscal responsibility personal freedom personal responsibility so the republican party will support me but it required a disastrous internecine war to bring this question of human freedom to a crisis and the process of striking the shackles from the slave was accomplished in a single hour if we want to talk about freedom we must mean freedom for others as well as ourselves and we must mean freedom for everyone inside our frontiers as well as outside having grown up in bombay from the day youre born you have absolute freedom to choose who you want to be it could be my british need for discipline that makes me admire the american appetite for freedom and passion ultimately we know deeply that the other side of every fear is freedom that feeling of freedom open highways of possibilities has kind of been lost to materialism and marketing life is a very orderly thing but in fiction there is a huge liberation and freedom i can do what i like theres nothing that says i cant write a page of full stops there is no should involved although you wouldnt know that from literary reviews and critics republican values  strong families faith personal responsibility and freedom among others  are not unique to specific subsets of the electorate they are universal values and it is republicans job to remind americans of that fact i think there is a heritage which im proud of which is a fight for democracy a fight for social justice a fight for freedom my grandfather went to jail or exile six times in his life fighting for his principles for democracy or for his country and my father twice the legal difference between the sitins and the freedom riders was significant i have always been a firm believer in the longstanding american principle of having the right to bear arms and i will remain committed to see that this freedom is not infringed upon revoked or limited in any way eventually i want to be a fulltime mother who works occasionally  and being an actor you have that freedom many have left their families to defend our freedom we salute their bravery we express our appreciation and support to their families and we pray for their safe return the old romans all wished to have a king over them because they had not yet tasted the sweetness of freedom we believe that salvation is to be found in wholesome work in a beloved land work will provide our people with the bread of tomorrow and moreover with the honor of the tomorrow the freedom of the tomorrow time misspent in youth is sometimes all the freedom one ever has when i was younger i was listening to a lot of armenian music you know revolutionary music about freedom and protest in the 70s i was listening to soul and the bee gees and abba and funk the thing is this you got to have fun while youre fightin for freedom cause you dont always win i dont think that there is absolute freedom of the press we operate under laws  against libel for instance the idea that there is some absolute press freedom is kind of a myth many a time freedom has been rolled back  and always for the same sorry reason fear havin fun while freedom fightin must be one of those lunatic texas traits we get from the water  which is known to have lithium in it  because it goes all the way back to sam houston surely the most lovable the most human and the funniest of all the great men this country has ever produced the freedom to connect to the world anywhere at anytime brings with it the threat of unscrupulous predators and criminals who mask their activities with the anonymity the internet provides to its users yoga is a way to freedom by its constant practice we can free ourselves from fear anguish and loneliness there is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you except that which he gains by kindness and attachment latinos have fought in all of americas wars beginning with the revolutionary war many latinos are fighting and dying for our country today in iraq just as several of their ancestors fought for freedom in mexico over a century ago history is full of examples of people who clamp down after they began to enjoy too much freedom freedom can lead to instability anarchy and confusion so there can be a moral counterrevolution with napster and the sharing of music of course there are going to be people who exploit it greed has no end but theres a lot of good that could happen we shouldnt let the economic concerns of the major labels infringe on our freedom to share music i do have the freedom to choose what i want to do and ill continue to do that jazz is about freedom within discipline usually a dictatorship like in russia and germany will prevent jazz from being played because it just seemed to represent freedom democracy and the united states many people dont understand how disciplined you have to be to play jazz and that is really the idea of democracy  freedom within the constitution or discipline you dont just get out there and do anything you want jazz stands for freedom its supposed to be the voice of freedom get out there and improvise and take chances and dont be a perfectionist  leave that to the classical musicians i was 37 when my father diedand i no longer had any freedom of choice over what i would do with the rest of my life this enemy of peace in the world today is unlike any we have seen in the past and our military is learning from and building on previous successes while carrying peace and freedom into the future i have just enough people paying attention that i have the freedom to be in charge and i have a great record company  nonesuch understands what im about the united states is a giant island of freedom achievement wealth and prosperity in a world hostile to our values maybe a part of me recognized how right the improvising spirit of jazz is not the sounds but the freedom to work with musicians who work that way it felt very natural to me but i think theres a way to do it without it being a jazz record that happens every time i get behind a guitar regardless of what im saying cause music is freedom and being free is the closest ive ever felt to being spiritual you have an absolute freedom in mexican writing today in which you dont necessarily have to deal with the mexican identity you know why because we have an identity we know who we are we know what it means to be a mexican for science must breathe the oxygen of freedom its good that the first half of the speech emphasized freedom because george w bush has been the global champion for freedom as he said if we dont fight tyranny it will not leave us alone in peace a culture without property or in which creators cant get paid is anarchy not freedom the attitude is we live and let live this is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and its an example of freedom from religion i dont have anything to prove anymore i dont have a record deal no one has any expectations im in a position of freedom i dont need anyones approval working with david cronenberg or darren aronofsky or even steven soderbergh isnt really like a typical hollywood movie these are true artists and have a certain amount of freedom when they work and theyre more like independent filmmakers making their way through big studios your life is the sum result of all the choices you make both consciously and unconsciously if you can control the process of choosing you can take control of all aspects of your life you can find the freedom that comes from being in charge of yourself i have always that there ought to be some kind of mandatory national service not necessarily in the military but to show everybody that freedom isnt free that everybody has an obligation to the nation as a community it is not natural or inevitable that half the world goes hungry that the freedom of markets trumps protection of the planet or that citizens rights come second to those of corporations in times such as these people should recognize that evil knows no borders knows no limits and knows no compassion those around the globe that value freedom must continue to persevere even in the darkest of times to her audience janis joplin has remained a symbol artifact and reminder of late sixties youth culture her popularity never derived from her musical ability but from her capacity to link her fantasies of freedom and immortality with ours the enemies of freedom will not prevail in short is not liberty the freedom of every person to make full use of his faculties so long as he does not harm other persons while doing so how can you be conservative and justify wiretapping people without a warrant were supposed to be the party of personal freedom and civil liberties another hero was tom swift in the books what he stood for the freedom the scientific knowledge and being and engineer gave him the ability to invent solutions to problems hes always been a hero to me i buy old tom swift books now and read them to my own children real change isnt found in some new way to think about yourself but in freedom from the need to think about yourself at all its great to have the freedom to enjoy your work and not feel like youre leaving your other life behind i always wanted to make a childrens album because you have the freedom to explore so many wonderful topics and sounds the first of all commodities to be exchanged is labour and the freedom of man consists only in the exercise of the right to determine for himself in what manner his labour shall be employed and how he will dispose of its products you know you dont retreat in the defense of freedom you dont retreat in the defense of moral government and limited government you dont retreat because people are going to defend bad things if governments let themselves be fully bound by the decisions of their parliaments without protecting their own freedom to act a breakup of europe would be a more probable outcome than deeper integration it the british system is the most gigantic system of slavery the world has yet seen and therefore it is that freedom gradually disappears from every country over which england is enabled to obtain control yes we have the freedom to do what we please but it only works because we dont do everything we might please  we should exercise some degree of personal and corporate responsibility freedom of expression comes with responsibilities especially when it comes with serious implications for peace my name became known because i was one might say accidentally the target of state repression and because so many people throughout the country and other parts of the world organized around the demand for my freedom creative freedom is an imperative for me but it doesnt really exist in a hollywood game america has never seen itself as a national state like all others but rather as an experiment in human freedom and democracy i want to have the freedom to do whatever i want money buys many things the best of which is freedom you the foreign media have been the companion of my people in its long and painful journey to freedom you have spent many lives and much treasure to bring freedom to many lands that were reluctant to receive it and here you have a people who won it by themselves and need only the help to preserve it my father described this tall lady who stands in the middle of the new york harbor holding high a torch to welcome people seeking freedom in america i instantly fell in love wherever on this planet ideals of personal freedom and dignity apply there you will find the cultural inheritance of england not to mention the fact that of course terrorists hate freedom i think they do hate but believe me i dont think they sit there abstractly hating freedom people ask how does doing a film compare to doing an ad well when youre doing a commercial you dont have to sell tickets you have a captured audience which is actually completely rare and great it gives you a lot of freedom when you make a film you have to do advertisements for the film i was inspired to write this book by those who are sceptical of the power of freedom to change the world the three main sources of scepticism are first that not every people desires freedom second that democracy in certain parts of the world would be dangerous and third that there is little the worlds democracies can do to advance freedom outside their countries by helping readers understand these mechanics i hope they will appreciate why freedom is for everyone why it is essential for our security and why the free world plays a critically important role in advancing democracy around the globe believe me the drug of freedom is universally potent i am optimistic that peace can be achieved in the region because i believe that every society on earth can be free and that if freedom comes to the middle east there can be peace i take life as it happens and i give myself a lot of freedom i used to think that if i had success i would have freedom but i have less freedom now than ive ever had and what gives me satisfaction is not the jewelry and not the cars what gives me satisfaction is doing things for others like children when i went off to the army when i was 17 years old i believed in america and the rights of freedom but today i believe my government is lying to the american people and that my president george bush is a criminal without freedom of the press there can be no representative government i have a fantastic relationship with money i use it to buy my freedom three simple words  freedom justice and honesty these sum up what the liberal democrats stand for money equals freedom a man of strength and wisdom john paul became an inspiration to generations of both catholics and noncatholics throughout the world by encouraging freedom promoting peace and respecting all faiths as a child i was given the freedom to explore my passion for acting but i also grew up in a home where there were a lot of rules i didnt have yes parents if a jerk burns the flag america is not threatened democracy is not under siege freedom is not at risk i know what youre going to say they are men and men should be free a free man is dangerous to himself and everyone else freedom should be left to those who can put it to good use freedom is a muscle you have to exercise it people want the freedom they want to be able to shop if you dont like the shop trading hours and youre a shop owner you dont have to open a trait which differentiated new york from european cities was the incredible freedom and ease in which life including sexual life could be carried on on many levels school gives you the freedom to explore different philosophies religions aspects of yourself and subjects the humor is essentially dark for a cartoon and sophisticated but at the same time being a cartoon gives the writers more freedom than in a normal sitcom it always pushes the line that despite human failings the simpsons are really decent people we need international support so that our people live a life of normality of dignity of liberty and freedom i hope that our cry for freedom may be heard in terms of filming yes it really does feel over now theres a real sense of freedom now its a good time to finish i think as much as im going to miss it im ready to move on and do different things our soldiers have nobly fought to protect freedom since our countrys birth and have fought to protect those that could not protect themselves even in foreign lands when called upon to stop terrorists before the strike we must do three things deny them entry into the country curtail their freedom of action inside the country and deprive them of material and moral support from within the country i think that we could be more careful about what were saying to young women in terms of their expectations its unrealistic to expect people to always be in designer clothes girls growing up deserve more freedom in how they look and how they feel about how they look i was the youngest child and got a lot more freedom than my brother and sister i used to wander doing my own thing under the radar but i didnt get in bad bad trouble i grew up under communism so we could only learn russian and then when communism fell in 1989 we could learn a few more things and have the freedom to travel and the freedom of speech  and the freedom of dreaming really now we understand much more clearly why people from all over the world want to come to new york and to america its called freedom the balance between freedom and security is a delicate one freedom  an occupied space which must be reoccupied every day spirit borrows from matter the perceptions on which it feeds and restores them to matter in the form of movements which it has stamped with its own freedom we live in a land like no other  a land of freedom and opportunity unparalleled on the face of the globe weve got to understand that the whole nature of the way american democracy guards its freedom has been changed when public access to voting is impaired or when public confidence in voting is diluted democracy suffers and our freedom is less secure if technology has finally caught up with individual liberty why would anyone who loves freedom want to rethink that i am somebody who  im not saying im perfect but i need that freedom that ability to make mistakes out there because theres a fine line between making a mistake or being brilliant i am not an anti to anything which will bring freedom to my class we are a nation in which freedom is alive in the squares and streets in the daily work of the communications media in the open relationship between the governing and the governed if you ask me to summarise our mission i would put it this way we were a military regime that sought to lay the foundations for freedom and liberty in a complex society most importantly nothing has happened to change my conviction that freedom and the love of liberty remain the essential defining attributes of our national character as a people the challenge as we saw in the nigerian project was to restructure the economy decisively in the direction of a modern free market as an appropriate environment for cultivation of freedom and democracy and the natural emergence of a new social order while its really hard to do at the same time im escaping my body which i really want to do im living someone elses life i get very intensely into the story into the interviews and the research im experiencing things along with my subjects i have a freedom i dont have in my physical life ive never had anything but the freedom to do what i wanted just as long as it made me happy fulfill  you can far more than fulfill  the brightest anticipations of those who in the name of human freedom and in the face of threats that have ripened into terrible realities since fought that battle which placed you where you now stand the wretch who lives without freedom feels like dressing in the mud from the streets those who have you o liberty do not know you those who do not have you should not speak of you but win you i like movies that pop that have a little bit of candy on that freedom to have a little bit of extra fun but are rooted in real behaviour rooted in cause and effect never violating reality the media bring our wars home but only rarely have they been able to do it in complete freedom you make a movie for 9k for the freedom it allows you the men and women who serve in our military have won for us every hour we live in freedom sometimes at the expense of the very hours of the lifetimes they had hoped to live freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter mush that would be a mere shadow of freedom the test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order there is a bright spot or two for the spaniards french toast has become freedom toast on the air force one breakfast menu but the spanish omelet is still a spanish omelet when i was in jail i was a lot of peoples favorite person i practically ran the jail i had more freedom than the police a growing number of young women who have the freedom to decide have decided that career can wait and the delicious early years of their childrens lives cant people ask me if i ever thought of writing a childrens book i say if i had a serious brain injury i might well write a childrens book but otherwise the idea of being conscious of who youre directing the story to is anathema to me because in my view fiction is freedom and any restraints on that are intolerable to me music has to be about freedom its the most important thing in my life the very first things that i did even in theater were bad guys they are meaty roles for the most part with the bad guy you have more freedom to experiment and go further out than with a good guy without economic development any potential for political openness and freedom will be questionable our constitutional liberties shall not be sacrificed in our search for greater security for that is what our enemies and all enemies of freedom and democracy hope to achieve the main thing i believe in is freedom we must guard against the overreaching hand of big government trying to take away our freedom and we must always protect the environment in a manner consistent with our values if i am outspoken of the dangers of intemperance to members of our armed forces it is because we are all especially concerned for the welfare of those who are risking their lives in the cause of freedom what is our freedom fight about is it about the liberation of children or just having sex with them although we have in theory abolished human slavery recognized womens rights and stopped child labor we continue to enslave other species who if we simply pay attention show quite clearly that they experience parental love pain and the desire for freedom just as we do men must stop being jealous of their power and generously allow freedom and responsibility to others the reward is harmonious families and society
