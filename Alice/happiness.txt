happiness often sneaks in through a door you didnt know you left open happiness is not something ready made it comes from your own actions most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be i am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation i may find myself for i have learned that the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony some cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go if you want others to be happy practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion a table a chair a bowl of fruit and a violin what else does a man need to be happy the purpose of our lives is to be happy our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits be happy with what you have and are be generous with both and you wont have to hunt for happiness dont wait around for other people to be happy for you any happiness you get youve got to make yourself true happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done the zest of creating things new the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life and that happiness not pain or mindless selfindulgence is the proof of your moral integrity since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values it is not how much we have but how much we enjoy that makes happiness happiness depends upon ourselves happiness doesnt depend on any external conditions it is governed by our mental attitude future that period of time in which our affairs prosper our friends are true and our happiness is assured we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts therefore guard accordingly and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing i know there is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will just do what must be done this may not be happiness but it is greatness there are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one  keep from telling their happiness to the unhappy the first recipe for happiness is avoid too lengthy meditation on the past happiness is not a goal it is a byproduct it is neither wealth nor splendor but tranquility and occupation which give you happiness money cant buy happiness but it can make you awfully comfortable while youre being miserable action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action true happiness is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose happiness is like a kiss you must share it to enjoy it if your happiness depends on what somebody else does i guess you do have a problem but what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads love is trembling happiness happiness is the only good the time to be happy is now the place to be happy is here the way to be happy is to make others so happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance order rhythm and harmony happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length if you want to be happy be be happy for this moment this moment is your life to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness in order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness  otherwise how would you know when youre happy your successes and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them true happiness is to enjoy the present without anxious dependence upon the future happy is the man who has broken the chains which hurt the mind and has given up worrying once and for all you can be happy where you are happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of ones values an effort made for the happiness of others lifts above ourselves everyone chases after happiness not noticing that happiness is right at their heels a sure way to lose happiness i found is to want it at the expense of everything else the two enemies of human happiness are pain and boredom happiness is found in doing not merely possessing the person born with a talent they are meant to use will find their greatest happiness in using it what we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of anything youre good at contributes to happiness there is only one happiness in this life to love and be loved happiness is an inside job every gift from a friend is a wish for your happiness all happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love happiness is a continuation of happenings which are not resisted happiness depends more on how life strikes you than on what happens there is something curiously boring about somebody elses happiness nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people in society it is a goal and an essential part of my life  a kind of destiny whoever is in distress can call on me i will come running wherever they are never mind your happiness do your duty you know its love when all you want is that person to be happy even if youre not part of their happiness happiness is ideal it is the work of the imagination do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself all who joy would win must share it happiness was born a twin you must try to generate happiness within yourself if you arent happy in one place chances are you wont be happy anyplace the greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness happiness an agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of another i am a kind of paranoid in reverse i suspect people of plotting to make me happy happiness is neither without us nor within us it is in god both without us and within us happiness exists on earth and it is won through prudent exercise of reason knowledge of the harmony of the universe and constant practice of generosity man needs for his happiness not only the enjoyment of this or that but hope and enterprise and change always leave something to wish for otherwise you will be miserable from your very happiness it is not gods will merely that we should be happy but that we should make ourselves happy when what we are is what we want to be thats happiness happiness is like those palaces in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons we must fight in order to conquer it happy he who learns to bear what he cannot change dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved happiness is having a scratch for every itch happiness grows at our own firesides and is not to be picked in strangers gardens the secret of happiness is to admire without desiring if you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured it may never arrive mountains will not be climbed races won or lasting happiness achieved happiness does not lie in happiness but in the achievement of it happiness comes only when we push our brains and hearts to the farthest reaches of which we are capable happiness is a direction not a place nothing prevents happiness like the memory of happiness the happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions true happiness consists not in the multitude of friends but in the worth and choice lovers who love truly do not write down their happiness its pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness poverty and wealth have both failed happiness is brief it will not stay god batters at its sails money cant buy you happiness but it can buy you a yacht big enough to pull up right alongside it happiness isnt something you experience its something you remember happiness is itself a kind of gratitude it is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be what he is it is not easy to find happiness in ourselves and it is not possible to find it elsewhere the moments of happiness we enjoy take us by surprise it is not that we seize them but that they seize us to describe happiness is to diminish it our happiness depends on wisdom all the way happiness includes chiefly the idea of satisfaction after full honest effort no one can possibly be satisfied and no one can be happy who feels that in some paramount affairs he failed to take up the challenge of life if you hope for happiness in the world hope for it from god and not from the world desire is individual happiness is common one of the keys to happiness is a bad memory happiness never lays its finger on its pulse happiness is the interval between periods of unhappiness happiness is like a cloud if you stare at it long enough it evaporates people let their own hangups become the obstacles between them and personal happiness unquestionably it is possible to do without happiness it is done involuntarily by nineteentwentieths of mankind happiness is a virtue not its reward happiness is mostly a byproduct of doing what makes us feel fulfilled happiness seems made to be shared there is only one passion the passion for happiness the happiness of most people is not ruined by great catastrophes or fatal errors but by the repetition of slowly destructive little things happiness is a byproduct you cannot pursue it by itself happiness is the harvest of a quiet eye happiness does not consist in selflove growth itself contains the germ of happiness to buy happiness is to sell soul only man clogs his happiness with care destroying what is with thoughts of what may be happiness is composed of misfortunes avoided love is the most terrible and also the most generous of the passions it is the only one which includes in its dreams the happiness of someone else satisfaction of ones curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life life in common among people who love each other is the ideal of happiness we possess only the happiness we are able to understand how easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success if you have easy selfcontentment you might have a very very cheap source of happiness to attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something while to secure it in this world we must do something we are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier the right to happiness is fundamental life everlasting in a state of happiness is the greatest desire of all men the happiness which is lacking makes one think even the happiness one has unbearable there is happiness in duty although it may not seem so the secret of happiness is to admire without desiring and that is not happiness happiness will come from materialism not from meaning so long as we can lose any happiness we possess some happiness is hard to recall its just a glow the action is best that secures the greatest happiness for the greatest number there is no worse sorrow than remembering happiness in the day of sorrow affection is responsible for ninetenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives if we can but prevent the government from wasting the labours of the people under the pretence of taking care of them they must become happy happiness is not something you postpone for the future it is something you design for the present thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle and the life of the candle will not be shortened happiness never decreases by being shared you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life to enjoy good health to bring true happiness to ones family to bring peace to all one must first discipline and control ones own mind if a man can control his mind he can find the way to enlightenment and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him the u s constitution doesnt guarantee happiness only the pursuit of it you have to catch up with it yourself your success and happiness lies in you resolve to keep happy and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties happiness resides not in possessions and not in gold happiness dwells in the soul it is very important to generate a good attitude a good heart as much as possible from this happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come happiness cannot be traveled to owned earned worn or consumed happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love grace and gratitude god cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from himself because it is not there there is no such thing friends show their love in times of trouble not in happiness love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own jealousy is a disease love is a healthy condition the immature mind often mistakes one for the other or assumes that the greater the love the greater the jealousy money has never made man happy nor will it there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness the more of it one has the more one wants today i choose life every morning when i wake up i can choose joy happiness negativity pain to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices  today i choose to feel life not to deny my humanity but embrace it the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness it is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only object of good government but o how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes i heard a definition once happiness is health and a short memory i wish id invented it because it is very true happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city the true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life happiness is not being pained in body or troubled in mind truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness success is getting what you want happiness is wanting what you get true happiness involves the full use of ones power and talents man falls from the pursuit of the ideal of plan living and high thinking the moment he wants to multiply his daily wants mans happiness really lies in contentment no one has a right to consume happiness without producing it love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own no matter how dull or how mean or how wise a man is he feels that happiness is his indisputable right never make friends with people who are above or below you in status such friendships will never give you any happiness since you get more joy out of giving joy to others you should put a good deal of thought into the happiness that you are able to give god will prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven and if it takes my dog being there i believe hell be there marriage is the most natural state of man and the state in which you will find solid happiness it is a curious sensation the sort of pain that goes mercifully beyond our powers of feeling when your heart is broken your boats are burned nothing matters any more it is the end of happiness and the beginning of peace choose your lifes mate carefully from this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery are you bored with life then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart live for it die for it and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours they must often change who would be constant in happiness or wisdom we find delight in the beauty and happiness of children that makes the heart too big for the body three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for politicians also have no leisure because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself power and glory or happiness different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government dont wish me happiness  i dont expect to be happy its gotten beyond that somehow wish me courage and strength and a sense of humor  i will need them all a mothers happiness is like a beacon lighting up the future but reflected also on the past in the guise of fond memories there is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself the man who makes everything that leads to happiness depends upon himself and not upon other men has adopted the very best plan for living happily this is the man of moderation the man of manly character and of wisdom the only thing that could spoil a day was people people were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself money wont buy happiness but it will pay the salaries of a large research staff to study the problem to find out what one is fitted to do and to secure an opportunity to do it is the key to happiness success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful happiness is neither virtue nor pleasure nor this thing nor that but simply growth we are happy when we are growing the smallest seed of faith is better than the largest fruit of happiness happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best i would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder independence is happiness happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort we have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it never permit a dichotomy to rule your life a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time i start to think there really is no cure for depression that happiness is an ongoing battle and i wonder if it isnt one ill have to fight for as long as i live i wonder if its worth it happiness can exist only in acceptance people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost remember happiness doesnt depend upon who you are or what you have it depends solely on what you think there is no austerity equal to a balanced mind and there is no happiness equal to contentment there is no disease like covetousness and no virtue like mercy there is nothing i fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources those who are poor illiterate and ridden with terminal disease the happiness of this life depends less on what befalls you than the way in which you take it a man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside thinking that his happiness lies outside him finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him the world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity and a lot of judgment i just think people need to start shifting into joy and happiness as corny as it sounds we need to make a shift there is joy in work there is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something be more dedicated to making solid achievements than in running after swift but synthetic happiness life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles but in avoiding them a masterly retreat is in itself a victory the word happiness would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness no one is in control of your happiness but you therefore you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change our object in the construction of the state is the greatest happiness of the whole and not that of any one class success is getting what you want happiness is liking what you get success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best of course to have money is just great because you can do what you think is important to you i always was a rich person because moneys not related to happiness happiness is a butterfly which when pursued is always just beyond your grasp but which if you will sit down quietly may alight upon you wealth like happiness is never attained when sought after directly it comes as a byproduct of providing a useful service we all want to help one another human beings are like that we want to live by each others happiness not by each others misery love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness the happiness of society is the end of government the happiness and peace attained by those satisfied by the nectar of spiritual tranquillity is not attained by greedy persons restlessly moving here and there happiness is a ball after which we run wherever it rolls and we push it with our feet when it stops a really great talent finds its happiness in execution all you need for happiness is a good gun a good horse and a good wife it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe the person who seeks all their applause from outside has their happiness in anothers keeping  the secret of happiness is this let your interests be as wide as possible and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile the greatest happiness is to know the source of unhappiness the secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible the art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things action may not bring happiness but there is no happiness without action the supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather in spite of ourselves god isnt compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness you must make your choice our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness the only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open there is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery the essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things happiness is beneficial for the body but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind money is human happiness in the abstract he then who is no longer capable of enjoying human happiness in the concrete devotes himself utterly to money one of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between man and nature shall not be broken for the poison of hatred seated near the heart doubles the burden for the one who suffers the disease he is burdened with his own sorrow and groans on seeing anothers happiness happiness a good cigar a good meal a good cigar and a good woman  or a bad woman it depends on how much happiness you can handle ive made an odd discovery every time i talk to a savant i feel quite sure that happiness is no longer a possibility yet when i talk with my gardener im convinced of the opposite contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other peoples happiness and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race it is not in the pursuit of happiness that we find fulfillment it is in the happiness of pursuit a wise woman recognizes when her life is out of balance and summons the courage to act to correct it she knows the meaning of true generosity happiness is the reward for a life lived in harmony with a courage and grace what we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the preferably sudden satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree if there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others we could have a paradise in a few years live by this credo have a little laugh at life and look around you for happiness instead of sadness laughter has always brought me out of unhappy situations doing nothing is happiness for children and misery for old men a smile is happiness youll find right under your nose the first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion lifes greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved happiness is a hard master particularly other peoples happiness i do believe that if you havent learnt about sadness you cannot appreciate happiness where fear is happiness is not friendship improves happiness and abates misery by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief to be perfectly happy it does not suffice to possess happiness it is necessary to have deserved it how to gain how to keep how to recover happiness is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all they do and of all they are willing to endure procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy if all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness one test of the correctness of educational procedure is the happiness of the child men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone of all forms of caution caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness wisdom allows nothing to be good that will not be so forever no man to be happy but he that needs no other happiness than what he has within himself no man to be great or powerful that is not master of himself now and then its good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy happiness is the reward we get for living to the highest right we know my happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance and in inverse proportion to my expectations beauty is the promise of happiness happiness is not a reward  it is a consequence suffering is not a punishment  it is a result when ambition ends happiness begins if virtue promises happiness prosperity and peace then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us progress is always an approach toward it fun i love but too much fun is of all things the most loathsome mirth is better than fun and happiness is better than mirth did perpetual happiness in the garden of eden maybe get so boring that eating the apple was justified a man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy healthy and prosperous being and happiness health and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer of the man with his surroundings he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition will waste his life in fruitless efforts imagination disposes of everything it creates beauty justice and happiness which are everything in this world happiness is a byproduct of function purpose and conflict those who seek happiness for itself seek victory without war resolve not to be poor whatever you have spend less poverty is a great enemy to human happiness it certainly destroys liberty and it makes some virtues impracticable and others extremely difficult happiness is a how not a what a talent not an object happiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination bride a woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her happiness in this world when it comes comes incidentally make it the object of pursuit and it leads us a wildgoose chase and is never attained follow some other object and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it happiness is not a brilliant climax to years of grim struggle and anxiety it is a long succession of little decisions simply to be happy in the moment it were a real increase of human happiness could all young men from the age of nineteen be covered under barrels or rendered otherwise invisible and there left to follow their lawful studies and callings till they emerged sadder and wiser at the age of twentyfive when youre passionate about something you want it to be all it can be but in the endgame of life i fundamentally believe the key to happiness is letting go of that idea of perfection the consuming desire of most human beings is deliberately to plant their whole life in the hands of some other person i would describe this method of searching for happiness as immature development of character consists solely in moving toward selfsufficiency the only happiness a brave person ever troubles themselves in asking about is happiness enough to get their work done were taught to be ashamed of confusion anger fear and sadness and to me theyre of equal value to happiness excitement and inspiration a string of excited fugitive miscellaneous pleasures is not happiness happiness resides in imaginative reflection and judgment when the picture of ones life or of human life as it truly has been or is satisfies the will and is gladly accepted indeed man wishes to be happy even when he so lives as to make happiness impossible in friendship as well as love ignorance very often contributes more to our happiness than knowledge the white mans happiness cannot be purchased by the black mans misery while it is important for people to see your promise you must also remember that hope is the keeper of both happiness and disappointment the father of both progress and failure happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised happiness is the absence of the striving for happiness even in the common affairs of life in love friendship and marriage how little security have we when we trust our happiness in the hands of others the happiness and misery of men depend no less on temper than fortune man is fond of counting his troubles but he does not count his joys if he counted them up as he ought to he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it the health of the people is really the foundation upon which all their happiness and all their powers as a state depend no man chooses evil because it is evil he only mistakes it for happiness the good he seeks happiness is your own treasure because it lies within you my creed is that happiness is the only good the place to be happy is here the time to be happy is now the way to be happy is to make others so ive learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances to be stupid selfish and have good health are three requirements for happiness though if stupidity is lacking all is lost life does not agree with philosophy there is no happiness that is not idleness and only what is useless is pleasurable true happiness arises in the first place from the enjoyment of ones self and in the next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions nothing flatters a man as much as the happiness of his wife he is always proud of himself as the source of it why love if losing hurts so much i have no answers anymore only the life i have lived the pain now is part of the happiness then ladies of fashion starve their happiness to feed their vanity and their love to feed their pride the secret to happiness is freedom and the secret to freedom is courage the intense happiness of our union is derived in a high degree from the perfect freedom with which we each follow and declare our own impressions people say that money is not the key to happiness but i always figured if you have enough money you can have a key made we must have courage to bet on our ideas to take the calculated risk and to act everyday living requires courage if life is to be effective and bring happiness when youre happy you find pure joy in your life there are no regrets in this state of happiness  and thats a goal worth striving for in all areas of your life it is not true that suffering ennobles the character happiness does that sometimes but suffering for the most part makes men petty and vindictive whether happiness may come or not one should try and prepare ones self to do without it a womans heart must be of such a size and no larger else it must be pressed small like chinese feet her happiness is to be made as cakes are by a fixed recipe every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time and may therefore be demanded back the next hour for happiness one needs security but joy can spring like a flower even from the cliffs of despair happiness is the natural flower of duty no man is happy without a delusion of some kind delusions are as necessary to our happiness as realities the happiness of life is made up of minute fractions  the little soon forgotten charities of a kiss or a smile a kind look or heartfelt compliment we exaggerate misfortune and happiness alike we are never as bad off or as happy as we say we are mans only true happiness is to live in hope of something to be won by him reverence something to be worshipped by him and love something to be cherished by him forever happiness lies neither in vice nor in virtue but in the manner we appreciate the one and the other and the choice we make pursuant to our individual organization happiness is good health and a bad memory happiness is different from pleasure happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing the man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent and he is never bored and life is only too short and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness it is pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness poverty and wealth have both failed i have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires rather than in attempting to satisfy them work and live to serve others to leave the world a little better than you found it and garner for yourself as much peace of mind as you can this is happiness i am about to be married and am of course in all the misery of a man in pursuit of happiness there is a difference between happiness and wisdom he that thinks himself the happiest man is really so but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool subordination tends greatly to human happiness were we all upon an equality we should have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleasure happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance money cant buy you happiness but it does bring you a more pleasant form of misery i thank my god for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness whoever said money cant buy happiness simply didnt know where to go shopping our envy always lasts longer than the happiness of those we envy i have this really high priority on happiness and finding something to be happy about selfpity comes so naturally to all of us the most solid happiness can be shaken by the compassion of a fool the happiness of the bee and the dolphin is to exist for man it is to know that and to wonder at it beauty for some provides escape who gain a happiness in eyeing the gorgeous buttocks of the ape or autumn sunsets exquisitely dying while we are focusing on fear worry or hate it is not possible for us to be experiencing happiness enthusiasm or love the most worthwhile thing is to try to put happiness into the lives of others little islands of human happiness peace and prosperity are so exceptional at this point in history that im not even sure we can draw lessons from them the happiness of ones own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul one must try to include as necessary to ones own happiness the happiness of others caring about others running the risk of feeling and leaving an impact on people brings happiness wisdom is the supreme part of happiness plenty of people miss their share of happiness not because they never found it but because they didnt stop to enjoy it the great thing in the world is not so much to seek happiness as to earn peace and selfrespect curiosity is one of the great secrets of happiness there is no end of craving hence contentment alone is the best way to happiness therefore acquire contentment i refuse to accept other peoples ideas of happiness for me as if theres a one size fits all standard for happiness i would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government other than another it is of no moment to the happiness of an individual we are long before we are convinced that happiness is never to be found and each believes it possessed by others to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern there is nothing sir too little for so little a creature as man it is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible there is no private house in which people can enjoy themselves so well as at a capital tavern no sir there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn happiness is a choice that requires effort at times happiness is the only sanction of life where happiness fails existence remains a mad and lamentable experiment you traverse the world in search of happiness which is within the reach of every man a contented mind confers it on all there is no true love save in suffering and in this world we have to choose either love which is suffering or happiness man is the more man  that is the more divine  the greater his capacity for suffering or rather for anguish i can say that i never knew what joy was like until i gave up pursuing happiness or cared to live until i chose to die for these two discoveries i am beholden to jesus happiness serves hardly any other purpose than to make unhappiness possible music should probably provide answers in terms of lyrical content and giving people a sense of togetherness and oneness as opposed to being alone in their thoughts and dilemmas or regrets or happiness or whatever our principles are the springs of our actions our actions the springs of our happiness or misery too much care therefore cannot be taken in forming our principles to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea there is this difference between happiness and wisdom he that thinks himself the happiest man really is so but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool the founders of a new colony whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion as the site of a prison money may not buy happiness but it can damn well give it i hump the wild to take it all in there is no bag limit on happiness every day is a new day and youll never be able to find happiness if you dont move on suspicion is not less an enemy to virtue than to happiness he that is already corrupt is naturally suspicious and he that becomes suspicious will quickly be corrupt the world is full of people looking for spectacular happiness while they snub contentment a sincere and steadfast cooperation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the united states when we recall the past we usually find that it is the simplest things  not the great occasions  that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness dancing and running shake up the chemistry of happiness know then this truth enough for man to know virtue alone is happiness below my imagination can picture no fairer happiness than to continue living for art i have discovered the secret of happiness  it is work either with the hands or the head the moment i have something to do the draughts are open and my chimney draws and i am happy power after love is the first source of happiness selfesteem is as important to our wellbeing as legs are to a table it is essential for physical and mental health and for happiness happiness is inward and not outward and so it does not depend on what we have but on what we are my whole working philosophy is that the only stable happiness for mankind is that it shall live married in blessed union to womankind  intimacy physical and psychical between a man and his wife i wish to add that my state of bliss is by no means perfect the secret of happiness is something to do we never taste happiness in perfection our most fortunate successes are mixed with sadness if you ever find happiness by hunting for it you will find it as the old woman did her lost spectacles safe on her own nose all the time i take it that the good of mankind means the attainment by every man of all the happiness which he can enjoy without diminishing the happiness of his fellow men people are surprised at how downtoearth i am i like to stay home on friday nights and listen to the art of happiness by the dalai lama happiness is within it has nothing to do with how much applause you get or how many people praise you happiness comes when you believe that you have done something truly meaningful happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it is love is not a feeling of happiness love is a willingness to sacrifice character is the basis of happiness and happiness the sanction of character knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of happiness we believe as our founders did that the pursuit of happiness depends upon individual liberty and individual liberty requires limited government ones work usually occupies more than half of ones waking life choosing work that does not bring happiness will lead to a life that is mostly disappointing i understand by this passion the union of desire friendship and tenderness which is inflamed by a single female which prefers her to the rest of her sex and which seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our being what would there be in a story of happiness only what prepares it only what destroys it can be told a wise woman never yields by appointment it should always be an unforeseen happiness completeness happiness these words dont come close to describing my emotions there truly is nothing i can say to capture what motherhood means to me particularly given my medical history when a man has lost all happiness hes not alive call him a breathing corpse happiness is secured through virtue it is a good attained by mans own will you take away all the other luxuries in life and if you can make someone smile and laugh you have given the most special gift happiness happiness a good bank account a good cook and a good digestion happiness is your dentist telling you it wont hurt and then having him catch his hand in the drill false happiness renders men stern and proud and that happiness is never communicated true happiness renders them kind and sensible and that happiness is always shared happiness isnt getting what you want its wanting what you got whats the use of happiness it cant buy you money although the skills arent hard to learn finding the happiness and finding the satisfaction and finding fulfillment in continuously serving somebody else something good to eat is what makes a really good restaurant genuine happiness can only be achieved when we transform our way of life from the unthinking pursuit of pleasure to one committed to enriching our inner lives when we focus on being more rather than simply having more my whole thing is to agree to disagree and to have respect because nothing can really be changed and you wouldnt want to ruin their happiness  even if that happiness is ignorance the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not our circumstances the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness you know the passage where scarlett voices her happiness that her mother is dead so that she cant see what a bad girl scarlett has become well thats me a good way i know to find happiness is to not bore a hole to fit the plug and one who is just of his own free will shall not lack for happiness and he will never come to utter ruin to desire and strive to be of some service to the world to aim at doing something which shall really increase the happiness and welfare and virtue of mankind  this is a choice which is possible for all of us and surely it is a good haven to sail for to be obliged to beg our daily happiness from others bespeaks a more lamentable poverty than that of him who begs his daily bread im fulfilled in what i do i never thought that a lot of money or fine clothes  the finer things of life  would make you happy my concept of happiness is to be filled in a spiritual sense one of the indictments of civilizations is that happiness and intelligence are so rarely found in the same person grief at the absence of a loved one is happiness compared to life with a person one hates if you have not taken the time to define what happiness means to you what have your spent your whole life pursuing there is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball and that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all i want anyone who believes in life liberty pursuit of happiness to succeed and i want any force any person any element of an overarching big government that would stop your success i want that organization that element or that person to fail i want you to succeed existence is a strange bargain life owes us little we owe it everything the only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose so long as you dont feel lifes paltry and a miserable business the rest doesnt matter happiness or unhappiness i might have some character traits that some might see as innocence or naive thats because i discovered peace and happiness in my soul and with this knowledge i also see the beauty of human life unhappiness is something we are never taught about we are taught to expect happiness but never a plan b to use to use when the happiness doesnt arrive happiness that grand mistress of the ceremonies in the dance of life impels us through all its mazes and meanderings but leads none of us by the same route always remember that the most important thing in a good marriage is not happiness but stability happiness is mental harmony unhappiness is mental inharmony happiness is a thing to be practiced like the violin i know not why there is such a melancholy feeling attached to the remembrance of past happiness except that we fear that the future can have nothing so bright as the past music is the refuge of souls ulcerated by happiness when i was waiting tables washing dishes or mowing lawns for money i never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life i was on my own path my own journey an american journey where i could think for myself decide for myself define happiness for myself romance and novel paint beauty in colors more charming than nature and describe a happiness that humans never taste how deceptive and destructive are those pictures of consummate bliss happiness is obsolete uneconomic a pencil and rubber are of more use to thought than a battalion of assistants to happiness the same applies as to truth one does not have it but is in it happiness is an attitude of mind born of the simple determination to be happy under all outward circumstances grief knits two hearts in closer bonds than happiness ever can and common sufferings are far stronger links than common joys now i believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid entwined together on a bed of clover and left there to sleep left there to dream of their happiness some of us might find happiness if we quit struggling so desperately for it actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness by happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain i wish people could acheive what they think would bring them happiness in order for them to realize that thats not really what happiness is such happiness as life is capable of comes from the full participation of all our powers in the endeavor to wrest from each changing situations of experience its own full and unique meaning the secret to true happiness is a combination of low expectations and insensitivity i saw that all beings are fated to happiness action is not life but a way of wasting some force an enervation morality is the weakness of the brain crying is cleansing theres a reason for tears happiness or sadness success is getting and achieving what you want happiness is wanting and being content with what you get just stop for a minute and youll realize youre happy just being i think its the pursuit that screws up happiness if we drop the pursuit its right here one mustnt ask apple trees for oranges france for sun women for love life for happiness oh if i had been loved at the age of seventeen what an idiot i would be today happiness is like smallpox if you catch it too soon it can completely ruin your constitution we are built to conquer environment solve problems achieve goals and we find no real satisfaction or happiness in life without obstacles to conquer and goals to achieve thus happiness depends as nature shows less on exterior things than most suppose alas if the principles of contentment are not within us the height of station and worldly grandeur will as soon add a cubit to a mans stature as to his happiness happiness and virtue rest upon each other the best are not only the happiest but the happiest are usually the best tell him on the contrary that he needs in the interest of his own happiness to walk in the path of humility and selfcontrol and he will be indifferent or even actively resentful an act of goodness is of itself an act of happiness no reward coming after the event can compare with the sweet reward that went with it people truly reaching across boundaries  be they religious or race political or geographic a state that is sincerely civil and respectful of each individuals pathway toward life liberty and the pursuit of happiness will be our goal gods children and their happiness are my reasons for being happiness in the present is only shattered by comparison with the past happiness is a sunbeam which may pass through a thousand bosoms without losing a particle of its original ray nay when it strikes on a kindred heart like the converged light on a mirror it reflects itself with redoubled brightness it is not perfected till it is shared in theory there is a possibility of perfect happiness to believe in the indestructible element within one and not to strive towards it i really love being alive i love my family and my work i love the opportunity i have to do things thats what happiness is happiness is a monstrosity punished are those who seek it happiness is a very small desk and a very big wastebasket everyone has their own way of expressing happiness my faith helps me understand that circumstances dont dictate my happiness my inner peace if thou be industrious to procure wealth be generous in the disposal of it man never is so happy as when he giveth happiness unto another what ever our wandering our happiness will always be found within a narrow compass and in the middle of the objects more immediately within our reach there is no cosmetic for beauty like happiness today we stand as a united country and are much closer to the ideals set forth in our constitution that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness offspring the due performance on religious rites faithful service highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself depend on ones wife alone objects we ardently pursue bring little happiness when gained most of our pleasures come from unexpected sources for this generation ours life is nuclear survival liberty is human rights the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants happiness is dependent on selfdiscipline we are the biggest obstacles to our own happiness it is much easier to do battle with society and with others than to fight our own nature the will of man is his happiness the constitution guarantees us our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness thats all it doesnt guarantee our rights to charity life is to be fortified by many friendships to love and to be loved is the greatest happiness of existence everyone needs a certain amount of money beyond that we pursue money because we know how to obtain it we dont necessarily know how to obtain happiness ive never felt like i was in the cookie business ive always been in a feel good feeling business my job is to sell joy my job is to sell happiness my job is to sell an experience this happiness consisted of nothing else but the harmony of the few things around me with my own existence a feeling of contentment and wellbeing that needed no changes and no intensification the happiness of the creature consists in rejoicing in god by which also god is magnified and exalted the said truth is that it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong happiness contentment the health and growth of the soul depend as men have proved over and over again upon some simple issue some single turning of the soul derive happiness in oneself from a good days work from illuminating the fog that surrounds us there are as many kinds of beauty as there are habitual ways of seeking happiness happiness consists in giving and in serving others off with you youre a happy fellow for youll give happiness and joy to many other people there is nothing better or greater than that there can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do you get to a certain age where you prepare yourself for happiness sometimes you never remember to actually get happy sorrow happens hardship happens the hell with it who never knew the price of happiness will not be happy happiness is working with jack lemmon happiness is spiritual born of truth and love it is unselfish therefore it cannot exist alone but requires all mankind to share it when you relinquish the desire to control your future you can have more happiness happiness is understanding that friendship is more precious than mere things more precious than getting your own way more precious than being in situations where true principles are not at stake it is one of my sources of happiness never to desire a knowledge of other peoples business the british do not expect happiness i had the impression all the time that i lived there that they do not want to be happy they want to be right values are principles and ideas that bring meaning to the seemingly mundane experience of life a meaningful life that ultimately brings happiness and pride requires you to respond to temptations as well as challenges with honor dignity and courage from their teenage years on children are considerably more capable of causing parents unhappiness than bringing them happiness that is one reason parents who rely on their children for happiness make both their children and themselves miserable but happiness is no respecter of persons he who avoids complaint invites happiness happiness and peace will come to earth only as the light of love and human compassion enter the souls of men the ultimate end of human acts is eudaimonia happiness in the sense of living well which all men desire all acts are but different means chosen to arrive at it i always seem to have a vague feeling that he is a satan among musicians a fallen angel in the darkness who is perpetually seeking to fight his way back to happiness but what is after all the happiness of mere power there is a greater happiness possible than to be lord of heaven and earth that is the happiness of being truly loved since every man desires happiness it is evidently no small matter whether he conceives of happiness in terms of work or of enjoyment the office of government is not to confer happiness but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves what can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health out of debt and has a clear conscience ultimately all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness why then have we ended up producing the opposite result could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness i can be forced to live without happiness but i will never consent to live without honor money if it does not bring you happiness will at least help you be miserable in comfort its enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back there is no happiness in having or in getting but only in giving happiness is no respecter of persons to be able to throw ones self away for the sake of a moment to be able to sacrifice years for a womans smile  that is happiness i dont know the true meaning of happiness those who won our independence valued liberty as an end and as a means they believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty maturity  among other things the unclouded happiness of the child at play who takes it for granted that he is at one with his playmates no one is guaranteed happiness you can pursue it but if you happen to find success along the way on that road to happiness conservatives believe you should not be demonized or penalized for it happiness comes when we test our skills towards some meaningful purpose when a small child i thought that success spelled happiness i was wrong happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment but soon flits away happiness isnt happiness unless theres a violinplaying goat i certainly wasnt happy happiness has to do with reason and only reason earns it what i was given was the thing you cant earn and cant keep and often dont even recognize at the time i mean joy happiness is perfume you cant pour it on somebody else without getting a few drops on yourself i have often met with happiness after some imprudent step which ought to have brought ruin upon me and although passing a vote of censure upon myself i would thank god for his mercy try to make at least one person happy every day if you cannot do a kind deed speak a kind word if you cannot speak a kind word think a kind thought count up if you can the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week in a year in a lifetime i dont understand why europeans and south americans can take more sophistication why is it that americans need to hear their happiness major and their tragedy minor and as jazzy as they can handle is a seventh chord are they not experiencing complex emotions the art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change happiness like a child must be allowed to grow up the ultimate end of education is happiness or a good human life a life enriched by the possession of every kind of good by the enjoyment of every type of satisfaction there is no fulfillment in things whatsoever and i think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness but what in fact does is having a cause having a passion and thats really what gives lifes true meaning weve got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because thats easier its much more difficult to make a film about happiness with lots of jokes in it the most exciting happiness is the happiness generated by forces beyond your control happiness is the longing for repetition the bluebird of happiness long absent from his life ned is visited by the chicken of depression it takes great wit and interest and energy to be happy the pursuit of happiness is a great activity one must be open and alive it is the greatest feat man has to accomplish if you are kept in ignorance of the true way and permit yourself to rely upon and be guided by the opinion of imperfect man you can never gain the riches that will bring you peace and lasting happiness fate often puts all the material for happiness and prosperity into a mans hands just to see how miserable he can make himself with them holiness not happiness is the chief end of man happiness is nothing but temporary moments here and there  and i love those but i would be bored out of my mind if i were happy all the time ive run into certain geniuses of individualism  they are very few and far between  who live their lives completely on their own terms they are very powerful and have a great amount of happiness we all should aspire to that as to happiness in this life it is hardly compatible with that diminished respect which ever attends the relinquishing of labour no human being can really understand another and no one can arrange anothers happiness there is no correlation between happiness and amounts of money even when they have nothing the irish emit a kind of happiness a joy and of all illumination which human reason can give none is comparable to the discovery of what we are our nature our obligations what happiness we are capable of and what are the means of attaining it as a child is indulged or checked in its early follies a ground is generally laid for the happiness or misery of the future man well there are two kinds of happiness grounded and ungrounded ungrounded happiness is cheesy and not based on reality grounded happiness is informed happiness based on the knowledge that the world sometimes sucks but even then you have to believe in yourself to play someone who is who they are because of the happiness and contentedness that theyve known in their life is interesting because of sort of how banal it is it is now possible to quantify peoples levels of happiness pretty accurately by asking them by observation and by measuring electrical activity in the brain in degrees from terrible pain to sublime joy oh i adored mickey mouse when i was a child he was the emblem of happiness and funniness you went to the movies then you saw two movies and a short when mickey mouse came on the screen and there was his big head my sister said she had to hold onto me i went berserk i adored mickey mouse when i was a child he was the emblem of happiness and funniness happiness is a matter of ones most ordinary and everyday mode of consciousness being busy and lively and unconcerned with self it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him its horrible when people are only interested in buying labels because it doesnt bring them the happiness they think it will an institution or reform movement that is not selfish must originate in the recognition of some evil that is adding to the sum of human suffering or diminishing the sum of happiness i learned from a very young age that if i pursued the things that truly excited me that they would reward in more important ways like happiness i enjoy being happy every day and hopefully you can hear my happiness in my music life is beautiful all people desire what they believe will make them happy if a person is not full of desire for god we can only conclude that he is engaged with another happiness one must never look for happiness one meets it by the way most people ask for happiness on condition happiness can only be felt if you dont set any condition true religion is giving and finding ones happiness by bringing happiness into the lives of others there is no happiness in love except at the end of an english novel when god loves a creature he wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery he wants him to know all that being alive can bring that is his best gift there is no happiness save in understanding the whole happiness is a wine of the rarest vintage and seems insipid to a vulgar taste i have my moments ever since i was a boy i never was someone who was at ease with happiness too often i embrace introspection and selfdoubt i wish i could embrace the good things people will survive and they will find happiness happiness only comes when youre not looking for it every poll about the left the right and happiness reveals that the farther left one goes the less happy the person is likely to be happiness held is the seed happiness shared is the flower a good cook is like a sorceress who dispenses happiness i am happy as happiness goes for a woman who has so many memories and who lives the lonely life of an actress lucky that man whose children make his happiness in life and not his grief the anguished disappointment of his hopes there is a set of religious or rather moral writings which teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness and vice to misery in this world a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine and to which we have but one objection namely that it is not true america has believed that in differentiation not in uniformity lies the path of progress it acted on this belief it has advanced human happiness and it has prospered remember the rights of the savage as we call him remember that the happiness of his humble home remember that the sanctity of life in the hill villages of afghanistan among the winter snows is as inviolable in the eye of almighty god as can be your own there is no happiness for people at the expense of other people it is the personality of the mistress that the home expresses men are forever guests in our homes no matter how much happiness they may find there i try to stress to my children that buying something never leads to true happiness getting married for me was the best thing i ever did i was suddenly beset with an immense sense of release that we have something more important than our separate selves and that is the marriage theres immense happiness that can come from working towards that the pursuit of happiness which american citizens are obliged to undertake tends to involve them in trying to perpetuate the moods tastes and aptitudes of youth why does watching a dog be a dog fill one with happiness happiness is always a coincidence i will always stay close to all compatriots and share together the happiness and suffering all happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast my idea of perfect happiness is a healthy family peace between nations and all the critics die the gratification of desire is not happiness happiness is a choice you can choose to be happy theres going to be stress in life but its your choice whether you let it affect you or not joy rather than happiness is the goal of life for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings it is based on the experience of ones identity as a being of worth and dignity that is happiness to be dissolved into something complete and great youve got to ask asking is in my opinion the worlds most powerful  and neglected  secret to success and happiness i never was someone who was at ease with happiness it was as if all of the happiness all of the magic of this blissful hour had flowed together into these stirring bittersweet tones and flowed away becoming temporal and transitory once more you believe happiness to be derived from the place in which once you have been happy but in truth it is centered in ourselves we all have a hungry heart and one of the things we hunger for is happiness so as much as i possibly could i stayed where i was happy i spent a great deal of time in my younger years just writing and reading walking around the woods in ohio where i grew up my life has run from misery to happiness happiness no its not there for me friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another life finds its purpose and fulfillment in the expansion of happiness those who seek happiness miss it and those who discuss it lack it try to put your happiness before anyone elses because you may never have done so in your entire life if you really think about it if you are really honest with yourself a comfortable house is a great source of happiness it ranks immediately after health and a good conscience the purpose of human life and the sense of happiness is to give the maximum what the man is able to give the sound of laughter is like the vaulted dome of a temple of happiness happiness is an imaginary condition formerly attributed by the living to the dead now usually attributed by adults to children and by children to adults the dalai lama he is a very wise man of great inner peace who believes that happiness is the purpose of our lives through his teachings and leadership he continues to make this world a better place in which to live its afterwards you realize that the feeling of happiness you had with a man didnt necessarily prove that you loved him when we were together i loved you deeply and you gave me so much happiness i can never repay you you know i think we indians are afraid to show and celebrate our happiness lest things change around but i feel that its okay to be sad and okay to show when you are happy ive gotten to a point where i realize that happiness doesnt come from the outside it is work work that one delights in that is the surest guarantor of happiness but even here it is a work that has to be earned by labor in ones earlier years one should labor so hard in youth that everything one does subsequently is easy by comparison what if i couldnt handle peoples opinions of me i know that shouldnt dictate a persons degree of peace or happiness in life but the problem is i chose a business saturated in judgment so my happiness doesnt come from money or fame my happiness comes from seeing life without struggle happiness is not a state to arrive at but a manner of traveling there is an old saying that money cant buy happiness if it could i would buy myself four hits every game remember that happiness is as contagious as gloom it should be the first duty of those who are happy to let others know of their gladness i admit i cant shake the idea that there is virtue in suffering that there is a sort of psychic economy whereby if you embrace success happiness and comfort these things have to be paid for happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply to enjoy simply to think freely to risk life to be needed i see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire in fact i consider it integral to our success mechanism becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble if you must have it in order to be happy then you are denying the happiness of the here and now to show a child what once delighted you to find the childs delight added to your own  this is happiness i believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves  that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation i dont think that sin and pursuing happiness are not necessarily the same thing how can you tell somebody whose is pursuing happiness that theyre somehow not american when that was the very first promise that america made the pursuit of happiness is a most ridiculous phrase if you pursue happiness youll never find it here is my prescription to heal all wounds watch the film funny girl at least five times eat at least 45 chocolate bars and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex i truly believe that through a combination of nutella old pals and barbra streisand we can achieve happiness and very probably world peace it is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first the very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose aiming at something outside self liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body without health no pleasure can be tasted by man without liberty no happiness can be enjoyed by society my parents theyve been my biggest influences and supporters since day one they teach me every day that happiness comes from within and not from something outside of your heart i think the key to happiness is allowing ourselves to not feel bad or guilty for feeling it and letting it be contagious and to not be dependent on other people to create your own happiness the discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star for me love is happiness and inspiration it is also rarer to find happiness in a man surrounded by the miracles of technology than among people living in the desert of the jungle and who by the standards set by our society would be considered destitute and out of touch people are chasing cash not happiness when you chase money youre going to lose youre just going to even if you get the money youre not going to be happy my mother is a big believer in being responsible for your own happiness she always talked about finding joy in small moments and insisted that we stop and take in the beauty of an ordinary day when i stop the car to make my kids really see a sunset i hear my mothers voice and smile i think happiness comes from selfacceptance we all try different things and we find some comfortable sense of who we are we look at our parents and learn and grow and move on we change there is no excellence without labor one cannot dream oneself into either usefulness or happiness and perfect happiness man thats a the pool is about 92 degrees the jacuzzi is about 102 and an avocado farm i guess happiness is not a state you want to be in all the time when youre in love youre so happy that you want to tell people about it but now i have to censor myself you need to protect the happiness you have ive worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and youre in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room youre taken care of and the food is amazing the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work worldly wealth is the devils bait and those whose minds feed upon riches recede in general from real happiness in proportion as their stores increase as the moon when she is fullest is farthest from the sun one thing ive been happy as peach pie about  because im all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home  is that nannies day cares and babysitters are all collapsing which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home i cant believe its been four years now and from watching that pilot we really all looked like babies its unbelievable just how far everything has come im happier now than ive ever been on the show and in my life i really owe so much of my happiness to glee the mindset of chasing that next 1 record doesnt exist for me anymore its more about being a wellrounded entertainer than being a pop artist obviously it would be wonderful to have a hit record but i dont base my happiness on that anymore its about the accomplishment of a project that satisfies me i just want to enjoy the ride the day when a sportsman stops thinking above all else of the happiness in his own effort and the intoxication of the power and physical balance he derives from it the day when he lets considerations of vanity or interest take over on this day his ideal will die there is something in the pang of change more than the heart can bear unhappiness remembering happiness pleasure only starts once the worm has got into the fruit to become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison i think the secret to happiness is having a teflon soul whatever comes your way you either let it slide or you cook with it i am more and more convinced that our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of life than on the nature of those events themselves my travels led me to where i am today sometimes these steps have felt painful difficult but led me to greater happiness and opportunites if someday they say of me that in my work i have contributed something to the welfare and happiness of my fellow man i shall be satisfied my mother was a public school teacher in virginia and we didnt have any money we just survived on happiness on being a happy family i think a child may be the only thing that could give me true happiness my happiness doesnt come from money or fame my happiness comes from seeing life without struggle it was physically difficult adjusting to wheelchair life but i remember a great relief and happiness that i was finally getting somewhere finding musicians to work with that were sympathetic i see happiness as a byproduct i dont think you can pursue happiness i think that phrase is one of the very few mistakes the founding fathers made im passionate about everything like my family and friends anybody i am talkin to is gonna be bona fide real there is no substitution for happiness period genuine happiness comes from within and often it comes in spontaneous feelings of joy i dont really care how i am remembered as long as i bring happiness and joy to people i am deeply convinced that happiness does not exist in this world i love walking down the street and seeing faces and drama and happiness and sadness and dirt and cleanliness so even though i consider myself a fairly upbeat person energetic and things like that i never do very well on happiness tests those in the west who dismiss the repressiveness of laws against women in countries like iran no matter how benign their intentions present a condescending view not just of the religion but also of women living in muslim majority countries as if the desire for choice and happiness is the monopoly of women in the west i dont have the recipe for happiness but i think the engine is simply having the desire when i was a little kid all i wanted to do was to escape what i thought was the country and get to a city probably film and television had influenced me so much i really thought the key to happiness was living a very artificial life in a penthouse in new york with martini glasses could a government dare to set out with happiness as its goal now that there are accepted scientific proofs it would be easy to audit the progress of national happiness annually just as we monitor money and gdp each person is living for himself his own happiness is all he can ever personally feel every happiness is a hostage to fortune joe e lewis said money doesnt buy happiness but it calms the nerves and that is how i feel about a film being wellreceived the cause of justice is the cause of humanity its advocates should overflow with universal good will we should love this cause for it conduces to the general happiness of mankind people need to realise what real happiness and success is because success as an actor is fleeting you can be up there one day and gone the next your dear baby has died innocent and blameless and has been called away by an all wise and merciful creator most probably from a life to misery and misfortune and most certainly to one of happiness and bliss every man judges his own happiness and satisfaction with life in terms of his possession or lack of possession of those things that he considers worthwhile and valuable as long as i am given the opportunity to keep performing and keep exploring in whatever medium ill be happy as long as i get to spend time with my family ill be happy as long as i can write in some form ill be happy it is the essential things like that i equate with happiness what i mean by that is that the point of life as i see it is not to write books or scale mountains or sail oceans but to achieve happiness and preferably an unselfish happiness i think people really marry far too much it is such a lottery after all and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness heartache is very fertile ground for songmaking but so is happiness so is absolute bliss there once was a demographic survey done to determine if money was connected to happiness and ireland was the only place where this did not turn out to be true goodness does not more certainly make men happy than happiness makes them good i think money is essential to happiness and right now i wouldnt want to be anyone other than wilbur smith  ive had a fantastic life rewarded far more heavily than i deserve maybe id like to be j k rowling but ill settle for second best aye im tellin ye happiness is one of the few things in this world that doubles every time you share it with someone else you can have a lot of unhappiness by not having money but the reverse is no guarantee of happiness happiness must be cultivated it is like character it is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment or it will run to weeds when you analyze happiness it turns out that the way you spend your time is extremely important households cities countries and nations have enjoyed great happiness when a single individual has taken heed of the good and beautiful such people not only liberate themselves they fill those they meet with a free mind this nation is notorious for its ability to make or fake anything cheaply madeinchina goods now fill homes around the world but our giant country has a small problem we cant manufacture the happiness of our people trifles make up the happiness or the misery of human life happiness or misery is in the mind it is the mind that lives even if happiness forgets you a little bit never completely forget about it ive often thought if i didnt make my marriage work i would have failed at my one true shot at happiness how often we fail to realize our good fortune in living in a country where happiness is more than a lack of tragedy we all agree that its fit to be as happy as we can and we need no instructor to teach us this knowledge tis born with us and is inseparable from our being but we very much need to be informd what is the true way to happiness if i have to apply five turns to the screw each day for the happiness of argentina i will do it feminisms agenda is basic it asks that women not be forced to choose between public justice and private happiness scarcely one person in a thousand is capable of tasting the happiness of others happiness lies first of all in health the slave may be happy but happiness is not enough happiness i do not know where to turn to discover you on earth in the air or the sky yet i know you exist and are no futile dream the greatest happiness comes from being vitally interested in something that excites all your energies life is made up of small pleasures happiness is made up of those tiny successes the big ones come too infrequently and if you dont collect all these tiny successes the big ones dont really mean anything the greatest happiness is to transform ones feelings into action i love acting its my playground it lets me explore but my happiness in this world  my level of peace  is never going to be dictated by acting but my happiness in this world  my level of peace  is never going to be dictated by acting seek happiness for its own sake and you will not find it seek for duty and happiness will follow as the shadow comes with the sunshine i had to try and find a way to express happiness without sounding corny history shows that our way of life is the stronger way from it has come more wealth more industry more happiness more human enlightenment than from any other way happiness doesnt depend on how much you have to enjoy but how much you enjoy what you have there is even a happiness  that makes the heart afraid the pop musicians often leave meaning in the dust and substitute it for cartoons the deeper artists  the grunge artists in the world and the emoticon people  tend to leave all of the happiness out of life like it just doesnt exist i dont like paris so much and its only eight shows i mean dont tell them that of course but everyone always thinks theyre so important and im sure they are but to me my happiness is more important when kate was born she was born into a world of joy and happiness and confidence the difference between the children is night and day shes happy shes thriving shes full of selfconfidence i tell her shes beautiful every day before i send her off to school shall i give you my recipe for happiness i find everything useful and nothing indispensable i find everything wonderful and nothing miraculous i reverence the body i avoid first causes like the plague i visited those friends whod just had a baby and she was washing dishes and he was cleaning the house and i burst with happiness and in their minds they were in this terrible domestic rut the divine of the lord in heaven is love for the reason that love is receptive of all things of heaven such as peace intelligence wisdom and happiness is anyone serious about the politics of happiness david cameron dipped a toe in the water using the word lightly but denying the hard policies it implies labour shies away from it but should take up the challenge happiness is a real objective phenomenon scientifically verifiable that means people and whole societies can now be measured over time and compared accurately with one another causes and cures for unhappiness can be quantified inequality makes everyone unhappy the poor most of all and that is well within the remit of the state more money gives less extra happiness the richer we get yet we are addicted to earning and spending more every year inside every adult theres still a child that lingers were happiness merchants  giving people the opportunity to dream like children you find happiness where you find it i love my family and i had a very wonderful magical childhood but new jersey was actually a very cold place there was such an intense concentration of wealth and such a low concentration of any actual human happiness the people have a right to the truth as they have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness while i gave up god a long time ago i never shook the habit of wanting to believe in something so i replaced my creed of everlasting life with life liberty and the pursuit of happiness its up to you to be responsible for how you feel if youre not happy your happiness lies in your hands you cant rely on a man to make you happy or complete you that starts with you i dont get a sense of american pride i just get a sense that everyone is here battling the same thing  that around the world everybodys after the same thing just some minor piece of happiness each day happiness for you we walk on a knife edge to the eyes you are a flickering light to the feet thin ice that cracks and so may no one touch you who loves you my greatest happiness is to serve my gracious king and country and i am envious only of glory for if it be a sin to covet glory i am the most offending soul alive im actually tougher on myself as i get older its a vicious cycle the things that are important in life are the things that you cant buy in life love health and happiness i say that and i believe that and i try to live that i will never forget my beautiful days with you in shanklin they are certainly the most pleasant ones of my life look i have tears in my eyes just to think about it i am furious to be here it is the end of happiness for a whole year the most simple things can bring the most happiness you need characters who want things they want love they want recognition they want happiness the women i know who have children and have careers they seem to be very happy they love their children and they love their jobs but happiness comes out of being willing to do your work in your twenties to find out who you are what you love real happiness is cheap enough yet how dearly we pay for its counterfeit suspicion is far more to be wrong than right more often unjust than just it is no friend to virtue and always an enemy to happiness the idea that happiness could have a share in beauty would be too much of a good thing getting pregnant wasnt easy and i found that devastating i really beat myself up for waiting so long when id always wanted children and family had been the basis of my happiness my whole life i get way too much happiness from good food the secret of happiness is the determination to be happy always rather than wait for outer circumstances to make one happy man must search for what is right and let happiness come on its own musicians are probably the most uncomfortable people in themselves in the world happiness i think only exists when youre a child and once you go past 11 unfortunately its gone we learn the inner secret of happiness when we learn to direct our inner drives our interest and our attention to something besides ourselves you do the right thing even if it makes you feel bad the purpose of life is not to be happy but to be worthy of happiness its not attractive when girls get superskinny guys dont like it girls dont like you as much you lose some happiness when thats all you think about my mum brought me up to think that personal happiness is more important than your family i think my capacity to change has given me tremendous happiness because who i am today i am completely content to be i have to keep reminding myself if you give your life to god he doesnt promise you happiness and that everything will go well but he does promise you peace you can have peace and joy even in bad circumstances the happiness of every country depends upon the character of its people rather than the form of its government the older i get the more i see that there really arent huge zeniths of happiness or a huge abyss of darkness as much as there used to be i tend to walk a middle ground i find that the older i get the more i see that there really arent huge zeniths of happiness or a huge abyss of darkness as much as there used to be some days are just bad days thats all you have to experience sadness to know happiness and i remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day thats just the way it is money is not necessarily although it helps a lot for happiness its not necessarily the best way to be happy to be rich you know for me however that beloved glowing little word happiness has become associated with everything i have felt since childhood upon hearing the sound of the word itself nevertheless whether in occurrences lasting days hours or mere minutes at a time i have experienced happiness often and have had brief encounters with it in my later years even in old age fame is indeed beautiful and benign and gentle and satisfying but happiness is something at once tender and brilliant beyond all things i want fame more than i can tell but more than i want fame i want happiness if happiness truly consisted in physical ease and freedom from care then the happiest individual would not be either a man or a woman it would be i think an american cow happiness is no laughing matter i come before you to declare that my sex are entitled to the inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the house a woman creates is a utopia she cant help it  cant help trying to interest her nearest and dearest not in happiness itself but in the search for it now an infinite happiness cannot be purchased by any price less than that which is infinite in value and infinity of merit can only result from a nature that is infinitely divine or perfect the free market economy is supposed to be the only path leading to the happiness of humanity by promoting wealth and prosperity power and influence of nations so after awhile you can only get so much happiness from a guy whos drunk come up and tell you youre great the inspired scriptures make the clear distinction between false and true riches and make plain the reason why happiness is gained and fully enjoyed only by those who find true riches friends have suggested that i am the least qualified person to talk about happiness because i am often down and sometimes profoundly depressed but i think thats where my qualification comes from because to know happiness it helps to know unhappiness by asking the question am i happy and via the answer setting out what i mean by happiness there is a political route that can be taken by asking another question  can politics deliver happiness and should it try so here is one of my theories on happiness we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end this view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of philip gould philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics when he died i felt like i had lost a limb yes women and men have to be open to love because if were not open then theres no way for us to find happiness but you can be open to it and still have no control over when its going to happen so i started chanting when i was nineteen which was about twelve years ago and it really had a huge impact on my outlook happiness and general creativity this is true enough but success is the next best thing to happiness and if you cant be happy as a success its very unlikely that you would find a deeper truer happiness in failure every man hath a general desire of his own happiness and likewise a variety of particular affections passions and appetites to particular external objects happiness or satisfaction consists only in the enjoyment of those objects which are by nature suited to our several particular appetites passions and affections the principle we call selflove never seeks anything external for the sake of the thing but only as a means of happiness or good particular affections rest in the external things themselves the sum of the whole is plainly this the nature of man considered in his single capacity and with respect only to the present world is adapted and leads him to attain the greatest happiness he can for himself in the present world my parents were not very happy they were very worried about me pursuing a career that even if i had talent might not give me the happiness and the success that they  any parent hopes for their child some of us learned in a school of philosophy which taught that all was for the common good and nothing for oneself and have never in any case regarded the pursuit of happiness as anything other than an aberration of the human spirit i think essentially the meaning of life is probably the journey and not really any one thing or an outcome or a result i think its kinda the process and i think that if you can find happiness in the process then maybe thats it happiness does not come from football awards its terrible to correlate happiness with football happiness comes from a good job being able to feed your wife and kids i dont dream football i dream the american dream  two cars in a garage be a happy father ive had a good life enough happiness enough success the independence of all political and other bother is a happiness to have the sense of creative activity is the great happiness and the great proof of being alive only one thing has to change for us to know happiness in our lives where we focus our attention happiness is making your dreams come true individuality is the aim of political liberty by leaving the citizen as much freedom of action and of being as comports with order and the rights of others the institutions render him truly a freeman he is left to pursue his means of happiness in his own manner i just hope i can spread some of the happiness thats been coming my way money brings some happiness but after a certain point it just brings more money i think government has a major role to play in helping us with the pursuit of happiness sadness is a very interesting idea this idea of sadness being some kind of default setting that artists will go into and then i started thinking about this idea of sadness and happiness and the idea that sadness is very loud and happiness is quiet happiness is like a cat if you try to coax it or call it it will avoid you it will never come but if you pay not attention to it and go about your business youll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap happiness is not that easy to achieve but having a handsome husband a beautiful baby and a great job helps to me the most important thing is happiness the music is the message the message is the music so thats my little ministry that the big man upstairs gave to me  a little ministry called love and happiness the life and liberty and property and happiness of the common man throughout the world are at the absolute mercy of a few persons whom he has never seen involved in complicated quarrels that he has never heard of its obvious but perhaps worth saying that happiness has virtually nothing to do with the state of your intellect one of my producers said this business is like a hamster on that little wheel thing that goes around and around you may have a great day and get great ratings but then youve got another show to do  whatever moment of success or happiness you have youve got to keep grinding it out for the next day the arts are weapons of understanding and weapons of happiness i envy the happiness of others i envy the sense of belonging i seem always to be remaking myself i believe there is a relationship between having an interest in the arts and the behaviour of society as a whole some politicians find it difficult that the arts is a weapon of happiness politics is often about deprivation rather than the opening up of ideas and nourishing creative endeavour to seduce a woman famous for strict morals religious fervor and the happiness of her marriage what could possibly be more prestigious many a happiness in life as many a disaster can be due to chance but the peace within us can never be governed by chance happiness is rarely absent it is we that know not of its presence the object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or of races but the happiness of common man mystery is gone to the certainty of technological principles so the real terror the real aggression against life comes in the form of the pursuit of our technological happiness the arrival of any child brings you a lot of happiness we have a long heritage of freedom that defines america we believe there is a creator who blessed us with life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in securing the future of the planet we secure happiness for ourselves one of the aims of the greens is to turn around the tide of pessimism amongst the young people of the world but if you believe in christ and that your main goal with your life is supposed to be to honor him and do his will then you dont have as much pressure as someone who bases all their happiness on whether theyre a movie star i think people should know more of africa in terms of its joie de vivre its feeling for life in spite of the images that one knows about africa  the economic poverty the corruption  theres a joy to living and a happiness in community living together in community life which may be missing here in america the only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose happiness is the absence of suffering i think its an interesting way of looking at it i think the absence of suffering exists very rarely in the world we live in i am deeply grateful for the concern of all those who constantly prayed for my happiness eventually we reach the point where we start to realize that we are not going to find peace contentment happiness strength fearlessness  all of the things that in our heart of hearts we wish we had  outside of us happiness for me is getting to write about the most important things i know my biography of frank sinatra is not paean to his music but rather an illumination of the man behind the music who once described himself as an 18karat manicdepressive who lived a life of violent emotional contradictions with an overacute capacity for sadness as well as happiness bring love and peace and happiness and beautiful lives into the world in my honor thank you love you theres a higher form of happiness in commitment im counting on it first and foremost youve got to make yourself happy essentially being who you are is the most important thing when youre after truth happiness always comes you know american citizens i dont think ever thought that the right to the pursuit of happiness did not include the right to marry the person you love but for a whole number of americans gay americans that happens to be true according to your sympathy you will take pleasure in your own happiness or in the happiness of other people but it is always your own happiness you seek fashion is all about happiness its fun its important but its not medicine ive had at least my share of tragedy but i have had far more than my share of happiness for my part i do not feel that the scheme of future happiness which ought by rights to be in preparation for me will be at all interfered with by my not meeting again the man i have in my mind happiness has a bad rap people say it shouldnt be your goal in life oh yes it should more company increases happiness but does not lighten or diminish misery happiness was not made to be boasted but enjoyed therefore tho others count me miserable i will not believe them if i know and feel myself to be happy nor fear them to think the world therefore a general bedlam or place of madmen and oneself a physician is the most necessary point of present wisdom an important imagination and the way to happiness but it is my happiness to be half welsh and that the better half we need fundamental change in the past national development led to peoples happiness but now the link between national growth and improvement in peoples lives has been severed time the great destroyer of other mens happiness only enlarges the patrimony of literature to its possessor there is no dramatic difference in happiness on the part of people who are wealthy well my thoughts about california are kind of mythological to me as well as being a real place its a place where people go to find something  to find happiness or to realize their dreams so it has that kind of quality of heroism and heartache and australia has that as well i used to wonder if it was gods plan that i should be alone for so much of my life but i found peace i found happiness within people and the world the lesson i have thoroughly learnt and wish to pass on to others is to know the enduring happiness that the love of a garden gives politics are beautiful they enable a community to live collectively with one another its not about stabbing each other in the back its about enabling people to reach their dreams and pursue happiness i have a theory that the secret of marital happiness is simple drink in different pubs to your other half there may be peace without joy and joy without peace but the two combined make happiness well may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring responsibilities on which may depend our countrys peace and prosperity and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family an order of government established by such an allwise powerful being must be good and perfect and must be calculated to promote the permanent peace happiness and wellbeing of all his subjects michael has a connection with children just like mickey mouse does and he brings happiness to them and joy may there always be peace love and happiness in every house ones happiness depends less on what he knows than on what he feels if kind parents love their children and delight in their happiness then he who is perfect goodness in sending abroad mortal contagions doth assuredly direct their use every age has its happiness and troubles happiness is not a possession to be prized it is a quality of thought a state of mind traveling is the ruin of all happiness theres no looking at a building after seeing italy as long as you are being true to yourself you will always find happiness im an inherently happy person it comes from the inside which means you can achieve happiness under any circumstance the secret of happiness is to find a congenial monotony happiness consists not in having much but in being content with little i was as happy doing theater in new york for little or no money as i am now doing television for more money the happiness i guess comes out of it being a good job the success has to do with the fact that its a good job that will continue our nation was founded on the principals of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the united states are a political state or organized society whose end is government for the security welfare and happiness of all who live under its protection as a bookish child in calcutta i used to thrill to the adventures of bad girls whose pursuit of happiness swept them outside the bounds of social decency tess of the durbervilles emma bovary and anna karenina lived large in my imagination the naughty girls of hollywood films flirted and knew how to drive success can create more madness than happiness i ask the rights to pursue happiness by having a voice in that government to which i am accountable the secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it happiness is being on the beam with life  to feel the pull of life there is no such thing as the pursuit of happiness but there is the discovery of joy my family didnt have a lot of money and im grateful for that money is the longest route to happiness i always had a larger view im interested in real life  my family my friends i have tried never to define myself by my success whatever that is my happiness is way beyond roles and awards before the boat docked however he confessed because he was contemplating running for president he couldnt separate from his wife i believed him when he told me he faced a difficult choice between pursuing personal happiness and his political destiny so many people have said that to me that what they really like about alex is what she brings out in marissa and what this situation brings out in her a hint of happiness and another side to her character leibniz dedicated his life to efforts to educate people to understand that true happiness is found by locating their identity in benefitting mankind and their posterity being rich and famous isnt all happiness and at times the pressures have got to me i always looked for a man to rescue me and bring me happiness i bought into that myth of course and looked for my own prince charming for all its terrible faults in one sense america is still the last best hope of mankind because it spells out so vividly the kind of happiness that most people actually want regardless of what they are told they ought to want virtue is simply happiness and happiness is a byproduct of function you are happy when you are functioning fancy the happiness of pinocchio on finding himself free without saying yes or no he fled from the city and set out on the road that was to take him back to the house of the lovely fairy the folly of endless consumerism sends us on a wild goosechase for happiness through materialism there is no happiness outside of ourselves i have kids and i want to have a long life and there are certain things that are conducive to that and certain things that arent ive opted for the road of happiness and long life i keep mementos from everything ive done ive got my cab drivers license from happiness ive got a pair of glasses and a belt buckle from playing john lennon ive got a pair of sunglasses from playing andy warhol its all in a box in the garage vegas means comedy tragedy happiness and sadness all at the same time he who never sacrificed a present to a future good or a personal to a general one can speak of happiness only as the blind do of colors it is our happiness to live under the government of a prince who is satisfied with ruling according to law as every other good prince will  we enjoy under his administration all the liberty that is proper and expedient for us character is power it makes friends draws patronage and support and opens the way to wealth honor and happiness we all of us deserve happiness or none of us does you always hear the phrase money doesnt buy you happiness but i always in the back of my mind figured a lot of money will buy you a little bit of happiness but its not really true i got a new car because the old ones lease expired the sexes were made for each other and only in the wise and loving union of the two is the fullness of health and duty and happiness to be expected for mythology is the handmaid of literature and literature is one of the best allies of virtue and promoters of happiness ive never seen an obese person who has said i am well in my mind happiness stops food being a compensation happiness to some elation is to others mere stagnation im interested in the dark side of man im interested in taboos and murder is the greatest taboo characters are fascinating in their extremity not in their happiness id learned how much happiness money can bring you very little happiness is the real sense of fulfillment that comes from hard work i have a talent for happiness i look with the eyes of a painter and i see beauty the one happiness is to shut ones door upon a little room with a table before one and to create to create life in that isolation from life the groundwork of all happiness is health its good to follow the path of personal happiness to some extent people tend to get upset however when you drive a steamroller down it happiness consists in activity it is running steam not a stagnant pool the pursuit of happiness is in our constitution were all entitled to have the best we can see to do good and you will find that happiness will run after you to me flowers are happiness we all have to work for happiness and you cannot listen to other people that is the worst mistake you can make happiness consumes itself like a flame it cannot burn for ever it must go out and the presentiment of its end destroys it at its very peak money cant buy happiness marriage is wild i thought it was this perfect land of happiness and joy wrong after you say you do you dont for a long time if you can measure success in this business based on happiness alone i feel like ive hit the lottery experienced happiness refers to your feelings to how happy you are as you live your life in contrast the satisfaction of the remembering self refers to your feelings when you think about your life i believe economic growth should translate into the happiness and progress of all along with it there should be development of art and culture literature and education science and technology we have to see how to harness the many resources of india for achieving common good and for inclusive growth so i decided to move that scene in the doctors office to twothirds into the movie after the viewers had come to know ryan and ali and share in their happiness what happiness is there which is not purchased with more or less of pain if you asked somebody what do you wish for in life they wouldnt say happiness i would have answered excitement knowledge god knows  i mean many many different things but certainly not happiness it seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular as long as you understand that you find happiness through family friends and love then money is just a nice bonus 90 100 are going there to hear the singing the story is another thing nobodys interested in the story happiness is happiness even when there are times that were not happy happiness will creep in it is great happiness to be praised of them who are most praiseworthy law is stable the societies we are speaking of are progressive the greater or less happiness of a people depends on the degree of promptitude with which the gulf is narrowed in my life ive learned that true happiness comes from giving helping others along the way makes you evaluate who you are i think that love is what were all searching for i havent come across anyone who didnt become a better person through love the truth is that relative income is not directly related to happiness nonpartisan socialsurvey data clearly show that the big driver of happiness is earned success a persons belief that he has created value in his life or the life of others i dont know why my smile has become a signature pose i think its a nice change i think people want to see happiness so a smile is what can bring that i didnt make it my trademark on purpose happiness is when you love who you are and you are able to accept yourself and others it is the people who can do nothing who find nothing to do and the secret to happiness in this world is not only to be useful but to be forever elevating ones uses clothes are my drug i love camden market  i have so many vintage pieces from there its unbelievable clothes are really important to me they give me that feeling of happiness i love being a bit free with it all and not giving myself rules since therefore no man is born without faults and he is esteemed the best whose errors are the least let the wise man consider everything human as connected with himself for in worldly affairs there is no perfect happiness under heaven the thing is when i had my first success it did coincide with the end of my first marriage and because i went on to have a very very unhappy two years i dont think i equate career success with personal happiness we hear of the wealth of nations of the powers of production of the demand and supply of markets and we forget that these words mean no more if they mean any thing then the happiness and the labor and the necessities of men that which makes people dissatisfied with their condition is the chimerical idea they form of the happiness of others with respect to the first of these obstacles it has often been made a matter of grave complaint against political economists that they confine their attention to wealth and disregard all consideration of happiness or virtue ive done an informal anecdotal survey about marriage and ive found no evidence that it brings happiness i find happiness comes from numerous sources in my life most often the happy moments i cherish most are quiet moments with my wife and family back home in nova scotia the applause was so loud and insistent that i had to respond with several encores i was numb with happiness when it was over i knew that this alone must be my life and my world although one may fail to find happiness in theatrical life one never wishes to give it up after having once tasted its fruits my grandmother had six kids  one died as an infant  and she was dirtpoor and all her kids got an education and my mom grew up poor and they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness i wanted to have that like an amulet not like armor but like a magic feather like dumbos magic feather the path i am trying so hard to follow is in fact the one that god my father and his son jesus christ want me to pursue it has brought me deep happiness this is why i belong and why i believe i commend to all this same search for happiness and for the truth heaven takes care that no man secures happiness by crime to comprehend the wisdom of this injunction the better and explain the duty before us it should be considered that government is the only means by which human happiness can be attained if we did not look to marriage as the principal source of happiness fewer marriages would end in tears the fabric of north carolina and what makes our state so special is our families and our common desire for a brighter future for our children no matter what your family looks like we all want the same thing for our families  happiness health prosperity a bright future for our children and grandchildren we have arrived at that point of time in which we are forced to see our own humiliation as a nation and that a progression in this line cannot be a productive of happiness private or public every moment of your life that is not a complete nightmare is happiness eternal principles that govern happiness apply equally to all i think i am missing a gene that most people have to enable them to feel happiness about success and these kind of things happiness a way station between too little and too much when i first found out that i was an idol finalist i cried tears of happiness i was just so happy and my family was there and the fact that got to see that moment and share that moment with me was just everything to me from the taoist point of view the natural result of this harmonious way of living is happiness the secular world looks to the church and to its chagrin finds no love no life no laughter no hope and no happiness by mere burial man arrives not at bliss and in the future life throughout its whole infinite range they will seek for happiness as vainly as they sought it here who seek it in aught else than that which so closely surrounds them here  the infinite sitting behind the bench at games is the hardest thing ive ever had to go through because basketball is really most of my happiness so when i cant go out there and exert energy and have fun and things like that it kind of puts everything else into perspective in civilized life where the happiness and indeed almost the existence of man depends on the opinion of his fellow men he is constantly acting a studied part i knew everything and received everything but real happiness is giving i always remembered that when i saw people get married they got on a rocketship and went to planet happiness population them some of you read with me 40 years ago a portion of aristotles ethics a selection of passages that describe his idea of happiness you may not remember too well the last part the part youre now approaching was for aristotle the most important for happiness happiness is not a matter of events it depends upon the tides of the mind the only real happiness a ballplayer has is when he is playing a ball game and accomplishes something he didnt think he could do we pray that every field of science may contribute in bringing happiness  not disaster  to human beings happiness is only real when shared and in fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources contributes to unhappiness but the increase in material resources do not increase happiness i love being on stage im completely totally relaxed its the only time in my life when i know where i am and whats coming next the other robert powell is probably fairly melancholic lets just say happiness isnt my default position there are dark parts im very good at it i frighten people sometimes hope is itself a species of happiness and perhaps the chief happiness which this world affords id rather have happiness than money people ask for it sometimes when i dont have it i make other peoples problems my problem because they want me to they ask me to so many people equate money and success with happiness especially in the music industry let us never know what old age is let us know the happiness time brings not count the years five or six hundred heads cut off would have assured your repose freedom and happiness i say there is not more happiness for me than the freedom of my homeland your destiny is my destiny your happiness is my happiness i learned that people everywhere are basically the same and have similar goals that we do they want health and happiness and the opportunity to provide for their families there is nothing can pay one for that invaluable ignorance which is the companion of youth those sanguine groundless hopes and that lively vanity which makes all the happiness of life a face is too slight a foundation for happiness we are selling dreams we are merchants of happiness the gods conceal from men the happiness of death that they may endure life lots of people i know have bootlegged tapes of performances and if they play it i will be transported back sometimes with happiness sometimes with horror too much good fortune can make you smug and unaware happiness should be like an oasis the greener for the desert that surrounds it happiness is realizing that nothing is too important no true and permanent fame can be founded except in labors which promote the happiness of mankind no period of my life has been one of such unmixed happiness as the four years which have been spent within college walls religion is of general and public concern and on its support depend in great measure the peace and good order of government the safety and happiness of the people it is not only my laboratory and my place of work but also my home so that on the 30th october i was able to share my happiness immediately with my students and collaborators and at the same time with my wife and family when the honour is given to that scientist personally the happiness is sweet indeed science is on the whole an informal activity a life of shirt sleeves and coffee served in beakers the crown of life is neither happiness nor annihilation it is understanding happiness is the sublime moment when you get out of your
