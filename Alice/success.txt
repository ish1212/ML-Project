interest and enjoyment a household of children if things go reasonably well certainly all other forms of success and achievement lose their importance by comparison our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan in which we must fervently believe and upon which we must vigorously act there is no other route to success the path to success is to take massive determined action america is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen but i am afraid it is not going to be a success tell me why is the media here so negative why are we in india so embarrassed to recognise our own strengths our achievements we are such a great nation we have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them why success is often achieved by those who dont know that failure is inevitable my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an african name barack or blessed believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success focused hard work is the real key to success keep your eyes on the goal and just keep taking the next step towards completing it if you arent sure

constant success must change his conduct with the times there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things no man ever achieved worthwhile success who did not at one time or other find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure personality is the most important thing to an actresss success success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence the extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning the key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear there is no force like success and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it as of the individual so should it be of the nation success is getting what you want happiness is liking what you get success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best theres no abiding success without commitment success is peace of mind which is a direct result of selfsatisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable if you wish to be a success in the world promise everything deliver nothing there is probably a perverse pride in my administration that we were going to do the right thing even if shortterm it was unpopular and i think anybody whos occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you cant be neglecting of marketing and pr and public opinion i do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance it overcomes almost everything even nature one man cannot practice many arts with success you know you are on the road to success if you would do your job and not be paid for it an artist cannot fail it is a success to be one my success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense i stand ready to lead us down a different path where were lifted up by our desire to succeed not dragged down by a resentment of success you grow up a bit damaged or broken then you have some success but you dont know how to feel good about the work youre doing or the life youre leading the ladder of success is never crowded at the top if you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons if you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow halfhearted success that breeds bitterness all around anything that wont sell i dont want to invent its sale is proof of utility and utility is success you might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself a rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success i do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success such emotions make a man forget food sleep friends love everything the battle of life is in most cases fought uphill and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honor if there were no difficulties there would be no success if there were nothing to struggle for there would be nothing to be achieved the central conservative truth is that it is culture not politics that determines the success of a society the central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall forward as occasion offers never look round to see whether any shall note it be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter and think that even such a result is no trifle were constantly striving for success fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about you never achieve success unless you like what you are doing men of age object too much consult too long adventure too little repent too soon and seldom drive business home to the full period but content themselves with a mediocrity of success a constant struggle a ceaseless battle to bring success from inhospitable surroundings is the price of all great achievements ask yourself the secret of your success listen to your answer and practice it the key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life  mental emotional spiritual as well as physical obstacles are necessary for success because in selling as in all careers of importance victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats you do the work and you want people to see it but um while im doing the work the result doesnt matter at all to me ultimately i dont i dont care whether the film is  you know  some big giant boxoffice bonanza and i dont care if its a complete flop to me when a film gets made and its actually finished its a success theyre all a success in their own way if a man loves the labour of his trade apart from any question of success or fame the gods have called him there is little success where there is little laughter it is not the going out of port but the coming in that determines the success of a voyage if we become one of those societies that attack success why not come as certain there will be a lot less success and thats not who we are that business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great american success story success is not greedy as people think but insignificant that is why it satisfies nobody i must admit that i personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to her or his fellow human beings the ability to convert ideas to things is the secret of outward success in all our deeds the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure achievement is not always success while reputed failure often is it is honest endeavor persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances success is dangerous one begins to copy oneself and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others it leads to sterility success is full of promise till one gets it and then it seems like a nest from which the bird has flown perseverance is a great element of success if you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody everyone who achieves success in a great venture solves each problem as they came to it they helped themselves and they were helped through powers known and unknown to them at the time they set out on their voyage

taught to value everyones contribution and treat everyone with respect procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy perseverance  a lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success success in life is founded upon attention to the small things rather than to the large things to the every day things nearest to us rather than to the things that are remote and uncommon our limitations and success will be based most often on your own expectations for ourselves what the mind dwells upon the body acts upon if a man

from a council estate or a country estate your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude the season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success it is only the cynicism that is born of success that is penetrating and valid always remember that striving and struggle precede success even in the dictionary no one succeeds without effort those who succeed owe their success to perseverance the road to success is always under construction raising children is an uncertain thing success is reached only after a life of battle and worry if you work just for money youll never make it but if you love what youre doing and you always put the customer first success will be yours along with success comes a reputation for wisdom its very easy for me to say what success is i think success is connecting with an audience who understands you and having a dialogue with them i think success is continuing to push yourself forward creatively and not sort of becoming a caricature of yourself i can honestly say that i was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking if i felt it was the right thing to do i was for it regardless of the possible outcome when you see something that is technically sweet you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success that is the way it was with the atomic bomb hope is a state of mind not of the world hope in this deep and powerful sense is not the same as joy that things are going well or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success but rather an ability to work for something because it is good honesty is the cornerstone of all success without which confidence and ability to perform shall cease to exist success or failure in business is caused more by the mental attitude even than by mental capacities success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal theres no secret about success did you ever know a successful man who didnt tell you about it there is no success without hardship willpower is the key to success successful people strive no matter what they feel by applying their will to overcome apathy doubt or fear im not after fame and success and fortune and power its mostly that i want to have a good job and have good friends thats the good stuff in life success follows doing what you want to do there is no other way to be successful it is wise to keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final after my spectacular failures i could not be satisfied with an ordinary success a desire to be in charge of our own lives a need for control is born in each of us it is essential to our mental health and our success that we take control ive been so fortunate in my life that my family has never been jealous of my success they have shown true love and commitment to me by being supportive they shared in it in hollywood a marriage is a success if it outlasts milk whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained progress stops i am doomed to an eternity of compulsive work no set goal achieved satisfies success only breeds a new goal the golden apple devoured has seeds it is endless mohammed was not an apparent failure he was a dazzling success politically as well as spiritually and islam went from strength to strength to strength no experience is a cause of success or failure we do not suffer from the shock of our experiences socalled trauma  but we make out of them just what suits our purposes the freedom to fail is vital if youre going to succeed most successful people fail from time to time and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success success in any endeavor depends on the degree to which it is an expression of your true self to have long term success as a coach or in any position of leadership you have to be obsessed in some way be yourself follow your instincts success depends at least in part on the ability to carry it off failure is only postponed success as long as courage coaches ambition the habit of persistence is the habit of victory the compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter in the best sense one stays young however things may seem no evil thing is success and no good thing is failure ive learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success success is not in what you have but who you are education is the key to success in life and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students desire is the key to motivation but its the determination and commitment to unrelenting pursuit of your goal  a commitment to excellence  that will enable you to attain the success you seek i did standup comedy for 18 years ten of those years were spent learning four years were spent refining and four years were spent in wild success i was seeking comic originality and fame fell on me as a byproduct the course was more plodding than heroic we learn wisdom from failure much more than from success we often discover what will do by finding out what will not do and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery when it comes to success there are no shortcuts the decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success it is not intelligent it is not beautiful it is not just it is not virtuous and it doesnt deliver the goods for true success ask yourself these four questions why why not why not me why not now no student ever attains very eminent success by simply doing what is required of him it is the amount and excellence of what is over and above the required that determines the greatness of ultimate distinction when i prayed for success i forgot to ask for sound sleep and good digestion the world judge of men by their ability in their profession and we judge of ourselves by the same test for it is on that on which our success in life depends success seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistakes but they dont quit success is a beast and it actually puts the emphasis on the wrong thing you get away with more instead of looking within while i was doing standup i thought i knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me so i became whoever i thought people wanted me to be id say yes when i wanted to say no and i even wore a few dresses whether a party can have much success without a woman present i must ask others to decide but one thing is certain no party is any fun unless seasoned with folly keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final when i finish a picture i dont show it to anyone if i feel its not good enough yet ive learnt to listen to my partners and my friends for me its the biggest success if they like it the secret of my success is a two word answer know people im hopeful i know there is a lot of ambition in washington obviously but i hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure the concept of the good ol days must be one of our societys biggest delusions top reasons for depression as well as most often used excuse for lack of success a government for the people must depend for its success on the intelligence the morality the justice and the interest of the people themselves enjoy your sweat because hard work doesnt guarantee success but without it you dont have a chance never mind what others do do better than yourself beat your own record from day to day and you are a success success is where preparation and opportunity meet for success attitude is equally as important as ability if success is a habit it is a hard one to acquire enjoying success requires the ability to adapt only by being open to change will you have a true opportunity to get the most from your talent we must believe in luck for how else can we explain the success of those we dont like the more defects a man may have the older he is the less lovable the more resounding his success the only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves on the other an artist must never be a prisoner prisoner an artist should never be a prisoner of himself prisoner of style prisoner of reputation prisoner of success etc my success and my misfortunes the bright and the dark days i have gone through everything has proved to me that in this world either physical or moral good comes out of evil just as well as evil comes out of good the ladder of success in hollywood is usually a press agent actor director producer leading man and you are a star if you sleep with each of them in that order crude but true success in training the boy depends largely on the scoutmasters own personal example thats the definition of success for the modern democrat party as many people dependent on government as possible is the objective remember you will not always win some days the most resourceful individual will taste defeat but there is in this case always tomorrow  after you have done your best to achieve success today failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor success is only meaningful and enjoyable if it feels like your own men judge us by the success of our efforts god looks at the efforts themselves the power of fortune is confessed only by the miserable for the happy impute all their success to prudence or merit i have always been pushed by the negative the apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night before the reviews are out i am more compelled to get back to work than if i had a success we are taught to consume and thats what we do but if we realized that there really is no reason to consume that its just a mind set that its just an addiction then we wouldnt be out there stepping on peoples hands climbing the corporate ladder of success but while success and failure depend on conditions the mind neither waxes nor wanes no one can possibly achieve any real and lasting success or get rich in business by being a conformist think of success as a game of chance in which you have control over the odds as you begin to master concepts in personal achievement you are increasing your odds of achieving success success is about enjoying what you have and where you are while pursuing achievable goals from success you get a lot of things but not that great inside thing that love brings you i want anyone who believes in life liberty pursuit of happiness to succeed and i want any force any person any element of an overarching big government that would stop your success i want that organization that element or that person to fail i want you to succeed dont think of it as failure think of it as timereleased success i hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life i dont think about my previous success im happy that the work ive done has been very successful success is a journey not a destination the doing is often more important than the outcome nobody travels on the road to success without a puncture or two the first requisite for success is the ability to apply your physical and mental energies to one problem incessantly without growing weary constant success shows us but one side of the world adversity brings out the reverse of the picture success and failure are equally disastrous luxury is the wolf at the door and its fangs are the vanities and conceits germinated by success when an artist learns this he knows where the danger is success isnt permanent and failure isnt fatal whether in success or in failure im proud of every single movie ive ever directed ambition is the path to success persistence is the vehicle you arrive in anyone who wants to sell you overnight success or wealth is not interested in your success they are interested in your money everything you need for better future and success has already been written and guess what all you have to do is go to the library the two most important requirements for major success are first being in the right place at the right time and second doing something about it singleness of purpose is one of the chief essentials for success in life no matter what may be ones aim success  keeping your mind awake and your desire asleep think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success a whole clear glorious life lies before you achieve achieve our purpose in vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression it is not conquest it is not empire it is not foreign bases it is not domination it is simply put just to prevent the forceful conquest of south vietnam by north vietnam talent alone wont make you a success neither will being in the right place at the right time unless you are ready the most important question is are your ready like so many american families our families werent asking for much they didnt begrudge anyone elses success or care that others had much more than they did in fact they admired it success is the sum of small efforts  repeated day in and day out most success springs from an obstacle or failure i became a cartoonist largely because i failed in my goal of becoming a successful executive success is getting and achieving what you want happiness is wanting and being content with what you get on receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided on my illustrious predecessor and which he has discharged so faithfully and so well i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success for an actress to be a success she must have the face of venus the brains of a minerva the grace of terpsichore the memory of a macaulay the figure of juno and the hide of a rhinoceros the level of our success is limited only by our imagination and no act of kindness however small is ever wasted i dont know what keeps me going sometimes i wonder i think its just pure perseverance and wanting to succeed and having that burning desire to always have success success should always be just beyond your grasp in the united states theres a puritan ethic and a mythology of success he who is successful is good in latin countries in catholic countries a successful person is a sinner success took me to her bosom like a maternal boa constrictor temporary success can be achieved in spite of lack of other fundamental qualities but no advancements can be maintained without hard work honesty is the most single most important factor having a direct bearing on the final success of an individual corporation or product when success comes people can try to trick you or take advantage of you no man is a success in business unless he loves his work i was motivated by just thinking that if you had all this external success that everyone would love you and everything would be peaceful and wonderful its not just the grammys that ive pulled out of i also pulled out of the english awards as well the reason that i wanted to pull out was because i believe very much that the music industry as a whole is mainly concerned with material success it is on our failures that we base a new and different and better success success is a consequence and must not be a goal personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement all success all achievement in real life grows an actors popularity is fleeting his success has the life expectancy of a small boy who is about to look into a gas tank with a lighted match give me a couple of years and ill make that actress an overnight success ill tell you there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer i believe that success can happen at any time and at any age youve achieved success in your field when you dont know whether what youre doing is work or play success is survival the appreciative smile the chuckle the soundless mirth so important to the success of comedy cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it your success depends mainly upon what you think of yourself and whether you believe in yourself the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success after a lifetime of working raising families and contributing to the success of this nation in countless other ways senior citizens deserve to retire with dignity there is much to be said for failure it is much more interesting than success to get down to the quick of it respect motivates me  not success success is sweet and sweeter if long delayed and gotten through many struggles and defeats i believe in luck how else can you explain the success of those you dislike the will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success the most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion failure is simply the nonpresence of success but a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions let us realize that the privilege to work is a gift the power to work is a blessing the love of work is success ive stopped apologizing to myself for having this great period of success and financial acceptance people fall forward to success within the us the obama presidency will be mainly measured by the success or failure of his economic policies and here i fear the monstrous stimulus package with which this administration stumbled out of the gate will prove to be obamas waterloo i define success as being comfortable with yourself and your life and that is about as good as it gets really the person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy inevitable part of the process of getting to the top think little goals and expect little achievements think big goals and win big success why be a man when you can be a success i have no time for those who say there is no way scotland could go it alone i know firsthand the contribution scotland and scots make to britains success  so for me theres no question about whether scotland could be an independent nation hopefully ill continue to have the success ive had the thing you dont dream about as a kid is all the peripheral stuff that comes with success the reward of art is not fame or success but intoxication that is why so many bad artists are unable to give it up providence has nothing good or high in store for one who does not resolutely aim at something high or good a purpose is the eternal condition of success we are a people that have always celebrated other peoples success so long as we always had the opportunity to meet that success ourselves that is the american nature that is the american character that is one of the things that makes us different from the rest of the world and im afraid we could lose that or are on the verge of losing that if you want to be truly successful invest in yourself to get the knowledge you need to find your unique factor when you find it and focus on it and persevere your success will blossom i hate to be a failure i hate and regret the failure of my marriages i would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success the prospect of success in achieving our most cherished dream is not without its terrors who is more deprived and alone than the man who has achieved his dream if god has made the world a perfect mechanism he has at least conceded so much to our imperfect intellect that in order to predict little parts of it we need not solve innumerable differential equations but can use dice with fair success im an eternal realist and the success rate for being an actor is pretty low success has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself its what you do for others for someone whos had the level of success ive had theres been very little critical review of my work which is pretty fascinating rock and roll is still asking people like me to live up to the old guards concept of what success is but it doesnt mean anything there could be no honor in a sure success but much might be wrested from a sure defeat it was so draining going to parties to rub elbows with soandso and act like its no big deal when really all i was doing was hoping id have the success they had im either going to go completely mental completely bankrupt or have the best success of my life one fails forward toward success were not uncomfortable with it and weve already been through enough of the music business where im not really worried that commercial success is going to in some way  were already past saving you know what i mean its too late for us success represents the 1 of your work which results from the 99 that is called failure the worst part of success is to try finding someone who is happy for you the making of friends who are real friends is the best token we have of a mans success in life some of the best lessons we ever learn are learned from past mistakes the error of the past is the wisdom and success of the future permanent success cannot be achieved except by incessant intellectual labour always inspired by the ideal i worked half my life to be an overnight success and still it took me by surprise the danger of success is that it makes us forget the worlds dreadful injustice for a good 10 to 12 years i was working nonstop and i wasnt really enjoying my success i think all those people i did stories about measured their own success by the joy their work was giving them the media says that equality for women has arrived but if you look around you still dont see girls playing guitars and having success with it the keys to brand success are selfdefinition transparency authenticity and accountability refuse to accept the belief that your professional relevance career success or financial security turns on the next update on the latest technology sometimes its good to put the paddle down and just let the canoe glide the secret of success is to be in harmony with existence to be always calm to let each wave of life wash us a little farther up the shore indeed i regard the enduring support which i have received over the years from all sections of the community in ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which i may have achieved as an actor no one is guaranteed happiness you can pursue it but if you happen to find success along the way on that road to happiness conservatives believe you should not be demonized or penalized for it success is never final but failure can be i am highly offended by the total lack of acknowledgement of my contribution to laker success if not for the success that medicine has made i might be part of a much different story right now democrats believe in reigniting the american dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all so everyone can succeed people are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal success is achieved by developing our strengths not by eliminating our weaknesses i cannot give you the formula for success but i can give you the formula for failure  which is try to please everybody hope is the companion of power and the mother of success for who so hopes has within him the gift of miracles when a small child i thought that success spelled happiness i was wrong happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment but soon flits away success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism failure is a part of success sometimes people take it for granted that they had success especially nowadays when you have instant stardom a lot of people feel entitlement and nobody is entitled to anything americas wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success take away their incentive with badmouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy you have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become uninterested in money compliments or publicity its ironic that at age 32 at probably the greatest moment of my career with the godfather having such an enormous success i wasnt even aware of it because i was somewhere else under the deadline again success is usually the culmination of controlling failure success is just being happy and i try so many different things i do a lot of different things because i think god has helped me to love myself i know who god is and i love god success is always something completely different to people i feel like ive succeeded if im doing something that makes me happy and im not lying to anybody the road to success is always under construction success for me its to raise happy healthy human beings my success was due to good luck hard work and support and advice from friends and mentors but most importantly it depended on me to keep trying after i had failed a minutes success pays the failure of years i believe there are three keys to success for me it is keeping my priorities in order its my faith and my family and then the business without an openminded mind you can never be a great success the five essential entrepreneurial skills for success are concentration discrimination organization innovation and communication youve got to eat while you dream youve got to deliver on shortrange commitments while you develop a longrange strategy and vision and implement it the success of doing both walking and chewing gum if you will getting it done in the shortrange and delivering a longrange plan and executing on that theres no right or wrong success or failure i always say be humble but be firm humility and openness are the key to success without compromising your beliefs i think people often confuse success with fame and stardom well certainly one of the ironies of the success of affirmative action is that the middle class within the black community no longer lives within black community by and large the historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination by itself would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction we also need intervention to promulgate a middleclass ethic of success among the poor while expanding opportunities for economic betterment i sort of understood that when i first started that you shouldnt repeat a success very often youre going to and maybe the first time you do it works and you love it but then youre trapped the very first step towards success in any occupation is to become interested in it about the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure positive thinking is the key to success in business education pro football anything that you can mention i go out there thinking that im going to complete every pass you really have to work hard and apply yourself and by applying yourself and working hard and being diligent you can achieve success success breeds complacency complacency breeds failure only the paranoid survive success is like a liberation or the first phrase of a love story so many stars lose their way and with success become more neurotic not less so it is a mistake to suppose that men succeed through success they much oftener succeed through failures precept study advice and example could never have taught them so well as failure has done success breeds success i always think im the tom cruise of music  a lot of success and fans but no critics darling like the british constitution she owes her success in practice to her inconsistencies in principle well success does not mean doing well remember i come from such an excessively overdone redcarpet place called hollywood so im used to people blowing up their success in ways that are far above and beyond the truth although in skating you compete with other people anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves and for me the idea that i could always do better learn more learn faster is something that came from skating but i carried that with me for the rest of my life success and failure are both part of life both are not permanent success cant be forced id rather have huge success and huge failures than travel in the middle of the road fathers and mothers have lost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children is for them to be wise specialized competence and success are all that they can imagine many individuals are doing what they can but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable success cannot come from standstill men methods change and men must change with them i wanted to highlight that whole dreadful process in book publishing that nothing succeeds like success the secret of our success is that we never never give up i think the success of democracy is not really police security its the presence of a broad middle class the stronger the middle class of a people is the less you have to worry about one group coming in and exploiting the democratic process for its own ends i wish i could just go tell all the young women i work with all these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success i wish i could tell that to my daughter but its not that simple its so interesting how success hits people and how they react to it i get hired by companies to hack into their systems and break into their physical facilities to find security holes our success rate is 100 weve always found a hole youve got to work hard for your success and youve got to have a steady presence thats the secret success always necessitates a degree of ruthlessness given the choice of friendship or success id probably choose success one of the rewards of success is freedom the ability to do whatever you like i want to swim in both directions at once desire success court failure breast cancer deaths in america have been declining for more than a decade much of that success is due to early detection and better treatments for women i strongly encourage women to get a mammogram i have a tendency to sabotage relationships i have a tendency to sabotage everything fear of success fear of failure fear of being afraid useless goodfornothing thoughts young man the secret of my success is that an early age i discovered that i was not god the framers of the constitution were so clear in the federalist papers and elsewhere that they felt an independent judiciary was critical to the success of the nation the great dream merchant disney was a success because makebelieve was what everyone seemed to need in a spiritually empty land well i think that theres a very thin dividing line between success and failure and i think if you start a business without financial backing youre likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line rockefeller once explained the secret of success get up early work late  and strike oil i dont dwell on success maybe thats one reason im successful success consists of getting up just one more time than you fall we need to accept that we wont always make the right decisions that well screw up royally sometimes  understanding that failure is not the opposite of success its part of success every soldier must know before he goes into battle how the little battle he is to fight fits into the larger picture and how the success of his fighting will influence the battle as a whole you know i start with the assumption that or with with the belief that this president has to succeed we all have an enormous amount of capital invested in his success his success is the countrys success i think the idea that you know who your inner self is on a daily basis because you know whats good for you 25 years ago may not be good for you now so to keep in touch with that i think thats the first ingredient for success because if youre a successful human being everything else is gravy i think without failure there is no sweetness in success theres no understanding of it in most things success depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed islam is a religion of success unlike christianity which has as its main image in the west at least a man dying in a devastating disgraceful helpless death we moved into the back made it into a little 50s sitting room and started to sell the records we had an immediate success for one thing these teddy boys were thrilled to buy the records i dont think success is harmful as so many people say rather i believe it indispensable to talent if for nothing else than to increase the talent obama is capable  as evidenced by his firstterm success with health care reform but mandatebuilding requires humility a trait not easily associated with him i always think when theres stuff that people dont like i always say that if i have another success ill enjoy it more but you dont really i think that the reason for my success is that i am really not aspirational i am inspirational in that the people at home feel like they can really relate to me american inventiveness and the desire to build developed because we were guaranteed the right to own our success nothing succeeds like the appearance of success it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him success isnt everything but it makes a man stand straight theres more to life than success and if you can try to be more wellrounded youll be able to enjoy your success more it wont own you or control you in new york everyones desperate for success desperate for money and desperate to be accepted but in london theyre more laid back about things like that success is always something completely different to people i feel like ive succeeded if im doing something that makes me happy and im not lying to anybody im not doing that now so i feel really good about myself this weird thing happens when youre in a movie that has some level of success people start offering you all kinds of things and they just expect you to do them because theyll be good for your career its not about the projects integrity or anything like that one measure of your success will be the degree to which you build up others who work with you while building up others you will build up yourself money does not guarantee success all those who are around me are the bridge to my success so they are all important for an actress to be a success she must have the face of a venus the brains of a minerva the grace of terpsichore the memory of a macaulay the figure of juno and the hide of a rhinoceros the art of effective listening is essential to clear communication and clear communication is necessary to management success the most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success the best revenge in the world is success an entrepreneur assumes the risk and is dedicated and committed to the success of whatever he or she undertakes entrepreneurs are risk takers willing to roll the dice with their money or reputation on the line in support of an idea or enterprise they willingly assume responsibility for the success or failure of a venture and are answerable for all its facets do business managers have a commitment to anything more than the success of their company and to making money it would be hard to say that they do indeed many business leaders deny that there is any conflict between selfinterest and the interests of all eventually with success i started to feel more and more isolated  like i didnt have a community of artists when you grow up in the music industry trying to be britney spears because thats what sells records and then you realize all i have to do is be myself i should have thought of that a long time ago it feels good to have success come from whats actually inside of you im sure not afraid of success and ive learned not to be afraid of failure the only thing im afraid of now is of being someone i dont like much i was very clear that i wanted to keep thor out of the rest of the marvel universe for no less than the first six issues and the success of the book i think speaks well to that decision liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family i planned my success i knew it was going to happen ive learned that success comes in a very prickly package whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you success and the art of making music are two different things for me with everything that is complex we learn if you dont learn then its an utter and abject failure if you do learn and youre able to apply that to the next situation then you take away a measure of success education is a fundamental principle of what made america a success we cant afford to throw any young people away i am not fighting for success just to get more beauty out of myself and share it with more people people think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face but its easy to be chewed up and spat out youve got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it to do a common thing uncommonly well brings success the only question to ask yourself is how much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve this success your chances of success in any undertaking can always be measured by your belief in yourself so much of a professional athletes success depends upon not necessarily the play itself but how he deals with always saying how you deal with good is just as important as how you deal with bad the secret of success is sincerity but no nation can base its survival and development on luck and prayers alone while its leadership fritters away every available opportunity for success and concrete achievement and in reality i dont think its a real documentary its more a story of her life its a story of survival its a story of the time in which she lived the story of success and failure success is following the pattern of life one enjoys most for marriage to be a success every woman and every man should have her and his own bathroom the end ive had great success being a total idiot the film is not a success until it makes money its only good when theres a dollar figure attached to the box office no one ever attains success by simply doing what is required of him they thought i was a success as soon as i started paying the bills the hardest thing to find in life is balance  especially the more success you have the more you look to the other side of the gate what do i need to stay grounded in touch in love connected emotionally balanced look within yourself my father was an immigrant who literally walked across europe to get out of russia he fought in world war i he was wounded in action my father was a great success even though he never had money he was a very determined man a great role model we create success or failure on the course primarily by our thoughts i feel lucky because i was a nerd which i talk about in the book but i had academic success so through that because thats what my parents put a great deal of value on i had a great childhood because i sort of fulfilled the expectations of being good at school my success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day the road to success is filled with women pushing their husbands along sometimes success will get in the way of maturity  at least temporarily anytime you play a team sport the success of the team really makes everything better its nice i had a lot of success from the start i never really was tested for long periods of time i got my first professional job while i was a senior in college i signed with the william morris agency before i graduated which is  you know like check it out im pretty young im only about 40 years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and its exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right i should just put it bluntly because were all sort of friends here now  its exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me oh so jesus what a thought you know thats the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine oclock in the morning and i dont want to go there when somebody has an enormous success in this culture people start asking two questions which are what are you doing now and how are you going to beat that and i have to say i love the assumption that your intention is to beat yourself constantly  that youre in battle against yourself my career started young and i was really ambitious and then i had success and i hung out with people who were much older i think i might have been temporally misplaced so i thought i was 40 it was a premature midlife crisis the only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be i believe success is preparation because opportunity is going to knock on your door sooner or later but are you prepared to answer that youll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure the manic pursuit of success cost me everything i could love my wife my three children some friends i would have liked to grow old with the success of the rat pack or the clan was due to the camaraderie the three guys who work together and kid each other and love each other real success is not on the stage but off the stage as a human being and how you get along with your fellow man everyone has determination  its a question of how you use it hers is based on power and success and conquering she doesnt care what she has to do or who gets hurt in the process in that way were very very different a lot of football success is in the mind you must believe you are the best and then make sure that you are muslims must believe that all power success and victory comes from god alone once you have a lot of success you become a target in many ways without arthurs voice i never would have enjoyed that success a tragic irony of life is that we so often achieve success or financial independence after the chief reason for which we sought it has passed away theres not an instruction manual on how to deal with success so you just have to rely on having great friends and a good team success is measured by your discipline and inner peace the occupy movement needs an organizing principle and  just as the tea party did  it needs some actual measures of success choose one candidate whose agenda is squarely within that of the movement and make his or her electoral success a focal point in the end you make your reputation and you have your success based upon credibility and being able to provide people who are really hungry for information what they want youve got to ask asking is in my opinion the worlds most powerful  and neglected  secret to success and happiness despite the success cult men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of the effort involved in getting there  or failing to get there my college degree was in theater but the real reason if i have any success in that milieu so to speak is because i spent a lot of years directing i spent a lot of years behind the camera real success is being totally indulgent about your own trip you put your blinders on about the garbage and go full speed ahead do something you really like and hopefully it pays the rent as far as im concerned thats success success is more dangerous than failure the ripples break over a wider coastline nearly all monster stories depend for their success on jack killing the giant beowulf or st george slaying the dragon harry potter triumphing over the basilisk that is their inner grammar and the whole shape of the story leads towards it i think you can have moderate success by copying something else but if you really want to knock it out of the park you have to do something different and take chances as you walk in gods divine wisdom you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life i didnt have a whole lot of success getting dates i was always a bit of a geek success is the sweetest revenge you can never be comfortable with your success youve got to be paranoid youre going to lose it success needs no explanation failure does not have one that matters it sounds cliche but success is your friends your family what you do and if youre happy when you wake up success on any major scale requires you to accept responsibility in the final analysis the one quality that all successful people have is the ability to take on responsibility the only thing i can say about having this type of success is that you can get yourself in trouble because basically the world is set open for you people will say yes to anything you ask so its basically down to you and what you want or need your success story is a bigger story than whatever youre trying to say on stage success makes life easier it doesnt make living easier it takes two to make a marriage a success and only one to make it a failure the first principle of success is desire  knowing what you want desire is the planting of your seed dont be afraid of failure be afraid of petty success because after my first year i had a lot of success took everybody by storm came back the next year thought it was easy and didnt have near the season i had the previous year it was kind of a wakeup call and so life goes on married couples who work together to build and maintain a business assume broad responsibilities not only is their work important to our local and national economies but their success is central to the wellbeing of their families hiphop is more about attaining wealth people respect success they respect big they dont even have to like your music if youre big enough people are drawn to you true leadership lies in guiding others to success in ensuring that everyone is performing at their best doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well modesty should be typical of the success of a champion i will not be discouraged by failure i will not be elated by success follow your passion nothing  not wealth success accolades or fame  is worth spending a lifetime doing things you dont enjoy everybody loves success but they hate successful people by far the most important factor in the success or failure of any school far more important than tests or standards or businessmodel methods of accountability is simply attracting the besteducated most exciting young people into urban schools and keeping them there there is never just one thing that leads to success for anyone i feel it always a combination of passion dedication hard work and being in the right place at the right time philanthropy is the thing that i am really excited about and having success means i can do more there is no scientific answer for success you cant define it youve simply got to live it and do it the secret to success is to own nothing but control everything its the quality of the ordinary the straight the square that accounts for the great stability and success of our nation its a quality to be proud of but its a quality that many people seem to have neglected we do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is the x factor luck is great but most of life is hard work we do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work the problem with being british i dont know if its me being british or being raised a strict catholic but you never really enjoy success when humor can be made to alternate with melancholy one has a success but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time its just wonderful success makes you less intimidated by things people still dont appreciate how ephemeral success is i think that the entertainment industry itself has a history of chasing success any time a hit product comes out all the other companies start chasing after that success and trying to recreate it by putting out similar products it would be a joy for me if someone who was working with me became a big success in america as opposed to the old country success was based on merit but i like not these great success of yours for i know how jealous are the gods i think the measure of your success to a certain extent will be the amount of things written about you that arent true success means having the courage the determination and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be i havent deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies in fact its probably been quite the opposite after the success of the mask i wasnt offered all that many blonde bombshell parts to be honest i think people believed from the beginning that i could actually walk and talk at the same time yes i have made a lot of money and i have a lot of respect my films have done well and i know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me i really just thought this is like a strange dream i have never thought this is a success  i dont have a standard all of us are born for a reason but all of us dont discover why success in life has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself its what you do for others my own early experiences in war led me to suspect the value of discipline even in that sphere where it is so often regarded as the first essential for success when people stand up and talk about the great success that the eu has been im not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore i didnt have any success in show business until i was 30 to 31 years of age the nfl has been an amazing page in this chapter of my life i pray that all successive adventures offer me the same potential for growth success and most importantly fun as my father used to tell me the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy am i coasting on some early success yeah it was a good lucky break for me but i would rather earn my way back again than simply conform to what people are expecting one goes through school college medical school and ones internship learning little or nothing about goodness but a good deal about success the secrets of success are a good wife and a steady job my wife told me hollywood a city i was to come back to time and again in sickness and in health in success and in failure with anticipation and with dread but i think its more normal for my team to have no success than it is to win two consecutive european cups im not a defender of old or new football managers i believe in good ones and bad ones those that achieve success and those that dont i suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate ive had a lot of success ive had failures so i learn from the failure lesson from patakis success is use the political moment i realise that i do not change the course of history i am an actor i do a movie thats the end of it you have to realise we are just clowns for hire after i had success it was great at first not to worry about money it was on my mind when i was growing up i rejected the notion that my race or sex would bar my success in life success depends almost entirely on how effectively you learn to manage the games two ultimate adversaries the course and yourself im glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable they saw me hit this great success it was a blast and we had a lot of laughs and it was just an amazing time they passed away and then after i got you know famous all these haters came out of nowhere the one thing that makes me feel super lucky about my financial success is that i have a housekeeper if i wasnt even famous or had any success i would still wake up and put tons of makeup on and put on a cool outfit thats always been who ive been my whole life so thats never gonna change i love fashion i love getting dressed up i love halloween too success consists in being successful not in having potential for success any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace but theres no palace till its built the quick success was a bit strange to get used to in a way a certain amount of selfcriticism is a good thing because it keeps you humble realizing that no matter what success youve achieved you can still make enemies makes you humble too success is the necessary misfortune of life but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early success is not in never failing but rising everytime you fall i dont think about financial success as the measurement of my success excess is success sometimes because of my success i am afraid that i was not a good father with the first two i was too strong and with the other three i was too weak i feel like a hostage to fortune not that i am complaining i wanted to play the role but in truth i didnt think the show would be such a success ok i thought it would fail not because it was bad i was confident it was good but plenty of good things just sort of wither on the vine i admit i cant shake the idea that there is virtue in suffering that there is a sort of psychic economy whereby if you embrace success happiness and comfort these things have to be paid for its absolutely essential that we have the same safeguards that straight couples do but i want more than a 50 percent chance of success i dont want to emulate that i have more love success and security than i could ever dream of i see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire in fact i consider it integral to our success mechanism becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble if you must have it in order to be happy then you are denying the happiness of the here and now success is always temporary when all is said and one the only thing youll have left is your character when i meet successful people i ask 100 questions as to what they attribute their success to it is usually the same persistence hard work and hiring good people with believe bringing really big success for me outside of the uk for the first time it meant i have been touring around the world and that led to a gap from the studio i really feel like the gap has done me the world of good throughout that time i was able to collect songs that i really loved i have found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict adherence to the view that for you to gain those you deal with should gain as well like everybody i have invested in things that have gone bad because theres never any guarantee of success or profit when it comes to money when everything happens to you when youre so young youre very lucky but by the same token youre never going to have that same feeling again the first time anything happens to you  your first love your first success  the second one is never the same we all know that social security is one of this countrys greatest success stories in the 20th century enjoy failure and learn from it you can never learn from success in the digital age of overnight success stories such as facebook the hard slog is easily overlooked i went to america and got into a band had success had hits in australia yeah ideally id probably wish to be more anonymous but scrutiny and success go together and i want to be successful well i do feel that i carry the responsibility of representing my country wherever i am and this responsibility came with the success that i had in last couple of years not just myself but the whole group of tennis players that comes from serbia and athletes in general are in this moment the biggest ambassadors that our country has theres a lot of blood sweat and guts between dreams and success im not sure anybodys ready to see me in a drama and loving movies so much ive seen a lot of comics try to make that transition too fast and it can be detrimental and i dont think ive had as much success as i need in the comedy genre to open up those opportunities being best is a false goal you have to measure success on your own terms i want to make sure i dont interfere with the success of that team next year i dont see any way i could go to practice like most of em do and not hurt the team id go nuts if i tried doing that the success of any great moral enterprise does not depend upon numbers team gbs success at the beijing olympics can in part be said to have been made in manchester for example all the cycling medal winners trained at manchesters velodrome the national cycling centre for us political activists and candidates the morning after any election is a mix of emotions  the personal and the immediate the culmination of your own recent campaigning efforts and the fortunes of your party and the success or otherwise of what you stand for and believe in i never expected any sort of success with mockingbird i sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement ive learned its always better to have a small percentage of a big success than a hundred percent of nothing though i had success in my research both when i was mad and when i was not eventually i felt that my work would be better respected if i thought and acted like a normal person i dont think success arrives and youre suddenly happy its not like that if people think that theyll be very disappointed there is no middle ground in hollywood youre a failure or youre a success that mentality is wild i think the success of a talk show depends on how true it is to the personality of the person hosting it the shows i really admire like oprah and ellen are distinctively like their hosts so i think my show will be successful only if we try to stay consistent to my own sense of myself success will always be measured by the extent to which we serve the buying public anyone who has to fight even with the most modern weapons against an enemy in complete command of the air fights like a savage against modern european troops under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success to me success is choice and opportunity dullness in matters of government is a good sign and not a bad one  in particular dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence an indication of its success the kind of theater that i do is sort of narrative realism which i think in the broadest sense is legitimate to say is mainstream i mean in a certain sense suzanloris plays have had mainstream levels of success but suzanlori is in some ways not a narrative realist i was if you like a successful schoolboy in that i had a degree of talent in all the required things that make you a success at school success follows those adept at preserving the substance of the past by clothing it in the forms of the future my store wine library outsells big national chains how do you think we do it it started with hustle i always say that our success wasnt due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral but to the hours i spent talking to people online afterward making connections and building relationships i always say that the real success of wine library wasnt due to the videos i posted but to the hours i spent talking to people online afterward making connections and building relationships well you cant be trying to achieve success of any kind in this business without accepting that theres going to be a flip side to it hosting a tv show is a fulltime job in which success is defined by it never ending i think success has no rules but you can learn a great deal from failure success in the majority of circumstances depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed im starting to judge success by the time i have for myself the time i spend with family and friends my priorities arent amending theyre shifting a sign now of success with a certain audience when you do a short comedy piece anywhere is that it gets on youtube and gets around its always something youre thinking about unconsciously i mean we are tribal by nature and sometimes success and material wealth can divide and separate  its not a new philosophy im sharing  more than hardship hardship tends to unify in my time and neighborhood and in my soul there was only one standard by which a woman measured success did some man want her my definition of success is control if there is any secret to my success i think its that my characters are very real to me i feel everything they feel and therefore i think my readers care about them all business success rests on something labeled a sale which at least momentarily weds company and customer the whole secret to our success is being able to con ourselves into believing that were going to change the world because statistically we are unlikely to do it failures to heroic minds are the stepping stones to success how easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success evolution acts slowly our psychological characteristics today are those that promoted reproductive success in the ancestral environmen to be associated with success is absolutely wonderful success depends in a very large measure upon individual initiative and exertion and cannot be achieved except by a dint of hard work success produces confidence confidence relaxes industry and negligence ruins the reputation which accuracy had raised i was trying to uphold what i thought feminism was as best i could by supporting women by trying to create an opportunity to get women to get together play music together and celebrate the fact that we are having great success making music on our own and together if theres no fire theres no scream if theres no scream then no one hears you and no one comes to help you in the first place the depth of my struggle has definitely determined the height of my success to be able to teach my kids not just about success but about the struggle that comes with it put paying your dues and all that puts so much into being a success you have an understanding of what its about being on your own for three or four years and living day to day on 3 or living in an apartment with no electricity for example the equivalent of a woman being treated as a sex object is a man being treated as a success object the vampire was a complete change from the usual romantic characters i was playing but it was a success success sometimes can really bite you in the shorts with success came an evergrowing burden of responsibility i lived with a nearconstant lowlevel anxiety that i would make a mistake that would not only threaten my career but also my brothers  not to mention the livelihoods of many people who work with us or for us such a faith would be fatal to my reason to my liberty and even to the success of my undertakings it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave an instrument of the will and interests of others i passionately believe thats its not just what you say that counts its also how you say it  that the success of your argument critically depends on your manner of presenting it i was born with success lucky for me i am able to handle it also i damn well deserve it major success feels a bit like a coronation like id become a king i was one of the most famous people in the world loved and hated in equal measure i couldnt see anything bad with it it made me a happy person i think that everybody in the world whatever colour or creed has a jerk like jr in his or her family somewhere whether it is a father uncle cousin or brother everybody can identify with jr and that certainly had something to do with the success of dallas as his partner on this amazing journey i can tell you mitt romney was not handed success he built it sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth it is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character i gave up a lot of things in exchange for my success the success of watermark surprised me i never thought of music as something commercial it was something very personal to me thats the key to success isnt it it has to be fun theres that unwritten schism that literary writers get all the awards and commericals writers get all the success i think all of us certainly believed the statistics which said that probably 88 chance of mission success and maybe 96 chance of survival and we were willing to take those odds you know i can be the happiest man in the world with minimal record success i want to see success right away and i want to never give up never stop if you can go out with your live show and turn people on to that where you have that fan base thats religious and theyre going to come see you when youre in that town once your radio success is gone and youre not a mainstream guy anymore you can still go out and play your shows a man desires praise that he may be reassured that he may be quit of his doubting of himself he is indifferent to applause when he is confident of success success is not assured but america is resolute this is the best chance for peace we are likely to see for some years to come  and we are acting to help israelis and palestinians seize this chance when one has success the answer is not to undo that success it is to continue what has been done writers as they gain success feel like outsiders because writers dont come together in real groups firstperson narrators is the way i know how to write a book with the greatest power and chance of artistic success the first condition of success for the league of nations is therefore a firm understanding between the british empire and the united states of america and france and italy that there will be no competitive building up of fleets or armies between them one man has enthusiasm for 30 minutes another for 30 days but it is the man who has it for 30 years who makes a success of his life it never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business only to become a jerk you wanna know what scares people success when you dont make moves and when you dont climb up the ladder everybody loves you because youre not competition thought is the original source of all wealth all success all material gain all great discoveries and inventions and of all achievement it was a way out of poverty it was a way to success it was a way to education and it was a way to a brighter day for me i raised five children they all have different personalities all of them have different issues different levels of success that was a learning experience for me look if you ask a child would you rather have a fulfilled mother or a stayathome sylvia plath theyll pick sylvia plath every time but i think its really important that children dont feel their parents emotional lives depend on their success my literary success meant nothing to me i dont think success has changed us as people at all we are the same lunatics that we were when this band first got going we never see ourselves as being on a higher level than our fans the key to sitcom success is miserable people if you see a happy couple its just gone like when sam and diane got together on cheers if you can attribute your success entirely to your own mental effort to your own attitude to some spiritual essence that you have that is better than other peoples then that must feel pretty good the ever quickening advances of science made possible by the success of the human genome project will also soon let us see the essences of mental disease only after we understand them at the genetic level can we rationally seek out appropriate therapies for such illnesses as schizophrenia and bipolar disease success is the person who year after year reaches the highest limits in his field success is important only to the extent that it puts one in a position to do more things one likes to do we were called the toilets originally  we were flushed with success whenever i hear it cant be done i know im close to success it was very clear to me in 1965 in mississippi that as a lawyer i could get people into schools desegregate the schools but if they were kicked off the plantations  and if they didnt have food didnt have jobs didnt have health care didnt have the means to exercise those civil rights we were not going to have success success is finding satisfaction in giving a little more than you take we now live in a world where the only thing to have is success but failure is marvelous its fertiliser its like living fertiliser because youre forced on yourself without imagination we can go nowhere and imagination is not restricted to the arts every scientist i have met who has been a success has had to imagine everyone takes pause at 40 its the age you have to assess everything in your life its the fictitious marker thats always coming up when youre young the world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40 and be successful by 40 whatever success means my formula for success is rise early work late and strike oil winning in afghanistan is having a country that is stable enough to ensure that there is no safe haven for al qaida or for a militant taliban that welcomes al qaida thats really the measure of success for the united states im in the studio 24 hours a day its true that once you get a certain level of success you become a target talk magazine should be ashamed of themselves in a balanced organization working towards a common objective there is success one is never ready for success it consecrates and looses you at the same time its both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success i consider dr horrible a tremendous success the fact that it won an emmy i just think lends validity to what we were doing and the point we were trying to make taking the power into someone elses hands and changing the world but big oil and big coal have always been as skilled at propaganda as they are at mining and drilling like the tobacco industry before them their success depends on keeping americans stupid to burn always with this hard gemlike flame to maintain this ecstasy is success in life for movies to get greenlit solely based on the success of other movies that have a lot of women in them its so ridiculous to me i have decided to fight for my country because we have build a success story in guanajuato with real results and more yet to come in the next two years success tempts many to their ruin though i was excited about the sojourner truth play it was not reassuring to think that my entire future might depend on the success of that one show the real end winner of nafta is going to be mexico because we have the human capital we have that resource that is vital to the success of the us economy i feel true success comes from being able to work and the love for it people need to realise what real happiness and success is because success as an actor is fleeting you can be up there one day and gone the next my first attempt at a kiss was in fifth grade but it didnt go so well later i used boyz ii men and jodeci songs to come on to girls i had more success to this day most people think of me as the fastest human they dont really think me as a long jumper although thats the event i had more success in there is no correlation between a childhood success and a professional athlete mass communication radio and especially television have attempted not without success to annihilate every possibility of solitude and reflection id rather a young black actor read about success as opposed to how tough it was i get these roles because i can act and thats it hopefully thats it success is hard in general for most women we now have such busy lives and were told we can do everything  you know we can have the relationship and the marriage and the kids and the career four years of football are calculated to breed in the average man more of the ingredients of success in life than almost any academic course he takes ive had a lot of success over the years racing in new york but the main point is that i feel the marathon is a different event a lot more my event i did not become successful in my work through embracing or engaging in celebrity culture i never signed away my privacy in exchange for success the success of torn was a bit too much for me i took a year off and was still scared to start the second album happy people are ignoramuses and glory is nothing else but success and to achieve it one only has to be cunning you may lose your wife you may lose your dog your mother may hate you none of those things matter what matters is that you achieve success and become free then you can do whatever you like success is very ephemeral you depend entirely on the desire of others which makes it difficult to relax success comes in waves i cant imagine wanting to be famous just for the sake of being famous i think fame should come along with success talent we just want to win thats the bottom line i think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success but we dont really reflect on what weve done in the past we focus on the present there are so few women in general who arent completely threatened and confused by other womens success its very disappointing i dont understand why people whose entire lives or their corporate success depends on communication and yet they are led on occasion by ceos who cannot talk their way out of a paper bag and dont care to sometimes success comes in ways you dont expect i think that my biggest attribute to any success that i have had is hard work there really is no substitute for working hard you always pass failure on your way to success success listens only to applause to all else it is deaf theres nothing so aphrodisiacal for a woman as money and success the fhas success provides strong evidence that government can and should play a role in the nations mortgage finance system it also demonstrates that although government intervention in the economy during the great recession was messy things would have been a lot messier without it whatever success ive had i always like to top it were born with success it is only others who point out our failures and what they attribute to us as failure to win in australia for me has to be the ultimate success because the aussies live for sport a variety of national and international studies indicate that the broadbased deployment of information technology can have a substantial impact on our nations economic productivity and growth as well as the educational and social success of our citizens the fame of heroes owes little to the extent of their conquests and all to the success of the tributes paid to them all these people who say success changes people well no it just magnifies whats there success is not a destination but the road that youre on being successful means that youre working hard and walking your walk every day you can only live your dream by working hard towards it thats living your dream everyone applauds each others success in hollywood because they know how tough it is but it really comes down fundamentally to the process my ambition was to stop waiting tables that was how i measured success finally i was able to stop waiting tables and i was able to pay the rent and that was by being a standup comic not a very good standup comic but good enough to make a living i had come to the point when i realized it was unlikely that my film career was going to move beyond a certain level of role and i was  because i had graphic instances of it  handicapped by the success of star trek a director would say i dont want jeanluc picard in my movie  and this was compounded by xmen as well more people on unemployment benefits is not success in america fewer people on not because we kicked them off but because they have been able to get a job in the private sector because government got out of the way i think most people believe success in government is how many fewer people are in government not because you kick them off of benefits like unemployment but theyve been able to control their own destiny because private sector employers have created more jobs with the success of the last three or so years when a lot of people start treating you differently theres a danger that you may start to think of yourself differently you rely on your friends to say hey wake up if the film is a hit then everyone shares the success if it is going to be a disaster then it might as well be because of me not because of somebody else for the past few years i was the more visible asian performer and i think it gave young girls a kind of role model showing its possible to actually reach success doing movies i came from a family where i felt great pressure to be financially successful and i felt that staying in chicago and doing theater i was in all likelihood not going to find financial success for me i dont feel it is a success in the career to be the pretty woman career success comes from being characters who tell us something about the truth and really the basis i think of achieving some success in what i want to do today comes from my mothers push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education if i can procure three hundred good substantial names of persons or bodies or institutions i cannot fail to do well for my family although i must abandon my life to its success and undergo many sad perplexities and perhaps never see again my own beloved america ive always been too hard on myself to behave like ive arrived or even to enjoy whatever success ive had ive always envisioned myself higher than where i was and i still do with each success i think thats nice but im supposed to go there success is a process a quality of mind and way of being an outgoing affirmation of life for globalization to work for america it must work for working people we should measure the success of our economy by the breadth of our middle class and the scope of opportunity offered to the poorest child to climb into that middle class we had maybe the greatest success of any company that i know of in paris and after two or three years i wanted to do this same number that we did for pbs so we did it and paris had always considered us their darlings its hard for childrens authors to be accepted when they try to write adult books jk rowling is the exception because people are so eager to read anything by her but it took judy blume three or four tries before she had a success people of mediocre ability sometimes achieve outstanding success because they dont know when to quit most men succeed because they are determined to women face enough pressures and challenges in a workplace that is still depressingly biased against a females success add to that the fact that the very thing many women i know find most rewarding having kids is now frowned upon success is what you do with your ability its how you use your talent other peoples success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation ive always known i would be a success but i was surprised at the way it came nothing reinforces a professional relationship more than enjoying success with someone the first myth of management is that it exists the second myth of management is that success equals skill i dont want to wake up and be bored thats probably my greatest fear is to have nothing to do what better job is there than to play quarterback for an nfl team and certainly one that ive been on for a long time and had success with i dont plan on giving it up any time soon i thought doing reality tv would be the greatest success of my life or the biggest mistake nothing fails like success nothing is so defeated as yesterdays triumphant cause people repeat behaviour that leads to flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals the shortterm reward loop acts over hours to years and the longterm reproductive success loop over generations every success in limiting armaments is a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists and every such success thus supports the fight for international law and order success is 99 percent failure i have an idea of who i want to be i have a vision of my own success well i believe that the depth of your struggle can determine the height of your success i was inspired to come out of everything ive been through and end up in a place where i never thought that i would be success turns a lot of people off i have a pretty solid sense of joy and respect that irritates people and can irritate me too i always envisioned myself being a rapper and being in the game and having success but you never know what it feels like or how youre going to be when youre there girlfriend and 100 percent fun were my two peeks around 92 and 96 the reality is that the times i had the most media success sold lots of records and played bigger shows i had the least control of my own life i was successful materially but i know life is much more than worldly success i saw all these blessings god had given me the way to give thanks is obedience to god whenever you analyse anyone who has had any success and theyre in the headlines you will find they are human and make mistakes im certainly that and ive made a lot of mistakes at this point i cant say what network would be picking it up but i know that it would be a success i put pound150000 into the stage production of grease and have got back pound15 million so far it has been a fantastic success the only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion no one remembers anything else elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure i used to think that losing made you more hungry and determined but after my success at the olympics and the us open i realise that winning is the biggest motivation i dont like tommy on broadway at all i like the music im pleased with petes success but i dont like what theyve done to it picture yourself vividly as winning and that alone will contribute immeasurably to success my overnight success was really 15 years in the making id been writing songs since i was 6 and playing in bands and performing since i was 14 you should put time into learning your craft it seems like people want success so quickly way before theyre ready in hindsight i slid into arrogance based upon past success if you come into success too soon youll burn out and be finished before you know it if you let the maturation process happen naturally youll be happier with yourself in the end im a mum so my wardrobe consists of sweaters and jeans as long as i dont leave the house forgetting my jeans i count that as a fashion success im extremely ambitious i dont know why people are afraid to say that i wont sell my soul to the devil but i do want success and i dont think thats bad former olympians also get paid to make appearances many of them won their medals in an era when olympic success didnt go handinhand with financial success success comes to a writer as a rule so gradually that it is always something of a shock to him to look back and realize the heights to which he has climbed i just want to continue the success and be an athlete that is shown in a good light in new york city my wife elizabeth and i started the really terrible orchestra for people like us who are pretty hopeless musicians who would like to play in an orchestra it has been a great success we give performances weve become the most famous bad orchestra in the world i think people in botswana are pleased that my books paint a positive picture of their lives and portray the country as being very special theyve made a great success of their country and the people are fed up with the constant reporting of only the problems and poverty of the continent they welcome something which puts the positive side im astonished by my success its the price of success people start to think youre omnipotent the secret of my success is my hairspray success in whatever form it takes is a tricky thing  once youve achieved your goal then what where do you aim your chances of success are directly proportional to the degree of pleasure you desire from what you do if you are in a job you hate face the fact squarely and get out its nice being brought up with no money at all its just not how i measure success so that makes it a bunch easier taxation is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society the higher the tax level the greater the failure a centrally planned totalitarian state represents a complete defeat for the civilized world while a totally voluntary society represents its ultimate success immigrants provide skills that we simply cannot afford to do without they have contributed hugely to britains success independent films have a very different cachet than success films the delusions of selflove cannot be prevented but intellectual misconceptions as to the means of achieving success may be corrected i would love to be a guest on a talk show or a panel that shows women who have been on reality shows whove had success to prove to audiences that you dont have to be a fool to become successful when making music i sink myself into the process as deeply as i can and forget all of the success i think that everything you do helps you to write if youre a writer adversity and success both contribute largely to making you what you are if you dont experience either one of those youre being deprived of something the writing of a melody is an emotional moment success doesnt make it easy nothing good comes in life or athletics unless a lot of hard work has preceded the effort only temporary success is achieved by taking short cuts its an awesome responsibility not only to maintain the level of success the nfl has but to build on that fame and success are very different things its not just the nfl every other league has a draft it has been fundamental to the success of professional sports once you can accept failure you can have fun and success you can take elvis you can take marilyn monroe success and fame will not be the answer if something inside of you is bothering you if things in your mind arent going right
