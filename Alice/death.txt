a man who wont die for something is not fit to live to be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life foolish people are idle wise people are diligent the fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears for theres no risk of accident for someone whos dead the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time death is no more than passing from one room into another but theres a difference for me you know because in that other room i shall be able to see what we have done for ourselves alone dies with us what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal i didnt attend the funeral but i sent a nice letter saying i approved of it no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it is lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them while i thought that i was learning how to live i have been learning how to die life is hard then you die then they throw dirt in your face then the worms eat you be grateful it happens in that order suicide is mans way of telling god you cant fire me  i quit i saw few die of hunger of eating a hundred thousand death most resembles a prophet who is without honor in his own land or a poet who is a stranger among his people let no one weep for me or celebrate my funeral with mourning for i still live as i pass to and fro through the mouths of men the life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living the day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of eternity die v to stop sinning suddenly a friend who dies its something of you who dies no one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow they tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person i have never killed a man but i have read many obituaries with great pleasure for death is no more than a turning of us over from time to eternity a dying man needs to die as a sleepy man needs to sleep and there comes a time when it is wrong as well as useless to resist dying is easy its living that scares me to death death will be a great relief no more interviews i decided to devote my life to telling the story because i felt that having survived i owe something to the dead and anyone who does not remember betrays them again i am become death the destroyer of worlds ive told my children that when i die to release balloons in the sky to celebrate that i graduated for me death is a graduation those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body man always dies before he is fully born from my rotting body flowers shall grow and i am in them and that is eternity when youre dead youre dead thats it i had seen birth and death but had thought they were different death is a very dull dreary affair and my advice to you is to have nothing whatsoever to do with it because of indifference one dies before one actually dies millions long for immortality who dont know what to do with themselves on a rainy sunday afternoon call no man happy till he is dead do not fear death so much but rather the inadequate life cursed is the man who dies but the evil done by him survives a man does not die of love or his liver or even of old age he dies of being a man birth and death we all move between these two unknowns some people are so afraid do die that they never begin to live life is better than death i believe if only because it is less boring and because it has fresh peaches in it to himself everyone is immortal he may know that he is going to die but he can never know that he is dead pale death beats equally at the poor mans gate and at the palaces of kings men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased by tales so is the other since the day of my birth my death began its walk it is walking toward me without hurrying it is possible to provide security against other ills but as far as death is concerned we men live in a city without walls the dead cannot cry out for justice it is a duty of the living to do so for them the timing of death like the ending of a story gives a changed meaning to what preceded it of all the gods only death does not desire gifts tis very certain the desire of life prolongs it time rushes towards us with its hospital tray of infinitely varied narcotics even while it is preparing us for its inevitably fatal operation love and death are the two great hinges on which all human sympathies turn everything that gets born dies some men are alive simply because it is against the law to kill them the idea is to die young as late as possible death is the last enemy once weve got past that i think everything will be alright i shall not die of a cold i shall die of having lived all our knowledge merely helps us to die a more painful death than animals that know nothing healthy children will not fear life if their elders have integrity enough not to fear death nothing that is really good and godlike dies death borders upon our birth and our cradle stands in the grave any man who has 10000 left when he dies is a failure the words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living death is always around the corner but often our society gives it inordinate help man dies of cold not of darkness all architects want to live beyond their deaths he who doesnt fear death dies only once it was a time when only the dead smiled happy in their peace if you dont have any fight in you you might as well be dead even at our birth death does but stand aside a little and every day he looks towards us and muses somewhat to himself whether that day or the next he will draw nigh deaths in the goodbye for me habit is just a synonym for death he who is completely sanctified or cleansed from all sin and dies in this state is fit for glory we cannot banish dangers but we can banish fears we must not demean life by standing in awe of death when faith is lost when honor dies the man is dead john candy knew he was going to die he told me on his 40th birthday he said well maureen im on borrowed time hell madam is to love no longer death is the tyrant of the imagination the death of whats dead is the birth of whats living tradition demands that we not speak poorly of the dead fling but a stone the giant dies i do not agree with what you have to say but ill defend to the death your right to say it a nation or civilization that continues to produce softminded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan i love those who can smile in trouble who can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but they whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves their conduct will pursue their principles unto death people fear death even more than pain its strange that they fear death life hurts a lot more than death at the point of death the pain is over yeah i guess it is a friend if physical death is the price that i must pay to free my white brothers and sisters from a permanent death of the spirit then nothing can be more redemptive intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death without health life is not life it is only a state of langour and suffering  an image of death the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated even death is not to be feared by one who has lived wisely courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything  all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure  these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important do the thing you fear most and the death of fear is certain i am not afraid of death i just dont want to be there when it happens if you die youre completely happy and your soul somewhere lives on im not afraid of dying total peace after death becoming someone else is the best hope ive got i love the man that can smile in trouble that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death theres no tragedy in life like the death of a child things never get back to the way they were you can change your world by changing your words remember death and life are in the power of the tongue im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death i dont have no fear of death my only fear is coming back reincarnated there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws life is a process of becoming a combination of states we have to go through where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it this is a kind of death love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings the only difference between death and taxes is that death doesnt get worse every time congress meets death is a fearful thing the stroke of death is as a lovers pinch which hurts and is desired let us all be brave enough to die the death of a martyr but let no one lust for martyrdom fear of death makes us devoid both of valour and religion for want of valour is want of religious faith death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away i were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion one can survive everything nowadays except death and live down everything except a good reputation in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes the valiant never taste of death but once biography lends to death a new terror death may be the greatest of all human blessings i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge that myth is more potent than history that dreams are more powerful than facts that hope always triumphs over experience that laughter is the only cure for grief and i believe that love is stronger than death death comes to all but great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold for life and death are one even as the river and the sea are one i look upon death to be as necessary to our constitution as sleep we shall rise refreshed in the morning we are dying from overthinking we are slowly killing ourselves by thinking about everything think think think you can never trust the human mind anyway its a death trap in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart i simply cant build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion misery and death the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death death and life have their determined appointments riches and honors depend upon heaven an atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church an atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said an atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death he wants disease conquered poverty vanished war eliminated to run away from trouble is a form of cowardice and while it is true that the suicide braves death he does it not for some noble object but to escape some ill when your time comes to die be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way sing your death song and die like a hero going home life and death are one thread the same line viewed from different sides if we dont know life how can we know death do the thing we fear and death of fear is certain it is not death that a man should fear but he should fear never beginning to live if my survival caused another to perish then death would be sweeter and more beloved death is a challenge it tells us not to waste time it tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other the appeal of cinema lies in the fear of death each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death the kingdom of heaven is a condition of the heart  not something that comes upon the earth or after death whenever death may surprise us let it be welcome if our battle cry has reached even one receptive ear and another hand reaches out to take up our arms one death is a tragedy one million is a statistic let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life the living being is only a species of the dead and a very rare species ordinary people seem not to realize that those who really apply themselves in the right way to philosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death look i dont want to wax philosophic but i will say that if youre alive youve got to flap your arms and legs youve got to jump around a lot for life is the very opposite of death and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully or youre not alive there is no lonelier man in death except the suicide than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it people living deeply have no fear of death i postpone death by living by suffering by error by risking by giving by losing death is nothing but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily death is caused by swallowing small amounts of saliva over a long period of time the death of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into the deepest valleys look on them as your own beloved sons and they will stand by you even unto death i have thought there was some advantage even in death by which we mingle with the herd of common men at a formal dinner party the person nearest death should always be seated closest to the bathroom no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death life levels all men death reveals the eminent if you believe in god believe in death row east absence and death are the same  only that in death there is no suffering for centuries the death penalty often accompanied by barbarous refinements has been trying to hold crime in check yet crime persists why because the instincts that are warring in man are not as the law claims constant forces in a state of equilibrium it is better to risk starving to death then surrender if you give up on your dreams whats left men are convinced of your arguments your sincerity and the seriousness of your efforts only by your death love we say is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death death is not the worst that can happen to men there will one day spring from the brain of science a machine or force so fearful in its potentialities so absolutely terrifying that even man the fighter who will dare torture and death in order to inflict torture and death will be appalled and so abandon war forever it is not the end of the physical body that should worry us rather our concern must be to live while were alive  to release our inner selves from the spiritual death that comes with living behind a facade designed to conform to external definitions of who and what we are we get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking in that race which daily hastens us towards death the body maintains its irreparable lead death is not extinguishing the light it is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come there will be no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in social customs until death is outlawed a belief in hell and the knowledge that every ambition is doomed to frustration at the hands of a skeleton have never prevented the majority of human beings from behaving as though death were no more than an unfounded rumor you hear a lot about god these days god the beneficent god the allgreat god the almighty god the most powerful god the giver of life god the creator of death i mean were hearing about god all the time so we better learn how to deal with it but if we know anything about god god is arbitrary death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome the safest course is to do nothing against ones conscience with this secret we can enjoy life and have no fear from death death solves all problems  no man no problem death to me means nothing as long as i can die fast bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighters honor fear of death increases in exact proportion to increase in wealth we cast away priceless time in dreams born of imagination fed upon illusion and put to death by reality as a wellspent day brings happy sleep so a life well spent brings happy death achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death death is a release from the impressions of the senses and from desires that make us their puppets and from the vagaries of the mind and from the hard service of the flesh madame all stories if continued far enough end in death and he is no truestory teller who would keep that from you know one knows whether death which people fear to be the greatest evil may not be the greatest good personally i would be delighted if there were a life after death especially if it permitted me to continue to learn about this world and others if it gave me a chance to discover how history turns out must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death i simply cant build my hopes on a foundation of confusion misery and death i think peace and tranquillity will return again it is vain for the coward to flee death follows close behind it is only by defying it that the brave escape a useless life is an early death dependency is death to initiative to risktaking and opportunity its time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is despise not death but welcome it for nature wills it like all else give me liberty or give me death death is a commingling of eternity with time in the death of a good man eternity is seen looking through time because i could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me the carriage held but just ourselves and immortality in india we only read about death sickness terrorism crime the death of my father is probably the biggest thing that i ever faced daddy and i were best friends as long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant try to save your soul when death is immanent what can you do we all pay for life with death so everything in between should be free if a man can bridge the gap between life and death if he can live on after hes dead then maybe he was a great man im not afraid of death but im in no hurry to die i have so much i want to do first death like birth is a secret of nature there are worse things in life than death have you ever spent an evening with an insurance salesman an unused life is an early death justifying conscription to promote the cause of liberty is one of the most bizarre notions ever conceived by man forced servitude with the risk of death and serious injury as a price to live free makes no sense death is not an event in life we do not live to experience death if we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present if death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new character would you slow down or speed up when we have lost everything including hope life becomes a disgrace and death a duty whether you like it or not youre forced to come to the realisation that death is out there but i dont fear death im a fatalist i believe when its your time thats it its the hand youre dealt in our brief national history we have shot four of our presidents worried five of them to death impeached one and hounded another out of office and when all else fails we hold an election and assassinate their character theres something about death that is comforting the thought that you could die tomorrow frees you to appreciate your life now ive been looking at some video clips on youtube of president obama  then candidate obama  going through iowa making promises the gap between his promises and his performance is the largest ive seen well since the kardashian wedding and the promise of til death do we part any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee the death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush it will be a slow extinction from apathy indifference and undernourishment absolute silence leads to sadness it is the image of death prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts then until death itself comes no calamity need be feared there is no such thing as inner peace there is only nervousness or death any attempt to prove otherwise constitutes unacceptable behavior after your death you will be what you were before your birth death is the solution to all problems no man  no problem death is a distant rumor to the young foolish men imagine that because judgment for an evil thing is delayed there is no justice but only accident here below judgment for an evil thing is many times delayed some day or two some century or two but it is sure as life it is sure as death he who is the author of a war lets loose the whole contagion of hell and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death drown in a cold vat of whiskey death where is thy sting i know not what others may choose but as for me give me liberty or give me death guilt is perhaps the most painful companion of death i love the name of honor more than i fear death the us couldnt even get rid of saddam hussein and we all know that the eu is just a passing fad theyll be killing each other again in less than a year im sick to death of all these fascist lawsuits tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death if i think more about death than some other people it is probably because i love life more than they do love is anterior to life posterior to death initial of creation and the exponent of breath of all escape mechanisms death is the most efficient i had reasoned this out in my mind there was one of two things i had a right to liberty or death if i could not have one i would have the other no matter how prepared you think you are for the death of a loved one it still comes as a shock and it still hurts very deeply even very young children need to be informed about dying explain the concept of death very carefully to your child this will make threatening him with it much more effective other states are trying to abolish the death penalty mines putting in an express lane the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death death does not concern us because as long as we exist death is not here and when it does come we no longer exist you must not fear death my lads defy him and you drive him into the enemys ranks it is the cause not the death that makes the martyr i was not encouraged to follow the career of a writer because my parents thought that i was going to starve to death they thought nobody can make a living from being a writer in brazil they were not wrong marriage is the death of hope humanity should question itself once more about the absurd and always unfair phenomenon of war on whose stage of death and pain only remain standing the negotiating table that could and should have prevented it our life dreams the utopia our death achieves the ideal live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart the goal of all life is death i look forward to death with great anticipation to meeting god face to face the tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives  the death of genuine feeling the death of inspired response the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself where is the politician who has not promised to fight to the death for lower taxes and who has not proceeded to vote for the very spending projects that make tax cuts impossible death is not the end there remains the litigation over the estate we are not victims of aging sickness and death these are part of scenery not the seer who is immune to any form of change this seer is the spirit the expression of eternal being death is the wish of some the relief of many and the end of all belief is the death of intelligence a complainer is like a death eater because theres a suction of negative energy you can catch a great attitude from great people grumbling is the death of love our life is made by the death of others even in the valley of the shadow of death two and two do not make six the symbolic language of the crucifixion is the death of the old paradigm resurrection is a leap into a whole new way of thinking it is not death or pain that is to be dreaded but the fear of pain or death art is the tree of life science is the tree of death as men are not able to fight against death misery ignorance they have taken it into their heads in order to be happy not to think of them at all nothing can happen more beautiful than death the slave is doomed to worship time and fate and death because they are greater than anything he finds in himself and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour because of its tremendous solemnity death is the light in which great passions both good and bad become transparent no longer limited by outward appearences death and love are the two wings that bear the good man to heaven and i will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death there are as is known insects that die in the moment of fertilization so it is with all joy lifes highest most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death death so called is a thing which makes men weep and yet a third of life is passed in sleep the death of one man is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic our nature consists in motion complete rest is death shrinking away from death is something unhealthy and abnormal which robs the second half of life of its purpose we need men with moral courage to speak and write their real thoughts and to stand by their convictions even to the very death since change is constant you wonder if people crave death because its the only way they can get anything really finished every parting gives a foretaste of death every reunion a hint of the resurrection on neither the sun nor death can a man look fixedly if i die prematurely i shall be saved from being bored to death at my own success if we have been pleased with life we should not be displeased with death since it comes from the hand of the same master sleep is the interest we have to pay on the capital which is called in at death and the higher the rate of interest and the more regularly it is paid the further the date of redemption is postponed even though people may be well known they hold in their hearts the emotions of a simple person for the moments that are the most important of those we know on earth birth marriage and death in every parting there is an image of death it is easy to go down into hell night and day the gates of dark death stand wide but to climb back again to retrace ones steps to the upper air  theres the rub the task death is the king of this world tis his park where he breeds life to feed him cries of pain are music for his banquet when death comes it is never our tenderness that we repent from but our severity the charm of fame is so great that we like every object to which it is attached even death on the plus side death is one of the few things that can be done as easily lying down  it is impossible to experience ones death objectively and still carry a tune when life is victorious there is birth when it is thwarted there is death a warrior is always engaged in a lifeanddeath struggle for peace watching a peaceful death of a human being reminds us of a falling star one of a million lights in a vast sky that flares up for a brief moment only to disappear into the endless night forever to some extent i liken slavery to death death is not natural for a state as it is for a human being for whom death is not only necessary but frequently even desirable it seems to me that if you or i must choose between two courses of thought or action we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world old age is a tyrant who forbids under pain of death the pleasures of youth neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye i have two luxuries to brood over in my walks your loveliness and the hour of my death o that i could have possession of them both in the same minute death is someone you see very clearly with eyes in the center of your heart eyes that see not by reacting to light but by reacting to a kind of a chill from within the marrow of your own life land and sea weakness and decline are great separators but death is the great divorcer for ever for a man who has done his natural duty death is as natural as sleep a revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past death may be the king of terrors but jesus is the king of kings death would not be called bad o people if one knew how to truly die i dont fear death because i dont fear anything i dont understand when i start to think about it i order a massage and it goes away when death the great reconciler has come it is never our tenderness that we repent of but our severity but when i lose my temper i find it difficult to forgive myself i feel ive failed i can be calm in a crisis in the face of death or things that hurt badly i dont get hysterical which may be masochistic of me life is but a moment death also is but another death unites as well as separates it silences all paltry feeling death not merely ends life it also bestows upon it a silent completeness snatched from the hazardous flux to which all things human are subject a new idea is delicate it can be killed by a sneer or a yawn it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right mans brow all violence consists in some people forcing others under threat of suffering or death to do what they do not want to do i balanced all brought all to mind the years to come seemed waste of breath a waste of breath the years behind in balance with this life this death man is born in a day and he dies in a day and the thing is easily over but to have a sick heart for threefourths of ones lifetime is simply to have death renewed every morning and life at that price is not worth living it is difficult to accept death in this society because it is unfamiliar in spite of the fact that it happens all the time we never see it death is just lifes next big adventure i would rather die a meaningful death than to live a meaningless life in the night of death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing generally speaking the way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death i like to behave in an extremely normal wholesome manner for the most part in my daily life even if mentally im consumed with sick visions of violence terror sex and death hearing nuns confessions is like being stoned to death with popcorn life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death if any foreign minister begins to defend to the death a peace conference you can be sure his government has already placed its orders for new battleships and airplanes my father was a man of love he always loved me to death he worked hard in the fields but my father never hit me never i dont ever remember a really cross unkind word from my father i thank my god for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness one is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become one lives ones death one dies ones life if life must not be taken too seriously then so neither must death whether for life or death do your own work well my fear was not of death itself but a death without meaning wild animals never kill for sport man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow creatures is amusing in itself the message that president obama delivered in his speech at notre dame was morality is immoral prolife is the extremist position not a moral position yet we should compromise and work to reduce abortions wheres the compromise between life and death  and why work to reduce the number of them occurring if theres nothing wrong with them true love makes the thought of death frequent easy without terrors it merely becomes the standard of comparison the price one would pay for many things there is nothing which at once affects a man so much and so little as his own death a man must be willing to die for justice death is an inescapable reality and men die daily but good deeds live forever i do not believe that any man fears to be dead but only the stroke of death once you accept your own death all of a sudden youre free to live you no longer care about your reputation you no longer care except so far as your life can be used tactically to promote a cause you believe in it is not death it is dying that alarms me those who have never had a father can at any rate never know the sweets of losing one to most men the death of his father is a new lease of life death is only a larger kind of going abroad the history of the world is the record of the weakness frailty and death of public opinion let us eat and drink neither forgetting death unduly nor remembering it the lord hath mercy on whom he will have mercy etc and the less we think about it the better i am able to follow my own death step by step now i move softly towards the end if you live a life of makebelieve your life isnt worth anything until you do something that does challenge your reality and to me sailing the open ocean is a real challenge because its life or death few cross the river of time and are able to reach nonbeing most of them run up and down only on this side of the river but those who when they know the law follow the path of the law they shall reach the other shore and go beyond the realm of death if i die a violent death as some fear and a few are plotting i know that the violence will be in the thought and the action of the assassins not in my dying disease generally begins that equality which death completes prepare for death if here at night you roam and sign your will before you sup from home if i take death into my life acknowledge it and face it squarely i will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life  and only then will i be free to become myself i would rather live and love where death is king than have eternal life where love is not im one of the slowest drivers on the road i mosey along if youre doing anything too fast including living life too fast that creates sudden death if i have to be somewhere on time i make sure i leave early enough absence from whom we love is worse than death and frustrates hope severer than despair creation destroys as it goes throws down one tree for the rise of another but ideal mankind would abolish death multiply itself million upon million rear up city upon city save every parasite alive until the accumulation of mere existence is swollen to a horror love has no age no limit and no death pale death with impartial step knocks at the hut of the poor and the towers of kings he has not lived badly whose birth and death has been unnoticed by the world bravery is the capacity to perform properly even when scared half to death for those who seek to understand it death is a highly creative force the highest spiritual values of life can originate from the thought and study of death some of us can be examples about going ahead and growing and some of us unfortunately dont make it there and end up being examples because they had to die i hit rock bottom but thank god my bottom wasnt death what i look forward to is continued immaturity followed by death death they say acquits us of all obligations the ceaseless labour of your life is to build the house of death that is the great mistake about the affections it is not the rise and fall of empires the birth and death of kings or the marching of armies that move them most when they answer from their depths it is to the domestic joys and tragedies of life mendacity is a system that we live in liquor is one way out an deaths the other we sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream it may be so the moment after death creativity is not merely the innocent spontaneity of our youth and childhood it must also be married to the passion of the adult human being which is a passion to live beyond ones death if you have only one passion in life  football  and you pursue it to the exclusion of everything else it becomes very dangerous when you stop doing this activity it is as though you are dying the death of that activity is a death in itself when the will defies fear when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate when honor scorns to compromise with death  that is heroism some people think football is a matter of life and death i assure you its much more serious than that in the attempt to defeat death man has been inevitably obliged to defeat life for the two are inextricably related life moves on to death and to deny one is to deny the other death is delightful death is dawn the waking from a weary night of fevers unto truth and light im sick to death of people saying weve made 11 albums that sounds exactly the same infact weve made 12 albums that sound exactly the same hunger revenge to sleep are petty foes but only death the jealous eyes can close people have their own deaths as well as their own lives and even if there is nothing beyond death we shall differ in our nothingness death destroys a man but the idea of death saves him men do not accept their prophets and slay them but they love their martyrs and worship those whom they have tortured to death dont be afraid to feel as angry or as loving as you can because when you feel nothing its just death in order to go on living one must try to escape the death involved in perfectionism we do not celebrate the death of our enemies a country that relies on aid death is better than that it stops you from achieving your potential just as colonialism did death be not proud though some have called thee mighty and dreadful for thou art not so for those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me kurt and i werent the closest of friends but i knew him well enough to be devastated by his death for such a quiet person he was so excited about having a child the teutons have been singing the swan song ever since they entered the ranks of history they have always confounded truth with death divorce is probably as painful as death death has a tendency to encourage a depressing view of war i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it im irish i think about death all the time what you possess in the world will be found at the day of your death to belong to someone else but what you are will be yours forever the very essence of literature is the war between emotion and intellect between life and death when literature becomes too intellectual  when it begins to ignore the passions the emotions  it becomes sterile silly and actually without substance which death is preferably to every other the unexpected i mean whatever kills you kills you and your death is authentic no matter how you die not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia there may be legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not with regard to abortion and euthanasia the darkness of death is like the evening twilight it makes all objects appear more lovely to the dying ive looked that old scoundrel death in the eye many times but this time i think he has me on the ropes death is the only pure beautiful conclusion of a great passion death doesnt affect the living because it has not happened yet death doesnt concern the dead because they have ceased to exist a tragedy need not have blood and death its enough that it all be filled with that majestic sadness that is the pleasure of tragedy there is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval the fear of death often proves mortal and sets people on methods to save their lives which infallibly destroy them theres nothing wrong in suffering if you suffer for a purpose our revolution didnt abolish danger or death it simply made danger and death worthwhile as long as you have capital punishment there is no guarantee that innocent people wont be put to death in every death a busy world comes to an end defoe says that there were a hundred thousand country fellows in his time ready to fight to the death against popery without knowing whether popery was a man or a horse it is old age rather than death that is to be contrasted with life old age is lifes parody whereas death transforms life into a destiny in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension death does away with time here i am trying to live or rather i am trying to teach the death within me how to live for death is not the worst but when one wants to die and is not able even to have that if forgers and malefactors are put to death by the secular power there is much more reason for excommunicating and even putting to death one convicted of heresy if what you do is being threatened as a profession that could be scary but thats the same reason why i walked out on stage many times after receiving death threats i couldnt live without doing what i wanted to do so at the same time i have to be willing to die for it and as long as youre subject to birth and death youll never attain enlightenment good music comes out of people playing together knowing what they want to do and going for it you have to sweat over it and bug it to death you cant do it by pushing buttons and watching a tv screen a real hangover is nothing to try out family remedies on the only cure for a real hangover is death the human consciousness is really homogeneous there is no complete forgetting even in death death never takes the wise man by surprise he is always ready to go as a well spent day brings happy sleep so life well used brings happy death death is frightening and so is eternal life to have the truth in your possession you can be found guilty sentenced to death communism is the death of the soul it is the organization of total conformity  in short of tyranny  and it is committed to making tyranny universal for the wretched one night is like a thousand for someone faring well death is just one more night not even old age knows how to love death i look at death proof and realize i had too much time death comes at you no matter what you do in this life and to equate drugs with death is a facile comparison a man who cannot be enticed by money or intimidated by the threat of jail or death has two of the strongest weapons that anyone has to offer the government is tottering we must deal it the death blow an any cost to delay action is the same as death i was courtmartialled in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence so i said they could shoot me in my absence the leading cause of death among fashion models is falling through street grates the true face of smoking is disease death and horror  not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray my fathers death my move and my frightening and difficult delivery created a tremendous amount of stress pain and sadness for me i was practically devastated beyond recovery death is really a great blessing for humanity without it there could be no real progress people who lived for ever would not only hamper and discourage the young but they would themselves lack sufficient stimulus to be creative to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure sleep is good death is better but of course the best thing would to have never been born at all all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues freedom well to the people who pray for me to not only have an agonising death but then be reborn to have an agonising and horrible eternal life of torture i say well good on you see you there i have more than once in my time woken up feeling like death no true believer could be intolerant or a persecutor if i were a magistrate and the law carried the death penalty against atheists i would begin by sending to the stake whoever denounced another the fear of death comes from limited awareness i went to medical school because i wanted to ask the big questions do we have a soul does god exist what happens after death every spiritual tradition has this idea of death and resurrection its not unique to christianity all i want is a gentleman im sick to bloody death of bastards crucial to understanding federalism in modern day america is the concept of mobility or the ability to vote with your feet if you dont support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol  dont come to texas if you dont like medicinal marijuana and gay marriage dont move to california it is impossible that anything so natural so necessary and so universal as death should ever have been designed by providence as an evil to mankind communism possesses a language which every people can understand  its elements are hunger envy and death death is the liberator of him whom freedom cannot release the physician of him whom medicine cannot cure and the comforter of him whom time cannot console death is one moment and life is so many of them a pun does not commonly justify a blow in return but if a blow were given for such cause and death ensued the jury would be judges both of the facts and of the pun and might if the latter were of an aggravated character return a verdict of justifiable homicide man as long as he lives is immortal one minute before his death he shall be immortal but one minute later god wins death obsesses me yes it does i cant really understand why it doesnt obsess everyone  i think it does really im just a little more out about it prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide the nearer people approach old age the closer they return to a semblance of childhood until the time comes for them to depart this life again like children neither tired of living nor aware of death like all of us in this storm between birth and death i can wreak no great changes on the world only small changes for the better i hope in the lives of those i love it is a sign of creeping inner death when we can no longer praise the living football soccer is a matter of life and death except more important death is not the biggest fear we have our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive  the risk to be alive and express what we really are i never really got on that well with yoko anyway strangely enough i only started to get to know her after johns death the rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated take care of your life and the lord will take care of your death those who welcome death have only tried it from the ears up i mean in the south african case many of those who were part of death squads would have been respectable members of their white community people who went to church on sunday every sunday an evil life is a kind of death death is less bitter punishment than deaths delay my life comes down to three moments the death of my father meeting my husband and the birth of my daughter everything i did previous to that just doesnt seem to add up to very much how strange this fear of death is we are never frightened at a sunset i feel monotony and death to be almost the same whether or not we believe in survival of consciousness after death reincarnation and karma it has very serious implications for our behavior a man may devote himself to death and destruction to save a nation but no nation will devote itself to death and destruction to save mankind we want our idols to be dead because it makes death a much less scary place not the torturer will scare me nor the bodys final fall nor the barrels of deaths rifles nor the shadows on the wall nor the night when to the ground the last dim star of pain is hurled but the blind indifference of a merciless unfeeling world only a humanity to whom death has become as indifferent as its members that has itself died can inflict it administratively on innumerable people normality is death birth was the death of him death is the sound of distant thunder at a picnic death is easier than a wretched life and better never to have born than to live and fare badly when i came back to dublin i was courtmartialed in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence so i said they could shoot me in my absence generosity during life is a very different thing from generosity in the hour of death one proceeds from genuine liberality and benevolence the other from pride or fear an unemployed existence is a worse negation of life than death itself faithfulness to the past can be a kind of death above ground writing of the past is a resurrection the past then lives in your words and you are free as far as thinking about death and murder and various ways of killing people and how people die i probably have the most twisted mind in slayer it has ever been since time began and ever will be till time lose breath that love is a mood  no more  to man and love to a woman is life or death poor georgia okeeffe death didnt soften the opinions of the art world toward her paintings and yet i suppose you mourn the loss or the death of what you thought your life was even if you find your life is better after you mourn the future that you thought youd planned death is the veil which those who live call life they sleep and it is lifted death is an absolute marvel we live in grief for having left the womb for having left the teat then school then home in my case it was leaving marriages and the death of my wife madness need not be all breakdown it may also be breakthrough it is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death success is like death the more successful you become the higher the houses in the hills get and the higer the fences get once you start doing only what youve already proven you can do youre on the road to death death gives us sleep eternal youth and immortality all societies on the verge of death are masculine a society can survive with only one man no society will survive a shortage of women death is softer by far than tyranny for children preserve the fame of a man after his death smiles tears of all my life  and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death being an old maid is like death by drowning a really delightful sensation after you cease to struggle pain and death are part of life to reject them is to reject life itself mcveighs lawyer got him the death penalty which quite frankly i could have done i dont want to get into the whos a hostagetaker discussion here but what is the estate tax its a double tax on death economists will tell you that its really not a tax that soaks the rich but its a tax on capital that deprives business investment and therefore job creation do not seek death death will find you but seek the road which makes death a fulfillment life is a great sunrise i do not see why death should not be an even greater one every parting is a form of death as every reunion is a type of heaven an important consequence of freeing oneself from the fear of death is a radical opening to spirituality of a universal and nondenominational type man has but three events in his life to be born to live and to die he is not conscious of his birth he suffers at his death and he forgets to live rock and menopause do not mix it is not good it sucks and every day i fight it to the death or at the very least not let it take me over in the first book of my discworld series published more than 26 years ago i introduced death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this  death has featured in art and literature since medieval times and for centuries we have had a fascination with the grim reaper death was like love a romantic escape we have abolished the death penalty for humans so why should it continue for animals i dont believe in life after death but i do believe in some grinding destiny that watches over us on earth if i didnt the safety valve would give and the boiler would explode no society has been able to abolish human sadness no political system can deliver us from the pain of living from our fear of death our thirst for the absolute it is the human condition that directs the social condition not vice versa a text of tibetan buddhism describes the time of death as a unique opportunity for spiritual liberation from the cycles of death and rebirth and a period that determines our next incarnation life and death are important dont suffer them in vain the acceptance of death gives you more of a stake in life in living life happily as it should be lived living for the moment that which is so universal as death must be a benefit the call of death is a call of love death can be sweet if we answer it in the affirmative if we accept it as one of the great eternal forms of life and transformation what is the value of sticking a microphone in a mans face right after he has learned of his wifes death i offer neither pay nor quarters nor food i offer only hunger thirst forced marches battles and death let him who loves his country with his heart and not merely with his lips follow me i think about death a lot like i think we all do i dont think of suicide as an option but as fun its an interesting idea that you can control how you go its this thing thats looming and you can control it til the infallibility of human judgements shall have been proved to me i shall demand the abolition of the penalty of death an insatiable appetite for glory leads to sacrifice and death but innate instinct leads to selfpreservation and life nothing in life is promised except death salman rushdie indeed any writer who abuses the prophet or indeed any prophet under islamic law the sentence for that is actually death dont be afraid of death so much as an inadequate life of emotions of love of breakup of love and hate and death and dying mama apple pie and the whole thing it covers a lot of territory country music does the ideal death i think is what was the ideal victorian death you know with your grandchildren around you a bit of sobbing and you say goodbye to your loved ones making certain that one of them has been left behind to look after the shop ill keep peace at all cost even if i choke to death on my tongue it is natural to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes to that siren until she allures us to our death just as i shall select my ship when i am about to go on a voyage or my house when i propose to take a residence so i shall choose my death when i am about to depart from life days will prove that the assassination policy will not finish the hamas hamas leaders wish to be martyrs and are not scared of death jihad will continue and the resistance will continue until we have victory or we will be martyrs death is the great hope of all life the desire to expend itself to be used and consumed by its own longing for itself our criminal justice system is fallible we know it even though we dont like to admit it it is fallible despite the best efforts of most within it to do justice and this fallibility is at the end of the day the most compelling persuasive and winning argument against a death penalty death is the golden key that opens the palace of eternity long hair is an unpardonable offense which should be punishable by death the kids out there want something they can relate to something thats real most of that whiny stuff isnt real the cheesy pop songs just bore me to death i was brought up by very witty people who were dealing with quite difficult things disease and death i was brought up by people who tended to giggle at funerals life without idealism is empty indeed we just hope or starve to death everything tends to make us believe that there exists a certain point of the mind at which life and death the real and the imagined past and future the communicable and the incommunicable high and low cease to be perceived as contradictions i have no fear of death more important i dont fear life o death rock me asleep bring me to quiet rest let pass my weary guiltless ghost out of my careful breast death comes in a flash and thats the truth of it the persons gone in less than 24 frames of film at the moment of death i hope to be surprised i was courtmartial in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence so i said they could shoot me in my absence inactivity is death youve never seen death look in the mirror every day and you will see it like bees working in a glass hive after the writers death reading his journal is like receiving a long letter the day of my birth my death began its walk it is walking toward me without hurrying everybody is entertained to death talk to people in their own language if you do it well theyll say god he said exactly what i was thinking and when they begin to respect you theyll follow you to the death i was very sad to hear of the death of ronnie barker who was such a warm friendly and encouraging presence to have when i started in television he was also a great comic actor to learn from the world is put back by the death of every one who has to sacrifice the development of his or her peculiar gifts to conventionality i am not the born how can there be either birth or death for me the desire to die was my one and only concern to it i have sacrificed everything even death life inspires more dread than death  it is life which is the great unknown buddhas move freely through birth and death appearing and disappearing at will we were aware of the fact that death walks hand in hand with struggle it is not tolerable it is not possible that from so much death so much sacrifice and ruin so much heroism a greater and better humanity shall not emerge if your best friend has stolen your girlfriend it does become life and death im possibly a very morbid person but i think about death a lot quarreling over food and drink having neither scruples nor shame not knowing right from wrong not trying to avoid death or injury not fearful of greater strength or of greater numbers greedily aware only of food and drink  such is the bravery of the dog and boar i grew up in the suburbs and basically associate the suburbs with cultural death you know americans are obsessed with life and death and rebirth thats the american cycle you know awakening tragic horrible death and then phoenix rising from the ashes thats the american story again and again i was fantasising about my own death i started thinking what my funeral would be like and what music would be played i was at that level of insanity andrew woods death changed things for a few weeks i probably got even heavier into drugs after that only in death will i relinquish my belts benjamin franklin said there were only two things certain in life death and taxes but id like to add a third certainty trash and while some in this room might want to discuss reducing taxes i want to talk about reducing trash when you break up your whole identity is shattered its like death deep down no one really believes they have a right to live but this death sentence generally stays tucked away hidden beneath the difficulty of living if that difficulty is removed from time to time death is suddenly there unintelligibly nothing endears so much a friend as sorrow for his death the pleasure of his company has not so powerful an influence i saw also that there was an ocean of darkness and death but an infinite ocean of light and love which flowed over the ocean of darkness there is something about poverty that smells like death as long as you dont make waves ripples life seems easy but thats condemning yourself to impotence and death before you are dead if shaw and einstein couldnt beat death what chance have i got practically none if some persons died and others did not die death would be a terrible affliction the passion of hatred is so long lived and so obstinate a malady that the surest sign of death in a sick person is their desire for reconciliation there are only three events in a mans life birth life and death he is not conscious of being born he dies in pain and he forgets to live old age calm expanded broad with the haughty breadth of the universe old age flowing free with the delicious nearby freedom of death everything one does in life even love occurs in an express train racing toward death to smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving it is to concern oneself with something other than life or death people praise virtue but they hate it they run away from it it freezes you to death and in this world youve got to keep your feet warm families survive one way or another you have a tie a connection that exists long after death through many lifetimes see i have set before you this day life and good death and evil i have set before you life and death blessing and curse therefore choose life death in itself is nothing but we fear to be we know not what we know not where for those who live neither with religious consolations about death nor with a sense of death or of anything else as natural death is the obscene mystery the ultimate affront the thing that cannot be controlled it can only be denied death is with you all the time you get deeper in it as you move towards it but its not unfamiliar to you its always been there so what becomes unfamiliar to you when you pass away from the moment is really life people think celebrities dont have to worry about human things like sickness and death and rent its like youve traveled to this land of celebrity this other country they want you to tell about what you saw the essence of the hebrew bible transmitted by christianity is separation between life and death nature and god good and evil man and woman and the holy and the profane when i listen to music i dont want to hear about flowers i like death and destruction in the last analysis it is our conception of death which decides our answers to all the questions that life puts to us the compact which exists between the north and the south is a covenant with death and an agreement with hell his death was the first time that ed wynn ever made anyone sad but i was very very lucky and it was a wake up call as far as motorbikes are concerned i never flirted with death on the bike but now im totally convinced theyre death machines to be honest im scared to death of rollercoaster rides there is no fundamental difference between the preparation for death and the practice of dying and spiritual practice leading to enlightenment i was blessed with a birth and a death and i guess i just want some say in between all those vitamins arent to keep death at bay theyre to keep deterioration at bay no one else can take risks for us or face our losses on our behalf or give us selfesteem no one can spare us from lifes slings and arrows and when death comes we meet it alone my mortal foe can no ways wish me a greater harm than englands hate neither should death be less welcome unto me than such a mishap betide me the meaning of life is not to be discovered only after death in some hidden mysterious realm on the contrary it can be found by eating the succulent fruit of the tree of life and by living in the here and now as fully and creatively as we can death is not more certainly a separation of our souls from our bodies than the christian life is a separation of our souls from worldly tempers vain indulgences and unnecessary cares i dont think kids have a problem with death its us older ones who are nearer to it that start being frightened the great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation and the great goal of the conservative movement as it rose to triumph in the 1980s was to remove that threat  to keep osha the epa and the ftc from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace life is doubt and faith without doubt is nothing but death the death of pope john paul ii led many of different faiths and of no faith to acknowledge their debt to the roman catholic church for holding on to absolutes that the rest of us can measure ourselves against you dont have people chanting death to america in israel the earth is rocky and full of roots its clay and it seems doomed and polluted but you dig little holes for the ugly shriveled bulbs throw in a handful of poppy seeds and cover it all over and you know youll never see it again  its death and clay and shrivel and your hands are nicked from the rocks your nails black with soil the death of any man aged 56 is very sad for his widow and family and no one would deny that steve jobs was a brilliant and highly innovative technician with great business flair and marketing ability im scared to death of being poor its like a fat girl who loses 500 pounds but is always fat inside i grew up poor and will always feel poor inside its my pet paranoia your body must become familiar with its death  in all its possible forms and degrees  as a selfevident imminent and emotionally neutral step on the way towards the goal you have found worthy of your life death is a billiondollar business they cant even pass a law where it takes seven days to get a gun why dont you have to go through the same kind of screening you do to get a drivers license its totally insane as a kid all i thought about was death but you cant tell your parents that the death penalty is becoming a way of life in this country i mean im 48 years old and ive been through a lot in my life  you know loss whether it be death illness separation i mean the failed expectations we all have dreams death comes not to the living soul nor age to the loving heart im working myself to death at the new york athletic club they serve amazing food people go there get healthy and then eat themselves to death  which is i suppose the right way to do it property is unstable and youth perishes in a moment life itself is held in the grinning fangs of death yet men delay to obtain release from the world alas the conduct of mankind is surprising well theres a remedy for all things but death which will be sure to lay us flat one time or other old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death life and death they are somehow sweetly and beautifully mixed but i dont know how doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded uzi im sick to death of famous people standing up and using their celebrity to promote a cause if i see a particular need i do try to help but theres a lot that can be achieved by putting a check in the right place and shutting up about it life is a predicament which precedes death death is the easiest of all things after it and the hardest of all things before it death is inevitable but life  thats the tricky bit where things happen she looks like a warrior i mean bellatrix does mean warrior and shes also a bit of a fatale shes the right hand of voldemort and the only woman death eater people think celebrities dont have to worry about human things like sickness and death and rent its like youve traveled to this land of celebrity this other country for the sake of goodness and love man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts i cant turn on the television without seeing me or open the newspaper without seeing me and honestly im sick to death of me he who does not fear death cares naught for threats to die for ones country is such a worthy fate that all compete for so beautiful a death each instant of life is a step toward death you always think that 70 is the end of the road somebody died when they were 73 good life youre closer to death and you better make sure you dont waste too much of your time doing things you dont want to do no point in saying things you dont believe in when im lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me science without conscience is the death of the soul had it not been for slavery the death penalty would have likely been abolished in america slavery became a haven for the death penalty so much of motion is so much of life and so much of joy and to stand still or get on but slowly is death and the devil death is the mother of beauty hence from her alone shall come fulfillment to our dreams and our desires in sleep we lie all naked and alone in sleep we are united at the heart of night and darkness and we are strange and beautiful asleep for we are dying the darkness and we know no death if efforts to do social work are couched in selfish motives then they will die a premature death why would my efforts get politicised i have values i inherited from my father he helped many anyone even a postman knocking on our door would get a glass of water and some sweets but i have been in some very beautiful churches then ive looked outside and seen people starving to death for tis not in mere death that men die most the greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase let no one be called happy till his death to which i would add let no one till his death be called unhappy the wages of sin are death but by the time taxes are taken out its just sort of a tired feeling not ignorance but ignorance of ignorance is the death of knowledge i believe that his death and resurrection transformed humanitys relationship with god islam is a religion of success unlike christianity which has as its main image in the west at least a man dying in a devastating disgraceful helpless death become an internationalist and learn to respect all life make war on machines and in particular the sterile machines of corporate death and the robots that guard them does not the very word creative mean to build to initiate to give out to act  rather than to be acted upon to be subjective living photography is positive in its approach it sings a song of life  not death death is an absolute mystery we are all vulnerable to it its what makes life interesting and suspenseful its just as idiotic to say there is no life after death as it is to say there is one knowing how to die is knowing how to live what is death anyway its the outcome of life when i did bumbleardy i was so intensely aware of death eugene my friend and partner was dying here in the house when i did bumbleardy i did bumbleardy to save myself i did not want to die with him i wanted to live as any human being does im not afraid of death the distinctions of fine art bore me to death as a kid all i thought about was death when theater becomes a soothing middleclass thing when its packaged as the night out then thats the death of it living is a sickness to which sleep provides relief every sixteen hours its a palliative the remedy is death monarchs ought to put to death the authors and instigators of war as their sworn enemies and as dangers to their states death is a delightful hiding place for weary men the enemy fought with savage fury and met death with all its horrors without shrinking or complaining not one asked to be spared but fought as long as they could stand or sit i know im drinking myself to a slow death but then im in no hurry for days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow but phone calls taper off it is a horrible fact that we can read in the daily paper without interrupting our breakfast numerical reckonings of death and destruction that ought to break our hearts or scare us out of our wits ive always been scared to death of pain  afraid even to think of it policemen so cherish their status as keepers of the peace and protectors of the public that they have occasionally been known to beat to death those citizens or groups who question that status at a certain age death becomes familiar to youor a loss becomes familiarthe tragedies that are more commonplace in life loved you cant use it in the past tense death does not stop that love at all have an earnestness for death and you will have life there is no harm in patience and no profit in lamentation death is easier to bear than that which precedes it and more severe than that which comes after it remember the death of the apostle of god and your sorrow will be lessened you can cry about death and very properly so your own as well as anybody elses but its inevitable so youd better grapple with it and cope and be aware that not only is it inevitable but it has always been inevitable if you see what i mean sinful and forbidden pleasures are like poisoned bread they may satisfy appetite for the moment but there is death in them at the end im very comfortable with the nature of life and death and that we come to an end whats most difficult to imagine is that those dreams and early yearnings and desires of childhood and adolescence will also disappear but who knows maybe you become part of the eternal whatever if you make every game a life and death proposition youre going to have problems for one thing youll be dead a lot its an incredible con job when you think about it to believe something now in exchange for something after death even corporations with their reward systems dont try to make it posthumous yes people pull the trigger  but guns are the instrument of death gun control is necessary and delay means more death and horror disease insanity and death were the angels that attended my cradle and since then have followed me throughout my life people always say that pregnant women have a glow and i say its because youre sweating to death the end of the animal trade would leave more time to trap or beat to death pop star wannabes we are weak writing is difficult but for my own sake i do not regret this journey which has shown that englishmen can endure hardships help one another and meet death with as great a fortitude as ever in the past the sole equality on earth is death i put for the general inclination of all mankind a perpetual and restless desire of power after power that ceaseth only in death without fullness of experience length of days is nothing when fullness of life has been achieved shortness of days is nothing that is perhaps why the young have usually so little fear of death they live by intensities that the elderly have forgotten i intend to leave after my death a large fund for the promotion of the peace idea but i am skeptical as to its results sleep is lovely death is better still not to have been born is of course the miracle life isnt fair its just fairer than death thats all i feel like i dont watch that many shows with death consciousness after death demonstrates the possibility of consciousness operating independently of the body whenever i watch tv and see those poor starving kids all over the world i cant help but cry i mean id love to be skinny like that but not with all those flies and death and stuff when applied to politics and taken to its extreme kitsch is the mask of death fascism was all aesthetics there was no core principle to it there was no truth to it all interest in disease and death is only another expression of interest in life i love this pedal to death the only way you could keep me from playing one is by chopping off my legs even when youre making a movie about life death is a presence and i guess its part of my dramatic viewpoint im not sure why exactly maybe im drawn to it as a story element once a disease has entered the body all parts which are healthy must fight it not one alone but all because a disease might mean their common death nature knows this and nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster people can undergo a sudden change of thinking and loyalties under threat of death or intense social pressure and isolation from friends and family its not the normal way to look at things but i experienced death at a really young age and because of that its been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible i made a supreme effort not to do that thing that parents do which is to bore people without children to death by going on and on about how funny their children are so theres none of that hopefully courage is the art of being the only one who knows youre scared to death death the final triumphant lover i believe that people would be alive today if there were a death penalty for three days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow but phone calls taper off my brother was a great favorite with everybody and his death cast a gloom upon the whole neighborhood so for twelve miles i rode with sherman and we became fast friends he asked me all manner of questions on the way and i found that he knew my father well and remembered his tragic death in salt creek valley tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death when a life has been lived completely honestly completely successfully or just completely the correct response to deaths perfect punctuation mark is a smile life cant defeat a writer who is in love with writing for life itself is a writers lover until death when sudden death takes a president opportunities for new beginnings flourish among the ambitious and the tensions among such people can be dramatic as they were when president kennedy was killed death is the final wakeup call as the fly bangs against the window attempting freedom while the door stands open so we bang against death ignoring heaven i am bound to add that the excess in too little has ever proved in me more dangerous than the excess in too much the last may cause indigestion but the first causes death to appear on the stage drunk to have them leave there and remember me making drunken mistakes that was death we have a limit a very discouraging humiliating limit death a face to lose youth for to occupy age with the dream of meet death with i think the amazing thing about gospel music is that not only does it lift up the death and resurrection of our lord which is consistent with the gospel but it is uniquely communicated depending upon the generation there are certain people that are marked for death i have my little list of those that treated me unfairly judged by the law of england i know this crime entails upon me the penalty of death but the history of ireland explains that crime and justifies it we do not choose the day of our birth nor may we choose the day of our death yet choice is the sovereign faculty of the mind but there is a difference here when jewish children are murdered arabs celebrate the deed the death of an arab child is no cause for celebration in israel im in awe of people out there who deal with alzheimers because they have to deal with death 10 times over year after year failure too is a form of death we know the road to freedom has always been stalked by death the thing about death is that its honest i think the way we talk about cancer has really evolved i remember the way my grandmother used to talk about it like a death sentence noone would even mention the word i really enjoy theater i just went to see death of a salesman and it knocked me on my ass i was extended secret service protection during my presidential run in 1984 when i received the most death threats ever made toward a candidate my mother was the sweetest lady who ever lived on this planet but if you tried to tell her that jesus wasnt a christian she would stomp you to death the disembodied spirit is immortal there is nothing of it that can grow old or die but the embodied spirit sees death on the horizon as soon as its day dawns constantly risking absurdity and death whenever he performs above the heads of his audience the poet like an acrobat climbs on rhyme to a high wire of his own making im more afraid of marriage than death pay mind to your own life your own health and wholeness a bleeding heart is of no help to anyone if it bleeds to death i get scared to death when i see people who say theyve found jesus christ and theyre out there and i wonder whos teaching them whos mentoring them to say yes you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and plunge both hands into life up to the elbows it is easy to say no even if saying no means death giving is good but taking is bad and brings death death is the sanction of everything the storyteller can tell he has borrowed his authority from death im not afraid of death its the stake one puts up in order to play the game of life to eat bread without hope is still slowly to starve to death art has two constant two unending concerns it always meditates on death and thus always creates life all great genuine art resembles and continues the revelation of st john i mean death is a serious thing certainly not to be sneezed at long hair is an unpardonable offence which should be punishable by death men should be bewailed at their birth and not at their death we are now operating a school system in america thats more segregated than at any time since the death of martin luther king in my solitude i have pondered much on the incomprehensible subjects of space eternity life and death it is love not reason that is stronger than death the only religious way to think of death is as part and parcel of life death valley is really wideopen  its bigger than rhode island  and its less a part of california than an ungoverned territory so theres lots of weird copsandrobbers stuff going on even when youre making a movie about life death is a presence and i guess its part of my dramatic viewpoint im not sure why exactly lidia bastianich sorry but kind of boring i mean i love lidia but you can fall asleep watching her and mario batali i love mario to death but hes not romantic or sensual those are the things i bring to the table to a billion people around the world surviving on just a dollar a day the question of what to eat tonight is more about life and death than about recipes the struggle of poor people around the globe weighs heavily on me especially now that i am a mother which is why i work with oxfam i just finished my homework fast i was bored to death there wasnt 500 channels so there was a thing for a librarian to teach a kid like me about reading i started reading early and i read all the time because i love it i think prince should open up a little more to other artists just because we love prince especially the old stuff  we love him to death but if he opened up he would be something to deal with imagine kanye west producing a prince track it would be banoodles death ends a life not a relationship we march and fight to death or on to victory our might is right no traitors shall prevail our hearts are steeled against the fiery gates of hell no shot or shell can still our mighty song fear was absolutely necessary without it i would have been scared to death everybody thinks im at deaths door but im not theres nothing seriously wrong with me and my heart is in 100 percent working order anything else you may hear is a damn lie death is an endless night so awful to contemplate that it can make us love life and value it with such passion that it may be the ultimate cause of all joy and all art i mean sting is one of my great buddies and i love him to death but the issue is not only life and death but our existence before god and our being judged by him all of us were sinners before him and worthy of condemnation theres really no such thing as the agony of dying im quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death you see something happens when the body knows its about to go peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland endorphins they attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain a lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful but ive seen quite a few deaths and with one exception ive never known anyone to undergo anything like agony thats amazing when you think about it i mean how complicated the mechanism is thats being taken apart so we mustnt lower our guard in any sense because of what has happened in terms of the death of osama bin laden and we are certainly not doing that the terror threat level here in the uk remains at severe and were very conscious of the need to continue that death gives meaning to our lives it gives importance and value to time time would become meaningless if there were too much of it if we cant face death well never overcome it you have to look it straight in the eye then you can turn around and walk back out into the light marriage can be viewed as the waiting room for death i can choose to accelerate my disease to an alcoholic death or incurable insanity or i can choose to live within my thoroughly human condition ive always had bronchitis ive been administered the sacrament of death three times for it it is education that will arm us with the tools that will enable us to succeed and put a stop to the rising rates of preventable death most of us harbour a significant amount of subconscious fear about death and act out of this fear in our daily lives war is not the only arena where peace is done to death i am against the death penalty my father was against the death penalty and that was hard in the son of sam summer when fear was driving the desire for the death penalty the need to understand prescription information can literally be a matter of life and death movies like that arent about the visual effects and explosions theyre human stories about family about life about death to awake from death is to die in peace death is feared as birth is forgotten when death has you by the throat you dont mince words should i perchance still feel after my death i would no longer have any doubt but i would most certainly give the lie to anyone asserting before me that i was dead if death is in the room its pretty interesting but i would also say that im interested in getting myself to believe that its going to happen to me im interested in it because if youre not youre nuts its really de facto what were here to find out about a man whose life has been dishonourable is not entitled to escape disgrace in death my father i liked but it was only after his death that i got to know him by writing the play before i pitch any game from spring training to game 7 of the world series im scared to death in seattle i soon found that my radical ideas and aesthetic explorations  ideas and explorations that in richmond virginia might have gotten me stoned to death with hush puppies  were not only accepted but occasionally applauded coming to terms with the fear of death is conducive to healing positive personality transformation and consciousness evolution liberty for wolves is death to the lambs i think one thing that kids who grow up on farms really have going for them is they have exposure to death and birth in a totally different way i think it takes away a little bit of the mystery and a little bit of the fear and i do wish i had that and i wish i was able to grow my own food i now bid farewell to the country of my birth  of my passions  of my death a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies  whose factions i sought to quell  whose intelligence i prompted to a lofty aim  whose freedom has been my fatal dream the death of antigay hate speech is no doubt being hastened by the headspinning speed with which gays as a group  to say nothing of gay marriage  are becoming an unremarkable and even quite traditional parts of american life our birth is nothing but our death begun as tapers waste the moment they take fire virtue alone has majesty in death less base the fear of death than fear of life life is the desert life the solitude death joins us to the great majority i am one who believes that one of the greatest dangers of advertising is not that of misleading people but that of boring them to death people are scared to death of dying i am the opposite people on death row the treatment of animals womens right to choose so much in america is based on religious fundamentalist christianity grow up this is the modern world it is long since i could have adventured on eternity through gods mercy and christs merits but death remained somewhat terrible and that now is taken away and now death is no more to me but to cast myself into my husbands arms and to lie down with him fear not and the god of mercies grant a full gale and a fair entry into his kingdom which may carry sweetly and swiftly over the bar that you find not the rub of death i wish to be a martyr and i dont fear death death has always had a prominent place in my mind there are times when i think somebody might kill me i looked death right in the face we are all of us resigned to death its life we arent resigned to the approach of death certainly concentrates the mind fear of death has never played a large part in my consciousness  perhaps unimaginative of me i might be deceiving myself but i do not think that i do have an inordinate fear of death we see death constantly on film for a culture that has such a problem with death we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way we see people shot killed and blown up and we find it funny and sexy and all those things but the reality of it is that every day people die and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it hamlet is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper all the big unknowable questions like what it is to be a human being the difference between sanity and insanity the meaning of life and death whats real and not real all these subjects can literally drive you mad if we openly declare what is wrong with us what is our deepest need then perhaps the death and despair will by degrees disappear the most dire disaster in love is the death of imagination to be immortal is commonplace except for man all creatures are immortal for they are ignorant of death what is divine terrible incomprehensible is to know that one is immortal life and death have been lacking in my life ultimately life is disease death and oblivion its still better than high school my children are magical creatures and i love them to death but then im one of those guys that is still a bit afraid of the telephone its implications for conversation i still wonder if the jukebox might be the death of live music perhaps we dont need these religious concoctions to pillow the fear of death just the fact that there is an unknown and something greater can bring a feeling of peace thats enough for me if a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club theyd starve to death in almost every interview someone asks what does him stand for i cant even remember our latest lie about that when hanson was hot we said it means hanson is murder the name doesnt have a particular history his infernal majesty was a totally different band i think him derives from some death metal joke early this morning i signed my death warrant i dont think i would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties theres always the inevitable question of whether someone you gave the order to execute might truly have been innocent i hit rock bottom but thank god my bottom wasnt death in an artwork youre always looking for artistic decisions so an ashtray is perfect an ashtray has got life and death since i was a child death is definitely something that i think about every day but i think that everybody does you try and avoid it but its such a big thing that you cant the difference between art about death and actual death is that ones a celebration and the others a dull fact i was taught to confront things you cant avoid death is one of those things to live in a society where youre trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy the fact that flowers dont last for ever makes them beautiful i wouldnt feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy  id be bored to death its not life or death its a game and at the end of the game there is going to be a winner and a loser miller didnt write death of a salesman he released it it was there inside him waiting to be turned loose thats the measure of its merit death is like an arrow that is already in flight and your life lasts only until it reaches you i was never afraid of failure after that because i think coming that close to death you get kissed with the years the actual experience of course fades but the flavor of it doesnt i just had a real sense of what choice do i have but to live fully i think that obviously there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world there is a death wish a perverse death wish not just for ourselves not just for the movie death wish but for the end of all human life when you think about it the end of the world is a little bit like death we all know its going to come eventually and as we get older we feel we see the signs more and more distinctly i try to write lyrics so that they wont age which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence a friend said to me be glad for your troubles  they strengthen you well if thats the truth im going to be so strong theyll have to beat me to death she goes through the vale of death alone each time a babe is born as it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this ordeal so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it emigration is no longer a solution its a defeat people are risking death drowning every day but theyre knocking on doors that are not open in goddess religion death is not feared but is understood to be a part of life followed by birth and renewal deaths an old joke but each individual encounters it anew feminists bore me to death i follow my instinct and if that supports young girls in any way great but id rather they saw it more as a lesson about following their own instincts rather than imitating somebody no real english gentleman in his secret soul was ever sorry for the death of a political economist there are hundreds of frank lloyd wright buildings around the united states and in other countries too wright lived into his 90s and one of his most famous buildings the guggenheim museum in new york was completed just before his death wright buildings look like wright buildings  that is their paradox vets do what doctors used to  diagnose the injury or the condition patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death somehow knowing that alzheimers is coming mocks all ones aspirations  to tell stories to think through certain issues as only a novel can do to be recognised for ones accomplishments and hard work  in a way that old familiar death does not we should weep for men at their birth not at their death you only live twice once when you are born and once when you look death in the face i think when youre 10 years old its too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode kids are better left naive about certain things i love myself anything that has my name im tickled to death sin brought death and death will disappear with the disappearance of sin there is nothing glamorous about death my book trust your heart which is the story of my life will be followed by singing lessons a memoir of love loss hope and healing which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy defeat the fear of death and welcome the death of fear the coward sneaks to death the brave live on only those who spread treachery fire and death out of hatred for the prosperity of others are undeserving of pity if the heart stops for more than two minutes you have massive brain death there are only two minutes between our conscious world and zero thats how fragile our consciousness is the police came to me to say i had death threats and that i had to be careful i believe in the institution of marriage of course being a mormon we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part if you really try hard if you make it work its blissful but i also know a marriage that isnt working can be painful i couldnt have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mothers death the renewed energy the surprising sweetness of grief the tenderness i feel for strangers on walkers the deeper love i have for my siblings and friends the desire to play the mandolin the gift of a visitation you havent lost anything when you know were it is death can hide but not divide i think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty as far as my divorce goes i love my family and i love my wife to death and i just dont know what tomorrows going to bring i have had death threats from people with fixations loss and possession death and life are one there falls no shadow where there shines no sun people who are sick or who have been sick or have come close to death have a lot to say  and they want you to hear it living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life it helps you to live a less trivial life the line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do bulls can do nothing to demand justice they can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a predetermined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death its up to us as a civilized society to call for an end to the running of the bulls and bullfighting my faith isnt very churchy its a pretty personal intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death more than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they werent guilty or fairly tried most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them there is a lot that is wrong why would you be afraid of death it would be an inconvenience i have a lot of undone things and its bound to get in the way but no it doesnt scare me at all we weep over the graves of infants and the little ones taken from us by death but an early grave may be the shortest way to heaven everything that is necessary is also easy you just have to accept it and the most necessary the most natural matter on this planet is death i was ready to quit music it felt to me like music equalled death beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us a manifestation of eternity and a sign of death as well i really wanted to do something positive on the internet i wanted to try to get young people talking about thinking about lifes big questionsmake it cool and ok to wonder about the heart the soul and free will and god and death and big topics like that big human topics i think that the core doctrines of christianity  the incarnation the resurrection life after deaththese are as strong as ever in fact the belief in life after death has increased in this century of all the artists on death row none of them went bankrupt for any culture which is primarily concerned with meaning the study of death  the only certainty that life holds for us  must be central for an understanding of death is the key to liberation in life the study of consciousness that can extend beyond the body is extremely important for the issue of survival since it is this part of human personality that would be likely to survive death the motif of death plays an important role the human psyche in connection with archetypal and karmic material the materialistic paradigm of western science has been a major obstacle for any objective evaluation of the data describing the events occurring at the time of death the knowledge of the realm of death makes it possible for the shaman to move freely back and forth and mediate these journeys for other people the experiences associated with death were seen as visits to important dimensions of reality that deserved to be experienced studied and carefully mapped the elimination of the fear of death transforms the individuals way of being in the world research challenges the materialistic understanding of death according to which biological death represents the final end of existence and of all conscious activity individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives who seem to welcome them to the next world these deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition if consciousness can function independently of the body during ones lifetime it could be able to do the same after death dying before dying has two important consequences it liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise a number of cases have been reported in which a dying individual has a vision of a person about whose death he or she did not know the drink yes ive had tough times in my life especially the last year regarding my exwife my kids i nearly broke my neck i was on death row with pneumonia though i am a catholic a professing one i have serious doubts about the survival of the human personality after death im death obsessed you know i have death all over my house i have a stuffed two headed sheep since fame is an illusion and death is in our future all we have is the next moment before we are swallowed into oblivion of course we avoid death to know something is inevitable is one thing to accept to truly feel it thats different we all labor against our own cure for death is the cure of all diseases life itself is but the shadow of death and souls departed but the shadows of the living what is ironic is that allen ginsbergs importance was in its twilight for so many years that it took his death to bring it to the front page he electrified an entire world when i see someone who is starved they dont look alert they dont have boundless energy if youre too skinny it looks like youre near death american horror goes for a very specific kind of seventies suburban downer ambience  flowers in the attic paperbacks black sabbath album covers and latenight flicks like lets scare jessica to death it even has go ask aliceera urban legends people want the right to die at a time of their own choosing too many families have watched helplessly as a relative dies slowly longing for death when i die dont let my death stop the resistance its a matter of life and death for this country the kenyan forests are facing extinction and it is a manmade problem its something i want to overcome and my kids are scared to death to fly i want them to witness me overcome it death by starvation is slow libertarians know that a free country has nothing to fear from anyone coming in or going out  while a welfare state is scared to death of poor people coming in and rich people getting out women have not yet realized the cowardice that resides for if they should decide to do so they would be able to fight you until death and to prove that i speak the truth amongst so many women i will be the first to act setting an example for them to follow sickness insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my cradle and they have followed me throughout my life there are people who never experience that who remain closed until death from fear of change one of the big questions in the climate change debate are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot if you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat it wont jump out instead it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death we humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing in this situation i was constantly exposed to danger and death we were then in a dangerous helpless situation exposed daily to perils and death amongst savages and wild beasts not a white man in the country but ourselves i had always loved john fords pictures and i came to love him too but i was frightened to death working for him he used the shock treatment while directing me hitchcock had to fight to the death to make his movies after my mothers death i had such difficulty relating to people the supreme court of the united states has validated the nazi method of execution in concentration camps starving them to death i will admit like socrates and aristotle and plato and some other philosophers that there are instances where the death penalty would seem appropriate not one has shown an iota of fear of death they want to end this agony if christ can die in a barn i think the death of a human in a van is not so bad youve gotta know what death is to know life i hate to say this but ill repeat it after death all we know that you do is stink theres stuff i dont like to rehearse really emotional things i dont like to rehearse you just beat it to death im trying to knock the medical profession into accepting its responsibilities and those responsibilities include assisting their patients with death nobody with an iq higher than emergencyroom temperature could ever believe that death panels would be appointed to nudge the elderly toward euthanasia yet for idle entertainment its hard to beat sarah palins ignorant nattering on the subject the miser starving his brothers body starves also his own soul and at death shall creep out of his great estate of injustice poor and naked and miserable im not supposed to be able to speak clearly and decipher whats going on in the media im supposed to be the typical amateur whos 22 and scared to death and cant believe he won the olympics i stay way from that area and theres only so many songs you can write about love sex and death my death will be caused by morphine which i have deliberately taken with suicidal intent a shakespearean tragedy as so far considered may be called a story of exceptional calamity leading to the death of a man in high estate but it is clearly much more than this and we have now to regard it from another side the american people are not just being taxed to death theyre being taxed after death but no one should have to sell the lifes work of a parent or a loved one just to pay the federal government we worry about the seemingly everincreasing number of natural catastrophes yet this is mainly a consequence of cnn  we see many more but the number is roughly constant and we manage to deal much better with them over time globally the death rate from catastrophes has dropped about fiftyfold over the past century i am politically prochoice but personally prolife i have my faith but refuse to force it on the world at large  especially this world so brutal and unjust i cannot make these wrenching personal life and death decisions for others  nor do i believe they should be made by a church run by childless men and in a funny way each death is different and you mourn each death differently and each death brings back the death you mourned earlier and you get into a bit of a pileup we burned to death 100000 japanese civilians in tokyo  men women and children lemay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost but what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win its normally the kiss of death to be identified as a rising star or someone to watch i was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death you can go online and type chokeholds and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out you can hear what noises they make when they go unconscious see how their bodies flop and everything youtube is amazing for the more detailed stuff over the past 50 years we got versions of xray specs and space vacations and even death rays but the xray specs dont fit on your face  theyre big things that screen your luggage for guns space vacations are real but they cost 20 million we have death rays but you have to be a triple phd to play with them life is like a very short visit to a toyshop between birth and death they can rule the world while they can persuade us our pain belongs in some order is death by famine worse than death by suicide than a life of famine and suicide until the day of his death no man can be sure of his courage he who is obsessed by death is made guilty by it there is no such thing as an ugly language today i hear every language as if it were the only one and when i hear of one that is dying it overwhelms me as though it were the death of the earth the first novel i wrote was a monster  clocking in at 180000 words  but it died a death a death it deserved it was called the gods first make mad it was a good title but it was the only good thing about the book i didnt let that put me off i have sometimes imagined my own death and brought myself to tears any existence deprived of freedom is a kind of death but for me it is when a student has died i find the death of a young person the most difficult and painful of times to explain it to other young people to see a bright future snuffed out is just awful i am haunted by those deaths nothing is absolute with the debatable exceptions of this statement and death im watching the weather channel more than ive ever watched it im scared to death its going to rain nature creates while destroying and doesnt care whether it creates or destroys as long as life isnt extinguished as long as death doesnt lose its rights if you have fun fine its not all life and death when the courts decide that murderers rapists and others who maliciously break our social contract deserve health care that most working americans cant afford they are condemning good people to death people need jobs people need happy and successful lives there should be marriage between one man and one woman there should the value of person from conception until natural death it comes with faith for with complete faith there is no fear of what faces you in life or death i think life is sacred whether its abortion or the death penalty i am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend dudley moore instead of joyfully looking forward to my birth my mother began systematically preparing for her own death she was fatalistic cause at the end of the day honestly at the end of the day when youre in your death bed and thats it i think its the relationships youve had and the people that youve touched and the people that have touched you that matter as a comic you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death ive accentuated the look over the years as a comic you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death the writer crafts their ideal world in my world everyone has really long conversations or just picks apart pop culture to death and everyone talks in monologue our law is a jordanian law that we inherited which applies to both the west bank and gaza and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to israelis if i ever completely lost my nervousness i would be frightened half to death i think i might actually die of showing off itll be on my headstone  cause of death showing off when we have done our best we can as a united people take whatever may befall with calm courage and confidence that this old nation will survive and if death should come to many of us death is not the end i think to have the skill set and the ability to physically help others in matters of life and death must be incredibly empowering i dont think of death in a romantic way anymore to have been torn from the study would have been as death my time was entirely occupied with art when i was younger i wasnt concentrating on good days i was managing a career and trying to have a good year it would always lead to something which never leads to anything except death where everything leads to and then as i got older and then i had my kids and everything i began to appreciate a great wednesday if you wish to make a man look noble your best course is to kill him what superiority he may have inherited from his race what superiority nature may have personally gifted him with comes out in death death is the ugly fact which nature has to hide and she hides it well i like death im a big fan of it its certain that the death of an actor can be on a television screen playing the same thing every week in these dangerous times where it seems the world is ripping apart at the seams we can all learn how to survive from those who stare death squarely in the face every day and we should reach out to each other and bond as a community rather than hide from the terrors of life at the end of the millennium between our birth and death we may touch understanding as a moth brushes a window with its wing washington not jefferson freed his slaves upon his death there are some people who walk into a room and they oxygenate it by their very being theres fresh air then there are those who come in with the smell of death and they suck the life out when we play angel of death its actually a 2 and half minutes sing til our party starts that song is pretty much been played traditionally in the end patrick henry did not say give me absolutely safety or give me death america is supposed to be about freedom lots of people there seemed to be in denial in absolute denial of death  everybodys pretending that death doesnt happen in la if you do enough exercise and take enough wheatgrass and have your pill every day you might not die on the basis of biological sociological and historical knowledge we should recognize that the individual self is subject to death or decay but the sum total of individual achievement for better or worse lives on in the immortality of the larger i just dont get death at all yes its there but i dont get it i cant let my mothers death have been in vain democracy is the best revenge and we will have it you should celebrate the end of a love affair as they celebrate death in new orleans with songs laughter dancing and a lot of wine nothing is a matter of life and death except life and death he killed his enemies because he was afraid they would kill him amin ordered entire tribes to be put to death because he feared they would rebel to be clear climate change is a true 800 pound gorilla in the room the effects of global warming threaten global environmental upheaval over the coming century but for south florida and the everglades it could be our death knell if urgent action is not taken its funny though speaking of fathers and sons because me and john goodman played father and son like five or six years ago in the film death sentence and i got back with him again in inside llewyn davis you know ive never actually really believed that death is inevitable i just think its a rumor i rely on guns for protection in life god does not say this is lala land god doesnt say welcome to earth everythings perfect theres no crime theres no murder theres no death the world is imperfect and you have to be on guard i dont want to hear about my death the situation in the united states is becoming more dire for average ordinary americans and the last thing we need to do is to spend money on death destruction and war death doesnt frighten me now i can think peacefully of ending a long life defeat the fear of death and you welcome the death of fear the illness and the untimely death of my brothers has made me conscious of the fact that  rather than just think about it  its crucial that you do today what you want to do the cult of the individual is killing us i think twitter signals the death of western civilisation but people have been saying that since demosthenes you realize that however much you dont think about death  or think thats for other people  youre just an organism living from day to day im just grateful im here i think about death a lot i really do because i cant believe i wont exist its the ego isnt it i feel that i should retreat into a better form of zen buddhism than this kind of egodominated thing but i dont know i mean i want to come back as a tree but i suspect that its just not going to happen is it the die is set and malcolm will not escape for the foolish talk he spoke against his benefactor such a man is worthy of death and it would have been so were it not for muhammads confidence that god would give him the victory over the enemies if the human condition were the periodic table maybe love would be hydrogen at no 1 death would be helium at no 2 power i reckon would be where oxygen is any film which views the darker side of life which is death with a sense of humor is very much to my taste my death taking the light from my eyes gives back to the day the purity which they soiled heres a thing about the death of your mother or anyone else you love you cant anticipate how youll feel afterward people will tell you a few may be close to right none exactly right it is not death but dying which is terrible i believe the death of bobby kennedy was in many ways the death of decency in america i think it was the death of manners and formality the death of poetry and the death of a dream when i was on a major label i felt obliged to say yes to every interview tour and whatever else the label is always telling you this aint going to last so i worked myself half to death i learnt from that and i like to pace myself now most of the debate over the cultures of death and life is about process the debate focuses on the technology available to determine how we prolong life and how and when we end it if you think aficionados of a living constitution want to bring you flexibility think again you think the death penalty is a good idea persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it you want a right to abortion persuade your fellow citizens and enact it thats flexibility death is a very important part of life not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia there may be legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not with regard to abortion and euthanasia depakote also has a really bad side effect which is death i think that much of this was running in background as i contemplated whether or not to attend the ps 99 reunion although i certainly anticipated that i would not it smelled like death not youth as a reward for their efforts however those early christians were beaten stoned to death thrown to the lions tortured and crucified every conceivable method was used to stop them from talking the death penalty is being applied in the united states as a fatal lottery i was in two episodes playing christopher reeves characters emissary they wanted to have my character announce dr swans death which i thought was exploitative planning to play thats what saving for retirement is today  and it is antithetical to the nature of play fully within the definition of work and blissfully ignorant of the reality of death im not on the run from anything and im not at all clear about what im running towards but as some great writer put it i want to be certain that when i arrive at death im totally exhausted so here is one of my theories on happiness we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end this view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of philip gould philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics when he died i felt like i had lost a limb what we think of as our sensitivity is only the higher evolution of terror in a poor dumb beast we suffer for nothing our own death wish is our only real tragedy i start thinking about life after death ive got to quit thinking about it because its very deep very deep sometimes you start thinking about it and you dont feel like you want to be alive so i dont like to get all quiet when we are dealing with death we are constantly being dragged down by the event humor diverts our attention and lifts our sagging spirits
