a man who wont die for something is not fit to live to be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life foolish people are idle wise people are diligent the fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears for theres no risk of accident for someone whos dead the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time death is no more than passing from one room into another but theres a difference for me you know because in that other room i shall be able to see what we have done for ourselves alone dies with us what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal i didnt attend the funeral but i sent a nice letter saying i approved of it no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it is lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them while i thought that i was learning how to live i have been learning how to die life is hard then you die then they throw dirt in your face then the worms eat you be grateful it happens in that order suicide is mans way of telling god you cant fire me  i quit i saw few die of hunger of eating a hundred thousand death most resembles a prophet who is without honor in his own land or a poet who is a stranger among his people let no one weep for me or celebrate my funeral with mourning for i still live as i pass to and fro through the mouths of men the life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living the day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of eternity die v to stop sinning suddenly a friend who dies its something of you who dies no one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow they tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person i have never killed a man but i have read many obituaries with great pleasure for death is no more than a turning of us over from time to eternity a dying man needs to die as a sleepy man needs to sleep and there comes a time when it is wrong as well as useless to resist dying is easy its living that scares me to death death will be a great relief no more interviews i decided to devote my life to telling the story because i felt that having survived i owe something to the dead and anyone who does not remember betrays them again i am become death the destroyer of worlds ive told my children that when i die to release balloons in the sky to celebrate that i graduated for me death is a graduation those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body man always dies before he is fully born from my rotting body flowers shall grow and i am in them and that is eternity when youre dead youre dead thats it i had seen birth and death but had thought they were different death is a very dull dreary affair and my advice to you is to have nothing whatsoever to do with it because of indifference one dies before one actually dies millions long for immortality who dont know what to do with themselves on a rainy sunday afternoon call no man happy till he is dead do not fear death so much but rather the inadequate life cursed is the man who dies but the evil done by him survives a man does not die of love or his liver or even of old age he dies of being a man birth and death we all move between these two unknowns some people are so afraid do die that they never begin to live life is better than death i believe if only because it is less boring and because it has fresh peaches in it to himself everyone is immortal he may know that he is going to die but he can never know that he is dead pale death beats equally at the poor mans gate and at the palaces of kings men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased by tales so is the other since the day of my birth my death began its walk it is walking toward me without hurrying it is possible to provide security against other ills but as far as death is concerned we men live in a city without walls the dead cannot cry out for justice it is a duty of the living to do so for them the timing of death like the ending of a story gives a changed meaning to what preceded it of all the gods only death does not desire gifts tis very certain the desire of life prolongs it time rushes towards us with its hospital tray of infinitely varied narcotics even while it is preparing us for its inevitably fatal operation love and death are the two great hinges on which all human sympathies turn everything that gets born dies some men are alive simply because it is against the law to kill them the idea is to die young as late as possible death is the last enemy once weve got past that i think everything will be alright i shall not die of a cold i shall die of having lived all our knowledge merely helps us to die a more painful death than animals that know nothing healthy children will not fear life if their elders have integrity enough not to fear death nothing that is really good and godlike dies death borders upon our birth and our cradle stands in the grave any man who has 10000 left when he dies is a failure the words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living death is always around the corner but often our society gives it inordinate help man dies of cold not of darkness all architects want to live beyond their deaths he who doesnt fear death dies only once it was a time when only the dead smiled happy in their peace if you dont have any fight in you you might as well be dead even at our birth death does but stand aside a little and every day he looks towards us and muses somewhat to himself whether that day or the next he will draw nigh deaths in the goodbye for me habit is just a synonym for death he who is completely sanctified or cleansed from all sin and dies in this state is fit for glory we cannot banish dangers but we can banish fears we must not demean life by standing in awe of death when faith is lost when honor dies the man is dead john candy knew he was going to die he told me on his 40th birthday he said well maureen im on borrowed time hell madam is to love no longer death is the tyrant of the imagination the death of whats dead is the birth of whats living tradition demands that we not speak poorly of the dead fling but a stone the giant dies i do not agree with what you have to say but ill defend to the death your right to say it a nation or civilization that continues to produce softminded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan i love those who can smile in trouble who can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but they whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves their conduct will pursue their principles unto death people fear death even more than pain its strange that they fear death life hurts a lot more than death at the point of death the pain is over yeah i guess it is a friend if physical death is the price that i must pay to free my white brothers and sisters from a permanent death of the spirit then nothing can be more redemptive intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death without health life is not life it is only a state of langour and suffering  an image of death the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated even death is not to be feared by one who has lived wisely courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything  all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure  these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important do the thing you fear most and the death of fear is certain i am not afraid of death i just dont want to be there when it happens if you die youre completely happy and your soul somewhere lives on im not afraid of dying total peace after death becoming someone else is the best hope ive got i love the man that can smile in trouble that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death theres no tragedy in life like the death of a child things never get back to the way they were you can change your world by changing your words remember death and life are in the power of the tongue im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death i dont have no fear of death my only fear is coming back reincarnated there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws life is a process of becoming a combination of states we have to go through where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it this is a kind of death love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings the only difference between death and taxes is that death doesnt get worse every time congress meets death is a fearful thing the stroke of death is as a lovers pinch which hurts and is desired let us all be brave enough to die the death of a martyr but let no one lust for martyrdom fear of death makes us devoid both of valour and religion for want of valour is want of religious faith death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away i were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion one can survive everything nowadays except death and live down everything except a good reputation in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes the valiant never taste of death but once biography lends to death a new terror death may be the greatest of all human blessings i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge that myth is more potent than history that dreams are more powerful than facts that hope always triumphs over experience that laughter is the only cure for grief and i believe that love is stronger than death death comes to all but great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold for life and death are one even as the river and the sea are one i look upon death to be as necessary to our constitution as sleep we shall rise refreshed in the morning we are dying from overthinking we are slowly killing ourselves by thinking about everything think think think you can never trust the human mind anyway its a death trap in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart i simply cant build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion misery and death the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death death and life have their determined appointments riches and honors depend upon heaven an atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church an atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said an atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death he wants disease conquered poverty vanished war eliminated to run away from trouble is a form of cowardice and while it is true that the suicide braves death he does it not for some noble object but to escape some ill when your time comes to die be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way sing your death song and die like a hero going home life and death are one thread the same line viewed from different sides if we dont know life how can we know death do the thing we fear and death of fear is certain it is not death that a man should fear but he should fear never beginning to live if my survival caused another to perish then death would be sweeter and more beloved death is a challenge it tells us not to waste time it tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other the appeal of cinema lies in the fear of death each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death the kingdom of heaven is a condition of the heart  not something that comes upon the earth or after death whenever death may surprise us let it be welcome if our battle cry has reached even one receptive ear and another hand reaches out to take up our arms one death is a tragedy one million is a statistic let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life the living being is only a species of the dead and a very rare species ordinary people seem not to realize that those who really apply themselves in the right way to philosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death look i dont want to wax philosophic but i will say that if youre alive youve got to flap your arms and legs youve got to jump around a lot for life is the very opposite of death and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully or youre not alive there is no lonelier man in death except the suicide than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it people living deeply have no fear of death i postpone death by living by suffering by error by risking by giving by losing death is nothing but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily death is caused by swallowing small amounts of saliva over a long period of time the death of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into the deepest valleys look on them as your own beloved sons and they will stand by you even unto death i have thought there was some advantage even in death by which we mingle with the herd of common men at a formal dinner party the person nearest death should always be seated closest to the bathroom no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death life levels all men death reveals the eminent if you believe in god believe in death row east absence and death are the same  only that in death there is no suffering for centuries the death penalty often accompanied by barbarous refinements has been trying to hold crime in check yet crime persists why because the instincts that are warring in man are not as the law claims constant forces in a state of equilibrium it is better to risk starving to death then surrender if you give up on your dreams whats left men are convinced of your arguments your sincerity and the seriousness of your efforts only by your death love we say is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death death is not the worst that can happen to men there will one day spring from the brain of science a machine or force so fearful in its potentialities so absolutely terrifying that even man the fighter who will dare torture and death in order to inflict torture and death will be appalled and so abandon war forever it is not the end of the physical body that should worry us rather our concern must be to live while were alive  to release our inner selves from the spiritual death that comes with living behind a facade designed to conform to external definitions of who and what we are we get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking in that race which daily hastens us towards death the body maintains its irreparable lead death is not extinguishing the light it is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come there will be no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in social customs until death is outlawed a belief in hell and the knowledge that every ambition is doomed to frustration at the hands of a skeleton have never prevented the majority of human beings from behaving as though death were no more than an unfounded rumor you hear a lot about god these days god the beneficent god the allgreat god the almighty god the most powerful god the giver of life god the creator of death i mean were hearing about god all the time so we better learn how to deal with it but if we know anything about god god is arbitrary death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome the safest course is to do nothing against ones conscience with this secret we can enjoy life and have no fear from death death solves all problems  no man no problem death to me means nothing as long as i can die fast bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighters honor fear of death increases in exact proportion to increase in wealth we cast away priceless time in dreams born of imagination fed upon illusion and put to death by reality as a wellspent day brings happy sleep so a life well spent brings happy death achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death death is a release from the impressions of the senses and from desires that make us their puppets and from the vagaries of the mind and from the hard service of the flesh madame all stories if continued far enough end in death and he is no truestory teller who would keep that from you know one knows whether death which people fear to be the greatest evil may not be the greatest good personally i would be delighted if there were a life after death especially if it permitted me to continue to learn about this world and others if it gave me a chance to discover how history turns out must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death i simply cant build my hopes on a foundation of confusion misery and death i think peace and tranquillity will return again it is vain for the coward to flee death follows close behind it is only by defying it that the brave escape a useless life is an early death dependency is death to initiative to risktaking and opportunity its time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is despise not death but welcome it for nature wills it like all else give me liberty or give me death death is a commingling of eternity with time in the death of a good man eternity is seen looking through time because i could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me the carriage held but just ourselves and immortality in india we only read about death sickness terrorism crime the death of my father is probably the biggest thing that i ever faced daddy and i were best friends as long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant try to save your soul when death is immanent what can you do we all pay for life with death so everything in between should be free if a man can bridge the gap between life and death if he can live on after hes dead then maybe he was a great man im not afraid of death but im in no hurry to die i have so much i want to do first death like birth is a secret of nature there are worse things in life than death have you ever spent an evening with an insurance salesman an unused life is an early death justifying conscription to promote the cause of liberty is one of the most bizarre notions ever conceived by man forced servitude with the risk of death and serious injury as a price to live free makes no sense death is not an event in life we do not live to experience death if we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present if death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new character would you slow down or speed up when we have lost everything including hope life becomes a disgrace and death a duty whether you like it or not youre forced to come to the realisation that death is out there but i dont fear death im a fatalist i believe when its your time thats it its the hand youre dealt in our brief national history we have shot four of our presidents worried five of them to death impeached one and hounded another out of office and when all else fails we hold an election and assassinate their character theres something about death that is comforting the thought that you could die tomorrow frees you to appreciate your life now ive been looking at some video clips on youtube of president obama  then candidate obama  going through iowa making promises the gap between his promises and his performance is the largest ive seen well since the kardashian wedding and the promise of til death do we part any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee the death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush it will be a slow extinction from apathy indifference and undernourishment absolute silence leads to sadness it is the image of death prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts then until death itself comes no calamity need be feared there is no such thing as inner peace there is only nervousness or death any attempt to prove otherwise constitutes unacceptable behavior after your death you will be what you were before your birth death is the solution to all problems no man  no problem death is a distant rumor to the young foolish men imagine that because judgment for an evil thing is delayed there is no justice but only accident here below judgment for an evil thing is many times delayed some day or two some century or two but it is sure as life it is sure as death he who is the author of a war lets loose the whole contagion of hell and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death drown in a cold vat of whiskey death where is thy sting i know not what others may choose but as for me give me liberty or give me death guilt is perhaps the most painful companion of death i love the name of honor more than i fear death the us couldnt even get rid of saddam hussein and we all know that the eu is just a passing fad theyll be killing each other again in less than a year im sick to death of all these fascist lawsuits tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death if i think more about death than some other people it is probably because i love life more than they do love is anterior to life posterior to death initial of creation and the exponent of breath of all escape mechanisms death is the most efficient i had reasoned this out in my mind there was one of two things i had a right to liberty or death if i could not have one i would have the other no matter how prepared you think you are for the death of a loved one it still comes as a shock and it still hurts very deeply even very young children need to be informed about dying explain the concept of death very carefully to your child this will make threatening him with it much more effective other states are trying to abolish the death penalty mines putting in an express lane the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death death does not concern us because as long as we exist death is not here and when it does come we no longer exist you must not fear death my lads defy him and you drive him into the enemys ranks it is the cause not the death that makes the martyr i was not encouraged to follow the career of a writer because my parents thought that i was going to starve to death they thought nobody can make a living from being a writer in brazil they were not wrong marriage is the death of hope humanity should question itself once more about the absurd and always unfair phenomenon of war on whose stage of death and pain only remain standing the negotiating table that could and should have prevented it our life dreams the utopia our death achieves the ideal live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart the goal of all life is death i look forward to death with great anticipation to meeting god face to face the tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives  the death of genuine feeling the death of inspired response the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself where is the politician who has not promised to fight to the death for lower taxes and who has not proceeded to vote for the very spending projects that make tax cuts impossible death is not the end there remains the litigation over the estate we are not victims of aging sickness and death these are part of scenery not the seer who is immune to any form of change this seer is the spirit the expression of eternal being death is the wish of some the relief of many and the end of all belief is the death of intelligence a complainer is like a death eater because theres a suction of negative energy you can catch a great attitude from great people grumbling is the death of love our life is made by the death of others even in the valley of the shadow of death two and two do not make six the symbolic language of the crucifixion is the death of the old paradigm resurrection is a leap into a whole new way of thinking it is not death or pain that is to be dreaded but the fear of pain or death art is the tree of life science is the tree of death as men are not able to fight against death misery ignorance they have taken it into their heads in order to be happy not to think of them at all nothing can happen more beautiful than death the slave is doomed to worship time and fate and death because they are greater than anything he finds in himself and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour because of its tremendous solemnity death is the light in which great passions both good and bad become transparent no longer limited by outward appearences death and love are the two wings that bear the good man to heaven and i will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death there are as is known insects that die in the moment of fertilization so it is with all joy lifes highest most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death death so called is a thing which makes men weep and yet a third of life is passed in sleep the death of one man is a tragedy the death of millions is a statistic our nature consists in motion complete rest is death shrinking away from death is something unhealthy and abnormal which robs the second half of life of its purpose we need men with moral courage to speak and write their real thoughts and to stand by their convictions even to the very death since change is constant you wonder if people crave death because its the only way they can get anything really finished every parting gives a foretaste of death every reunion a hint of the resurrection on neither the sun nor death can a man look fixedly if i die prematurely i shall be saved from being bored to death at my own success if we have been pleased with life we should not be displeased with death since it comes from the hand of the same master sleep is the interest we have to pay on the capital which is called in at death and the higher the rate of interest and the more regularly it is paid the further the date of redemption is postponed even though people may be well known they hold in their hearts the emotions of a simple person for the moments that are the most important of those we know on earth birth marriage and death in every parting there is an image of death it is easy to go down into hell night and day the gates of dark death stand wide but to climb back again to retrace ones steps to the upper air  theres the rub the task death is the king of this world tis his park where he breeds life to feed him cries of pain are music for his banquet when death comes it is never our tenderness that we repent from but our severity the charm of fame is so great that we like every object to which it is attached even death on the plus side death is one of the few things that can be done as easily lying down  it is impossible to experience ones death objectively and still carry a tune when life is victorious there is birth when it is thwarted there is death a warrior is always engaged in a lifeanddeath struggle for peace watching a peaceful death of a human being reminds us of a falling star one of a million lights in a vast sky that flares up for a brief moment only to disappear into the endless night forever to some extent i liken slavery to death death is not natural for a state as it is for a human being for whom death is not only necessary but frequently even desirable it seems to me that if you or i must choose between two courses of thought or action we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world old age is a tyrant who forbids under pain of death the pleasures of youth neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye i have two luxuries to brood over in my walks your loveliness and the hour of my death o that i could have possession of them both in the same minute death is someone you see very clearly with eyes in the center of your heart eyes that see not by reacting to light but by reacting to a kind of a chill from within the marrow of your own life land and sea weakness and decline are great separators but death is the great divorcer for ever for a man who has done his natural duty death is as natural as sleep a revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past death may be the king of terrors but jesus is the king of kings death would not be called bad o people if one knew how to truly die i dont fear death because i dont fear anything i dont understand when i start to think about it i order a massage and it goes away when death the great reconciler has come it is never our tenderness that we repent of but our severity but when i lose my temper i find it difficult to forgive myself i feel ive failed i can be calm in a crisis in the face of death or things that hurt badly i dont get hysterical which may be masochistic of me life is but a moment death also is but another death unites as well as separates it silences all paltry feeling death not merely ends life it also bestows upon it a silent completeness snatched from the hazardous flux to which all things human are subject a new idea is delicate it can be killed by a sneer or a yawn it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right mans brow all violence consists in some people forcing others under threat of suffering or death to do what they do not want to do i balanced all brought all to mind the years to come seemed waste of breath a waste of breath the years behind in balance with this life this death man is born in a day and he dies in a day and the thing is easily over but to have a sick heart for threefourths of ones lifetime is simply to have death renewed every morning and life at that price is not worth living it is difficult to accept death in this society because it is unfamiliar in spite of the fact that it happens all the time we never see it death is just lifes next big adventure i would rather die a meaningful death than to live a meaningless life in the night of death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing generally speaking the way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death i like to behave in an extremely normal wholesome manner for the most part in my daily life even if mentally im consumed with sick visions of violence terror sex and death hearing nuns confessions is like being stoned to death with popcorn life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death if any foreign minister begins to defend to the death a peace conference you can be sure his government has already placed its orders for new battleships and airplanes my father was a man of love he always loved me to death he worked hard in the fields but my father never hit me never i dont ever remember a really cross unkind word from my father i thank my god for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness one is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become one lives ones death one dies ones life if life must not be taken too seriously then so neither must death whether for life or death do your own work well my fear was not of death itself but a death without meaning wild animals never kill for sport man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow creatures is amusing in itself the message that president obama delivered in his speech at notre dame was morality is immoral prolife is the extremist position not a moral position yet we should compromise and work to reduce abortions wheres the compromise between life and death  and why work to reduce the number of them occurring if theres nothing wrong with them true love makes the thought of death frequent easy without terrors it merely becomes the standard of comparison the price one would pay for many things there is nothing which at once affects a man so much and so little as his own death a man must be willing to die for justice death is an inescapable reality and men die daily but good deeds live forever i do not believe that any man fears to be dead but only the stroke of death once you accept your own death all of a sudden youre free to live you no longer care about your reputation you no longer care except so far as your life can be used tactically to promote a cause you believe in it is not death it is dying that alarms me those who have never had a father can at any rate never know the sweets of losing one to most men the death of his father is a new lease of life death is only a larger kind of going abroad the history of the world is the record of the weakness frailty and death of public opinion let us eat and drink neither forgetting death unduly nor remembering it the lord hath mercy on whom he will have mercy etc and the less we think about it the better i am able to follow my own death step by step now i move softly towards the end if you live a life of makebelieve your life isnt worth anything until you do something that does challenge your reality and to me sailing the open ocean is a real challenge because its life or death few cross the river of time and are able to reach nonbeing most of them run up and down only on this side of the river but those who when they know the law follow the path of the law they shall reach the other shore and go beyond the realm of death if i die a violent death as some fear and a few are plotting i know that the violence will be in the thought and the action of the assassins not in my dying disease generally begins that equality which death completes prepare for death if here at night you roam and sign your will before you sup from home if i take death into my life acknowledge it and face it squarely i will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life  and only then will i be free to become myself i would rather live and love where death is king than have eternal life where love is not im one of the slowest drivers on the road i mosey along if youre doing anything too fast including living life too fast that creates sudden death if i have to be somewhere on time i make sure i leave early enough absence from whom we love is worse than death and frustrates hope severer than despair creation destroys as it goes throws down one tree for the rise of another but ideal mankind would abolish death multiply itself million upon million rear up city upon city save every parasite alive until the accumulation of mere existence is swollen to a horror love has no age no limit and no death pale death with impartial step knocks at the hut of the poor and the towers of kings he has not lived badly whose birth and death has been unnoticed by the world bravery is the capacity to perform properly even when scared half to death for those who seek to understand it death is a highly creative force the highest spiritual values of life can originate from the thought and study of death some of us can be examples about going ahead and growing and some of us unfortunately dont make it there and end up being examples because they had to die i hit rock bottom but thank god my bottom wasnt death what i look forward to is continued immaturity followed by death death they say acquits us of all obligations the ceaseless labour of your life is to build the house of death that is the great mistake about the affections it is not the rise and fall of empires the birth and death of kings or the marching of armies that move them most when they answer from their depths it is to the domestic joys and tragedies of life mendacity is a system that we live in liquor is one way out an deaths the other we sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream it may be so the moment after death creativity is not merely the innocent spontaneity of our youth and childhood it must also be married to the passion of the adult human being which is a passion to live beyond ones death if you have only one passion in life  football  and you pursue it to the exclusion of everything else it becomes very dangerous when you stop doing this activity it is as though you are dying the death of that activity is a death in itself when the will defies fear when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate when honor scorns to compromise with death  that is heroism some people think football is a matter of life and death i assure you its much more serious than that in the attempt to defeat death man has been inevitably obliged to defeat life for the two are inextricably related life moves on to death and to deny one is to deny the other death is delightful death is dawn the waking from a weary night of fevers unto truth and light im sick to death of people saying weve made 11 albums that sounds exactly the same infact weve made 12 albums that sound exactly the same hunger revenge to sleep are petty foes but only death the jealous eyes can close people have their own deaths as well as their own lives and even if there is nothing beyond death we shall differ in our nothingness death destroys a man but the idea of death saves him men do not accept their prophets and slay them but they love their martyrs and worship those whom they have tortured to death dont be afraid to feel as angry or as loving as you can because when you feel nothing its just death in order to go on living one must try to escape the death involved in perfectionism we do not celebrate the death of our enemies a country that relies on aid death is better than that it stops you from achieving your potential just as colonialism did death be not proud though some have called thee mighty and dreadful for thou art not so for those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me kurt and i werent the closest of friends but i knew him well enough to be devastated by his death for such a quiet person he was so excited about having a child the teutons have been singing the swan song ever since they entered the ranks of history they have always confounded truth with death divorce is probably as painful as death death has a tendency to encourage a depressing view of war i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it im irish i think about death all the time what you possess in the world will be found at the day of your death to belong to someone else but what you are will be yours forever the very essence of literature is the war between emotion and intellect between life and death when literature becomes too intellectual  when it begins to ignore the passions the emotions  it becomes sterile silly and actually without substance which death is preferably to every other the unexpected i mean whatever kills you kills you and your death is authentic no matter how you die not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia there may be legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not with regard to abortion and euthanasia the darkness of death is like the evening twilight it makes all objects appear more lovely to the dying ive looked that old scoundrel death in the eye many times but this time i think he has me on the ropes death is the only pure beautiful conclusion of a great passion death doesnt affect the living because it has not happened yet death doesnt concern the dead because they have ceased to exist a tragedy need not have blood and death its enough that it all be filled with that majestic sadness that is the pleasure of tragedy there is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval the fear of death often proves mortal and sets people on methods to save their lives which infallibly destroy them theres nothing wrong in suffering if you suffer for a purpose our revolution didnt abolish danger or death it simply made danger and death worthwhile as long as you have capital punishment there is no guarantee that innocent people wont be put to death in every death a busy world comes to an end defoe says that there were a hundred thousand country fellows in his time ready to fight to the death against popery without knowing whether popery was a man or a horse it is old age rather than death that is to be contrasted with life old age is lifes parody whereas death transforms life into a destiny in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension death does away with time here i am trying to live or rather i am trying to teach the death within me how to live for death is not the worst but when one wants to die and is not able even to have that if forgers and malefactors are put to death by the secular power there is much more reason for excommunicating and even putting to death one convicted of heresy if what you do is being threatened as a profession that could be scary but thats the same reason why i walked out on stage many times after receiving death threats i couldnt live without doing what i wanted to do so at the same time i have to be willing to die for it and as long as youre subject to birth and death youll never attain enlightenment good music comes out of people playing together knowing what they want to do and going for it you have to sweat over it and bug it to death you cant do it by pushing buttons and watching a tv screen a real hangover is nothing to try out family remedies on the only cure for a real hangover is death the human consciousness is really homogeneous there is no complete forgetting even in death death never takes the wise man by surprise he is always ready to go as a well spent day brings happy sleep so life well used brings happy death death is frightening and so is eternal life to have the truth in your possession you can be found guilty sentenced to death communism is the death of the soul it is the organization of total conformity  in short of tyranny  and it is committed to making tyranny universal for the wretched one night is like a thousand for someone faring well death is just one more night not even old age knows how to love death i look at death proof and realize i had too much time death comes at you no matter what you do in this life and to equate drugs with death is a facile comparison a man who cannot be enticed by money or intimidated by the threat of jail or death has two of the strongest weapons that anyone has to offer the government is tottering we must deal it the death blow an any cost to delay action is the same as death i was courtmartialled in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence so i said they could shoot me in my absence the leading cause of death among fashion models is falling through street grates the true face of smoking is disease death and horror  not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray my fathers death my move and my frightening and difficult delivery created a tremendous amount of stress pain and sadness for me i was practically devastated beyond recovery death is really a great blessing for humanity without it there could be no real progress people who lived for ever would not only hamper and discourage the young but they would themselves lack sufficient stimulus to be creative to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure sleep is good death is better but of course the best thing would to have never been born at all all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues freedom well to the people who pray for me to not only have an agonising death but then be reborn to have an agonising and horrible eternal life of torture i say well good on you see you there i have more than once in my time woken up feeling like death no true believer could be intolerant or a persecutor if i were a magistrate and the law carried the death penalty against atheists i would begin by sending to the stake whoever denounced another the fear of death comes from limited awareness i went to medical school because i wanted to ask the big questions do we have a soul does god exist what happens after death every spiritual tradition has this idea of death and resurrection its not unique to christianity all i want is a gentleman im sick to bloody death of bastards crucial to understanding federalism in modern day america is the concept of mobility or the ability to vote with your feet if you dont support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol  dont come to texas if you dont like medicinal marijuana and gay marriage dont move to california it is impossible that anything so natural so necessary and so universal as death should ever have been designed by providence as an evil to mankind communism possesses a language which every people can understand  its elements are hunger envy and death death is the liberator of him whom freedom cannot release the physician of him whom medicine cannot cure and the comforter of him whom time cannot console death is one moment and life is so many of them a pun does not commonly justify a blow in return but if a blow were given for such cause and death ensued the jury would be judges both of the facts and of the pun and might if the latter were of an aggravated character return a verdict of justifiable homicide man as long as he lives is immortal one minute before his death he shall be immortal but one minute later god wins death obsesses me yes it does i cant really understand why it doesnt obsess everyone  i think it does really im just a little more out about it prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide the nearer people approach old age the closer they return to a semblance of childhood until the time comes for them to depart this life again like children neither tired of living nor aware of death like all of us in this storm between birth and death i can wreak no great changes on the world only small changes for the better i hope in the lives of those i love it is a sign of creeping inner death when we can no longer praise the living football soccer is a matter of life and death except more important death is not the biggest fear we have our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive  the risk to be alive and express what we really are i never really got on that well with yoko anyway strangely enough i only started to get to know her after johns death the rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated take care of your life and the lord will take care of your death those who welcome death have only tried it from the ears up i mean in the south african case many of those who were part of death squads would have been respectable members of their white community people who went to church on sunday every sunday an evil life is a kind of death death is less bitter punishment than deaths delay my life comes down to three moments the death of my father meeting my husband and the birth of my daughter everything i did previous to that just doesnt seem to add up to very much how strange this fear of death is we are never frightened at a sunset i feel monotony and death to be almost the same whether or not we believe in survival of consciousness after death reincarnation and karma it has very serious implications for our behavior a man may devote himself to death and destruction to save a nation but no nation will devote itself to death and destruction to save mankind we want our idols to be dead because it makes death a much less scary place not the torturer will scare me nor the bodys final fall nor the barrels of deaths rifles nor the shadows on the wall nor the night when to the ground the last dim star of pain is hurled but the blind indifference of a merciless unfeeling world only a humanity to whom death has become as indifferent as its members that has itself died can inflict it administratively on innumerable people normality is death birth was the death of him death is the sound of distant thunder at a picnic death is easier than a wretched life and better never to have born than to live and fare badly when i came back to dublin i was courtmartialed in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence so i said they could shoot me in my absence generosity during life is a very different thing from generosity in the hour of death one proceeds from genuine liberality and benevolence the other from pride or fear an unemployed existence is a worse negation of life than death itself faithfulness to the past can be a kind of death above ground writing of the past is a resurrection the past then lives in your words and you are free as far as thinking about death and murder and various ways of killing people and how people die i probably have the most twisted mind in slayer it has ever been since time began and ever will be till time lose breath that love is a mood  no more  to man and love to a woman is life or death poor georgia okeeffe death didnt soften the opinions of the art world toward her paintings and yet i suppose you mourn the loss or the death of what you thought your life was even if you find your life is better after you mourn the future that you thought youd planned death is the veil which those who live call life they sleep and it is lifted death is an absolute marvel we live in grief for having left the womb for having left the teat then school then home in my case it was leaving marriages and the death of my wife madness need not be all breakdown it may also be breakthrough it is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death success is like death the more successful you become the higher the houses in the hills get and the higer the fences get once you start doing only what youve already proven you can do youre on the road to death death gives us sleep eternal youth and immortality all societies on the verge of death are masculine a society can survive with only one man no society will survive a shortage of women death is softer by far than tyranny for children preserve the fame of a man after his death smiles tears of all my life  and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death being an old maid is like death by drowning a really delightful sensation after you cease to struggle pain and death are part of life to reject them is to reject life itself mcveighs lawyer got him the death penalty which quite frankly i could have done i dont want to get into the whos a hostagetaker discussion here but what is the estate tax its a double tax on death economists will tell you that its really not a tax that soaks the rich but its a tax on capital that deprives business investment and therefore job creation do not seek death death will find you but seek the road which makes death a fulfillment life is a great sunrise i do not see why death should not be an even greater one every parting is a form of death as every reunion is a type of heaven an important consequence of freeing oneself from the fear of death is a radical opening to spirituality of a universal and nondenominational type man has but three events in his life to be born to live and to die he is not conscious of his birth he suffers at his death and he forgets to live rock and menopause do not mix it is not good it sucks and every day i fight it to the death or at the very least not let it take me over in the first book of my discworld series published more than 26 years ago i introduced death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this  death has featured in art and literature since medieval times and for centuries we have had a fascination with the grim reaper death was like love a romantic escape we have abolished the death penalty for humans so why should it continue for animals i dont believe in life after death but i do believe in some grinding destiny that watches over us on earth if i didnt the safety valve would give and the boiler would explode no society has been able to abolish human sadness no political system can deliver us from the pain of living from our fear of death our thirst for the absolute it is the human condition that directs the social condition not vice versa a text of tibetan buddhism describes the time of death as a unique opportunity for spiritual liberation from the cycles of death and rebirth and a period that determines our next incarnation life and death are important dont suffer them in vain the acceptance of death gives you more of a stake in life in living life happily as it should be lived living for the moment that which is so universal as death must be a benefit the call of death is a call of love death can be sweet if we answer it in the affirmative if we accept it as one of the great eternal forms of life and transformation what is the value of sticking a microphone in a mans face right after he has learned of his wifes death i offer neither pay nor quarters nor food i offer only hunger thirst forced marches battles and death let him who loves his country with his heart and not merely with his lips follow me i think about death a lot like i think we all do i dont think of suicide as an option but as fun its an interesting idea that you can control how you go its this thing thats looming and you can control it til the infallibility of human judgements shall have been proved to me i shall demand the abolition of the penalty of death an insatiable appetite for glory leads to sacrifice and death but innate instinct leads to selfpreservation and life nothing in life is promised except death salman rushdie indeed any writer who abuses the prophet or indeed any prophet under islamic law the sentence for that is actually death dont be afraid of death so much as an inadequate life of emotions of love of breakup of love and hate and death and dying mama apple pie and the whole thing it covers a lot of territory country music does the ideal death i think is what was the ideal victorian death you know with your grandchildren around you a bit of sobbing and you say goodbye to your loved ones making certain that one of them has been left behind to look after the shop ill keep peace at all cost even if i choke to death on my tongue it is natural to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes to that siren until she allures us to our death just as i shall select my ship when i am about to go on a voyage or my house when i propose to take a residence so i shall choose my death when i am about to depart from life days will prove that the assassination policy will not finish the hamas hamas leaders wish to be martyrs and are not scared of death jihad will continue and the resistance will continue until we have victory or we will be martyrs death is the great hope of all life the desire to expend itself to be used and consumed by its own longing for itself our criminal justice system is fallible we know it even though we dont like to admit it it is fallible despite the best efforts of most within it to do justice and this fallibility is at the end of the day the most compelling persuasive and winning argument against a death penalty death is the golden key that opens the palace of eternity long hair is an unpardonable offense which should be punishable by death the kids out there want something they can relate to something thats real most of that whiny stuff isnt real the cheesy pop songs just bore me to death i was brought up by very witty people who were dealing with quite difficult things disease and death i was brought up by people who tended to giggle at funerals life without idealism is empty indeed we just hope or starve to death everything tends to make us believe that there exists a certain point of the mind at which life and death the real and the imagined past and future the communicable and the incommunicable high and low cease to be perceived as contradictions i have no fear of death more important i dont fear life o death rock me asleep bring me to quiet rest let pass my weary guiltless ghost out of my careful breast death comes in a flash and thats the truth of it the persons gone in less than 24 frames of film at the moment of death i hope to be surprised i was courtmartial in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence so i said they could shoot me in my absence inactivity is death youve never seen death look in the mirror every day and you will see it like bees working in a glass hive after the writers death reading his journal is like receiving a long letter the day of my birth my death began its walk it is walking toward me without hurrying everybody is entertained to death talk to people in their own language if you do it well theyll say god he said exactly what i was thinking and when they begin to respect you theyll follow you to the death i was very sad to hear of the death of ronnie barker who was such a warm friendly and encouraging presence to have when i started in television he was also a great comic actor to learn from the world is put back by the death of every one who has to sacrifice the development of his or her peculiar gifts to conventionality i am not the born how can there be either birth or death for me the desire to die was my one and only concern to it i have sacrificed everything even death life inspires more dread than death  it is life which is the great unknown buddhas move freely through birth and death appearing and disappearing at will we were aware of the fact that death walks hand in hand with struggle it is not tolerable it is not possible that from so much death so much sacrifice and ruin so much heroism a greater and better humanity shall not emerge if your best friend has stolen your girlfriend it does become life and death im possibly a very morbid person but i think about death a lot quarreling over food and drink having neither scruples nor shame not knowing right from wrong not trying to avoid death or injury not fearful of greater strength or of greater numbers greedily aware only of food and drink  such is the bravery of the dog and boar i grew up in the suburbs and basically associate the suburbs with cultural death you know americans are obsessed with life and death and rebirth thats the american cycle you know awakening tragic horrible death and then phoenix rising from the ashes thats the american story again and again i was fantasising about my own death i started thinking what my funeral would be like and what music would be played i was at that level of insanity andrew woods death changed things for a few weeks i probably got even heavier into drugs after that only in death will i relinquish my belts benjamin franklin said there were only two things certain in life death and taxes but id like to add a third certainty trash and while some in this room might want to discuss reducing taxes i want to talk about reducing trash when you break up your whole identity is shattered its like death deep down no one really believes they have a right to live but this death sentence generally stays tucked away hidden beneath the difficulty of living if that difficulty is removed from time to time death is suddenly there unintelligibly nothing endears so much a friend as sorrow for his death the pleasure of his company has not so powerful an influence i saw also that there was an ocean of darkness and death but an infinite ocean of light and love which flowed over the ocean of darkness there is something about poverty that smells like death as long as you dont make waves ripples life seems easy but thats condemning yourself to impotence and death before you are dead if shaw and einstein couldnt beat death what chance have i got practically none if some persons died and others did not die death would be a terrible affliction the passion of hatred is so long lived and so obstinate a malady that the surest sign of death in a sick person is their desire for reconciliation there are only three events in a mans life birth life and death he is not conscious of being born he dies in pain and he forgets to live old age calm expanded broad with the haughty breadth of the universe old age flowing free with the delicious nearby freedom of death everything one does in life even love occurs in an express train racing toward death to smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving it is to concern oneself with something other than life or death people praise virtue but they hate it they run away from it it freezes you to death and in this world youve got to keep your feet warm families survive one way or another you have a tie a connection that exists long after death through many lifetimes see i have set before you this day life and good death and evil i have set before you life and death blessing and curse therefore choose life death in itself is nothing but we fear to be we know not what we know not where for those who live neither with religious consolations about death nor with a sense of death or of anything else as natural death is the obscene mystery the ultimate affront the thing that cannot be controlled it can only be denied death is with you all the time you get deeper in it as you move towards it but its not unfamiliar to you its always been there so what becomes unfamiliar to you when you pass away from the moment is really life people think celebrities dont have to worry about human things like sickness and death and rent its like youve traveled to this land of celebrity this other country they want you to tell about what you saw the essence of the hebrew bible transmitted by christianity is separation between life and death nature and god good and evil man and woman and the holy and the profane when i listen to music i dont want to hear about flowers i like death and destruction in the last analysis it is our conception of death which decides our answers to all the questions that life puts to us the compact which exists between the north and the south is a covenant with death and an agreement with hell his death was the first time that ed wynn ever made anyone sad but i was very very lucky and it was a wake up call as far as motorbikes are concerned i never flirted with death on the bike but now im totally convinced theyre death machines to be honest im scared to death of rollercoaster rides there is no fundamental difference between the preparation for death and the practice of dying and spiritual practice leading to enlightenment i was blessed with a birth and a death and i guess i just want some say in between all those vitamins arent to keep death at bay theyre to keep deterioration at bay no one else can take risks for us or face our losses on our behalf or give us selfesteem no one can spare us from lifes slings and arrows and when death comes we meet it alone my mortal foe can no ways wish me a greater harm than englands hate neither should death be less welcome unto me than such a mishap betide me the meaning of life is not to be discovered only after death in some hidden mysterious realm on the contrary it can be found by eating the succulent fruit of the tree of life and by living in the here and now as fully and creatively as we can death is not more certainly a separation of our souls from our bodies than the christian life is a separation of our souls from worldly tempers vain indulgences and unnecessary cares i dont think kids have a problem with death its us older ones who are nearer to it that start being frightened the great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation and the great goal of the conservative movement as it rose to triumph in the 1980s was to remove that threat  to keep osha the epa and the ftc from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace life is doubt and faith without doubt is nothing but death the death of pope john paul ii led many of different faiths and of no faith to acknowledge their debt to the roman catholic church for holding on to absolutes that the rest of us can measure ourselves against you dont have people chanting death to america in israel the earth is rocky and full of roots its clay and it seems doomed and polluted but you dig little holes for the ugly shriveled bulbs throw in a handful of poppy seeds and cover it all over and you know youll never see it again  its death and clay and shrivel and your hands are nicked from the rocks your nails black with soil the death of any man aged 56 is very sad for his widow and family and no one would deny that steve jobs was a brilliant and highly innovative technician with great business flair and marketing ability im scared to death of being poor its like a fat girl who loses 500 pounds but is always fat inside i grew up poor and will always feel poor inside its my pet paranoia your body must become familiar with its death  in all its possible forms and degrees  as a selfevident imminent and emotionally neutral step on the way towards the goal you have found worthy of your life death is a billiondollar business they cant even pass a law where it takes seven days to get a gun why dont you have to go through the same kind of screening you do to get a drivers license its totally insane as a kid all i thought about was death but you cant tell your parents that the death penalty is becoming a way of life in this country i mean im 48 years old and ive been through a lot in my life  you know loss whether it be death illness separation i mean the failed expectations we all have dreams death comes not to the living soul nor age to the loving heart im working myself to death at the new york athletic club they serve amazing food people go there get healthy and then eat themselves to death  which is i suppose the right way to do it property is unstable and youth perishes in a moment life itself is held in the grinning fangs of death yet men delay to obtain release from the world alas the conduct of mankind is surprising well theres a remedy for all things but death which will be sure to lay us flat one time or other old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death life and death they are somehow sweetly and beautifully mixed but i dont know how doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded uzi im sick to death of famous people standing up and using their celebrity to promote a cause if i see a particular need i do try to help but theres a lot that can be achieved by putting a check in the right place and shutting up about it life is a predicament which precedes death death is the easiest of all things after it and the hardest of all things before it death is inevitable but life  thats the tricky bit where things happen she looks like a warrior i mean bellatrix does mean warrior and shes also a bit of a fatale shes the right hand of voldemort and the only woman death eater people think celebrities dont have to worry about human things like sickness and death and rent its like youve traveled to this land of celebrity this other country for the sake of goodness and love man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts i cant turn on the television without seeing me or open the newspaper without seeing me and honestly im sick to death of me he who does not fear death cares naught for threats to die for ones country is such a worthy fate that all compete for so beautiful a death each instant of life is a step toward death you always think that 70 is the end of the road somebody died when they were 73 good life youre closer to death and you better make sure you dont waste too much of your time doing things you dont want to do no point in saying things you dont believe in when im lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me science without conscience is the death of the soul had it not been for slavery the death penalty would have likely been abolished in america slavery became a haven for the death penalty so much of motion is so much of life and so much of joy and to stand still or get on but slowly is death and the devil death is the mother of beauty hence from her alone shall come fulfillment to our dreams and our desires in sleep we lie all naked and alone in sleep we are united at the heart of night and darkness and we are strange and beautiful asleep for we are dying the darkness and we know no death if efforts to do social work are couched in selfish motives then they will die a premature death why would my efforts get politicised i have values i inherited from my father he helped many anyone even a postman knocking on our door would get a glass of water and some sweets but i have been in some very beautiful churches then ive looked outside and seen people starving to death for tis not in mere death that men die most the greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase let no one be called happy till his death to which i would add let no one till his death be called unhappy the wages of sin are death but by the time taxes are taken out its just sort of a tired feeling not ignorance but ignorance of ignorance is the death of knowledge i believe that his death and resurrection transformed humanitys relationship with god islam is a religion of success unlike christianity which has as its main image in the west at least a man dying in a devastating disgraceful helpless death become an internationalist and learn to respect all life make war on machines and in particular the sterile machines of corporate death and the robots that guard them does not the very word creative mean to build to initiate to give out to act  rather than to be acted upon to be subjective living photography is positive in its approach it sings a song of life  not death death is an absolute mystery we are all vulnerable to it its what makes life interesting and suspenseful its just as idiotic to say there is no life after death as it is to say there is one knowing how to die is knowing how to live what is death anyway its the outcome of life when i did bumbleardy i was so intensely aware of death eugene my friend and partner was dying here in the house when i did bumbleardy i did bumbleardy to save myself i did not want to die with him i wanted to live as any human being does im not afraid of death the distinctions of fine art bore me to death as a kid all i thought about was death when theater becomes a soothing middleclass thing when its packaged as the night out then thats the death of it living is a sickness to which sleep provides relief every sixteen hours its a palliative the remedy is death monarchs ought to put to death the authors and instigators of war as their sworn enemies and as dangers to their states death is a delightful hiding place for weary men the enemy fought with savage fury and met death with all its horrors without shrinking or complaining not one asked to be spared but fought as long as they could stand or sit i know im drinking myself to a slow death but then im in no hurry for days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow but phone calls taper off it is a horrible fact that we can read in the daily paper without interrupting our breakfast numerical reckonings of death and destruction that ought to break our hearts or scare us out of our wits ive always been scared to death of pain  afraid even to think of it policemen so cherish their status as keepers of the peace and protectors of the public that they have occasionally been known to beat to death those citizens or groups who question that status at a certain age death becomes familiar to youor a loss becomes familiarthe tragedies that are more commonplace in life loved you cant use it in the past tense death does not stop that love at all have an earnestness for death and you will have life there is no harm in patience and no profit in lamentation death is easier to bear than that which precedes it and more severe than that which comes after it remember the death of the apostle of god and your sorrow will be lessened you can cry about death and very properly so your own as well as anybody elses but its inevitable so youd better grapple with it and cope and be aware that not only is it inevitable but it has always been inevitable if you see what i mean sinful and forbidden pleasures are like poisoned bread they may satisfy appetite for the moment but there is death in them at the end im very comfortable with the nature of life and death and that we come to an end whats most difficult to imagine is that those dreams and early yearnings and desires of childhood and adolescence will also disappear but who knows maybe you become part of the eternal whatever if you make every game a life and death proposition youre going to have problems for one thing youll be dead a lot its an incredible con job when you think about it to believe something now in exchange for something after death even corporations with their reward systems dont try to make it posthumous yes people pull the trigger  but guns are the instrument of death gun control is necessary and delay means more death and horror disease insanity and death were the angels that attended my cradle and since then have followed me throughout my life people always say that pregnant women have a glow and i say its because youre sweating to death the end of the animal trade would leave more time to trap or beat to death pop star wannabes we are weak writing is difficult but for my own sake i do not regret this journey which has shown that englishmen can endure hardships help one another and meet death with as great a fortitude as ever in the past the sole equality on earth is death i put for the general inclination of all mankind a perpetual and restless desire of power after power that ceaseth only in death without fullness of experience length of days is nothing when fullness of life has been achieved shortness of days is nothing that is perhaps why the young have usually so little fear of death they live by intensities that the elderly have forgotten i intend to leave after my death a large fund for the promotion of the peace idea but i am skeptical as to its results sleep is lovely death is better still not to have been born is of course the miracle life isnt fair its just fairer than death thats all i feel like i dont watch that many shows with death consciousness after death demonstrates the possibility of consciousness operating independently of the body whenever i watch tv and see those poor starving kids all over the world i cant help but cry i mean id love to be skinny like that but not with all those flies and death and stuff when applied to politics and taken to its extreme kitsch is the mask of death fascism was all aesthetics there was no core principle to it there was no truth to it all interest in disease and death is only another expression of interest in life i love this pedal to death the only way you could keep me from playing one is by chopping off my legs even when youre making a movie about life death is a presence and i guess its part of my dramatic viewpoint im not sure why exactly maybe im drawn to it as a story element once a disease has entered the body all parts which are healthy must fight it not one alone but all because a disease might mean their common death nature knows this and nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster people can undergo a sudden change of thinking and loyalties under threat of death or intense social pressure and isolation from friends and family its not the normal way to look at things but i experienced death at a really young age and because of that its been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible i made a supreme effort not to do that thing that parents do which is to bore people without children to death by going on and on about how funny their children are so theres none of that hopefully courage is the art of being the only one who knows youre scared to death death the final triumphant lover i believe that people would be alive today if there were a death penalty for three days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow but phone calls taper off my brother was a great favorite with everybody and his death cast a gloom upon the whole neighborhood so for twelve miles i rode with sherman and we became fast friends he asked me all manner of questions on the way and i found that he knew my father well and remembered his tragic death in salt creek valley tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death when a life has been lived completely honestly completely successfully or just completely the correct response to deaths perfect punctuation mark is a smile life cant defeat a writer who is in love with writing for life itself is a writers lover until death when sudden death takes a president opportunities for new beginnings flourish among the ambitious and the tensions among such people can be dramatic as they were when president kennedy was killed death is the final wakeup call as the fly bangs against the window attempting freedom while the door stands open so we bang against death ignoring heaven i am bound to add that the excess in too little has ever proved in me more dangerous than the excess in too much the last may cause indigestion but the first causes death to appear on the stage drunk to have them leave there and remember me making drunken mistakes that was death we have a limit a very discouraging humiliating limit death a face to lose youth for to occupy age with the dream of meet death with i think the amazing thing about gospel music is that not only does it lift up the death and resurrection of our lord which is consistent with the gospel but it is uniquely communicated depending upon the generation there are certain people that are marked for death i have my little list of those that treated me unfairly judged by the law of england i know this crime entails upon me the penalty of death but the history of ireland explains that crime and justifies it we do not choose the day of our birth nor may we choose the day of our death yet choice is the sovereign faculty of the mind but there is a difference here when jewish children are murdered arabs celebrate the deed the death of an arab child is no cause for celebration in israel im in awe of people out there who deal with alzheimers because they have to deal with death 10 times over year after year failure too is a form of death we know the road to freedom has always been stalked by death the thing about death is that its honest i think the way we talk about cancer has really evolved i remember the way my grandmother used to talk about it like a death sentence noone would even mention the word i really enjoy theater i just went to see death of a salesman and it knocked me on my ass i was extended secret service protection during my presidential run in 1984 when i received the most death threats ever made toward a candidate my mother was the sweetest lady who ever lived on this planet but if you tried to tell her that jesus wasnt a christian she would stomp you to death the disembodied spirit is immortal there is nothing of it that can grow old or die but the embodied spirit sees death on the horizon as soon as its day dawns constantly risking absurdity and death whenever he performs above the heads of his audience the poet like an acrobat climbs on rhyme to a high wire of his own making im more afraid of marriage than death pay mind to your own life your own health and wholeness a bleeding heart is of no help to anyone if it bleeds to death i get scared to death when i see people who say theyve found jesus christ and theyre out there and i wonder whos teaching them whos mentoring them to say yes you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and plunge both hands into life up to the elbows it is easy to say no even if saying no means death giving is good but taking is bad and brings death death is the sanction of everything the storyteller can tell he has borrowed his authority from death im not afraid of death its the stake one puts up in order to play the game of life to eat bread without hope is still slowly to starve to death art has two constant two unending concerns it always meditates on death and thus always creates life all great genuine art resembles and continues the revelation of st john i mean death is a serious thing certainly not to be sneezed at long hair is an unpardonable offence which should be punishable by death men should be bewailed at their birth and not at their death we are now operating a school system in america thats more segregated than at any time since the death of martin luther king in my solitude i have pondered much on the incomprehensible subjects of space eternity life and death it is love not reason that is stronger than death the only religious way to think of death is as part and parcel of life death valley is really wideopen  its bigger than rhode island  and its less a part of california than an ungoverned territory so theres lots of weird copsandrobbers stuff going on even when youre making a movie about life death is a presence and i guess its part of my dramatic viewpoint im not sure why exactly lidia bastianich sorry but kind of boring i mean i love lidia but you can fall asleep watching her and mario batali i love mario to death but hes not romantic or sensual those are the things i bring to the table to a billion people around the world surviving on just a dollar a day the question of what to eat tonight is more about life and death than about recipes the struggle of poor people around the globe weighs heavily on me especially now that i am a mother which is why i work with oxfam i just finished my homework fast i was bored to death there wasnt 500 channels so there was a thing for a librarian to teach a kid like me about reading i started reading early and i read all the time because i love it i think prince should open up a little more to other artists just because we love prince especially the old stuff  we love him to death but if he opened up he would be something to deal with imagine kanye west producing a prince track it would be banoodles death ends a life not a relationship we march and fight to death or on to victory our might is right no traitors shall prevail our hearts are steeled against the fiery gates of hell no shot or shell can still our mighty song fear was absolutely necessary without it i would have been scared to death everybody thinks im at deaths door but im not theres nothing seriously wrong with me and my heart is in 100 percent working order anything else you may hear is a damn lie death is an endless night so awful to contemplate that it can make us love life and value it with such passion that it may be the ultimate cause of all joy and all art i mean sting is one of my great buddies and i love him to death but the issue is not only life and death but our existence before god and our being judged by him all of us were sinners before him and worthy of condemnation theres really no such thing as the agony of dying im quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death you see something happens when the body knows its about to go peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland endorphins they attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain a lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful but ive seen quite a few deaths and with one exception ive never known anyone to undergo anything like agony thats amazing when you think about it i mean how complicated the mechanism is thats being taken apart so we mustnt lower our guard in any sense because of what has happened in terms of the death of osama bin laden and we are certainly not doing that the terror threat level here in the uk remains at severe and were very conscious of the need to continue that death gives meaning to our lives it gives importance and value to time time would become meaningless if there were too much of it if we cant face death well never overcome it you have to look it straight in the eye then you can turn around and walk back out into the light marriage can be viewed as the waiting room for death i can choose to accelerate my disease to an alcoholic death or incurable insanity or i can choose to live within my thoroughly human condition ive always had bronchitis ive been administered the sacrament of death three times for it it is education that will arm us with the tools that will enable us to succeed and put a stop to the rising rates of preventable death most of us harbour a significant amount of subconscious fear about death and act out of this fear in our daily lives war is not the only arena where peace is done to death i am against the death penalty my father was against the death penalty and that was hard in the son of sam summer when fear was driving the desire for the death penalty the need to understand prescription information can literally be a matter of life and death movies like that arent about the visual effects and explosions theyre human stories about family about life about death to awake from death is to die in peace death is feared as birth is forgotten when death has you by the throat you dont mince words should i perchance still feel after my death i would no longer have any doubt but i would most certainly give the lie to anyone asserting before me that i was dead if death is in the room its pretty interesting but i would also say that im interested in getting myself to believe that its going to happen to me im interested in it because if youre not youre nuts its really de facto what were here to find out about a man whose life has been dishonourable is not entitled to escape disgrace in death my father i liked but it was only after his death that i got to know him by writing the play before i pitch any game from spring training to game 7 of the world series im scared to death in seattle i soon found that my radical ideas and aesthetic explorations  ideas and explorations that in richmond virginia might have gotten me stoned to death with hush puppies  were not only accepted but occasionally applauded coming to terms with the fear of death is conducive to healing positive personality transformation and consciousness evolution liberty for wolves is death to the lambs i think one thing that kids who grow up on farms really have going for them is they have exposure to death and birth in a totally different way i think it takes away a little bit of the mystery and a little bit of the fear and i do wish i had that and i wish i was able to grow my own food i now bid farewell to the country of my birth  of my passions  of my death a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies  whose factions i sought to quell  whose intelligence i prompted to a lofty aim  whose freedom has been my fatal dream the death of antigay hate speech is no doubt being hastened by the headspinning speed with which gays as a group  to say nothing of gay marriage  are becoming an unremarkable and even quite traditional parts of american life our birth is nothing but our death begun as tapers waste the moment they take fire virtue alone has majesty in death less base the fear of death than fear of life life is the desert life the solitude death joins us to the great majority i am one who believes that one of the greatest dangers of advertising is not that of misleading people but that of boring them to death people are scared to death of dying i am the opposite people on death row the treatment of animals womens right to choose so much in america is based on religious fundamentalist christianity grow up this is the modern world it is long since i could have adventured on eternity through gods mercy and christs merits but death remained somewhat terrible and that now is taken away and now death is no more to me but to cast myself into my husbands arms and to lie down with him fear not and the god of mercies grant a full gale and a fair entry into his kingdom which may carry sweetly and swiftly over the bar that you find not the rub of death i wish to be a martyr and i dont fear death death has always had a prominent place in my mind there are times when i think somebody might kill me i looked death right in the face we are all of us resigned to death its life we arent resigned to the approach of death certainly concentrates the mind fear of death has never played a large part in my consciousness  perhaps unimaginative of me i might be deceiving myself but i do not think that i do have an inordinate fear of death we see death constantly on film for a culture that has such a problem with death we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way we see people shot killed and blown up and we find it funny and sexy and all those things but the reality of it is that every day people die and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it hamlet is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper all the big unknowable questions like what it is to be a human being the difference between sanity and insanity the meaning of life and death whats real and not real all these subjects can literally drive you mad if we openly declare what is wrong with us what is our deepest need then perhaps the death and despair will by degrees disappear the most dire disaster in love is the death of imagination to be immortal is commonplace except for man all creatures are immortal for they are ignorant of death what is divine terrible incomprehensible is to know that one is immortal life and death have been lacking in my life ultimately life is disease death and oblivion its still better than high school my children are magical creatures and i love them to death but then im one of those guys that is still a bit afraid of the telephone its implications for conversation i still wonder if the jukebox might be the death of live music perhaps we dont need these religious concoctions to pillow the fear of death just the fact that there is an unknown and something greater can bring a feeling of peace thats enough for me if a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club theyd starve to death in almost every interview someone asks what does him stand for i cant even remember our latest lie about that when hanson was hot we said it means hanson is murder the name doesnt have a particular history his infernal majesty was a totally different band i think him derives from some death metal joke early this morning i signed my death warrant i dont think i would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties theres always the inevitable question of whether someone you gave the order to execute might truly have been innocent i hit rock bottom but thank god my bottom wasnt death in an artwork youre always looking for artistic decisions so an ashtray is perfect an ashtray has got life and death since i was a child death is definitely something that i think about every day but i think that everybody does you try and avoid it but its such a big thing that you cant the difference between art about death and actual death is that ones a celebration and the others a dull fact i was taught to confront things you cant avoid death is one of those things to live in a society where youre trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy the fact that flowers dont last for ever makes them beautiful i wouldnt feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy  id be bored to death its not life or death its a game and at the end of the game there is going to be a winner and a loser miller didnt write death of a salesman he released it it was there inside him waiting to be turned loose thats the measure of its merit death is like an arrow that is already in flight and your life lasts only until it reaches you i was never afraid of failure after that because i think coming that close to death you get kissed with the years the actual experience of course fades but the flavor of it doesnt i just had a real sense of what choice do i have but to live fully i think that obviously there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world there is a death wish a perverse death wish not just for ourselves not just for the movie death wish but for the end of all human life when you think about it the end of the world is a little bit like death we all know its going to come eventually and as we get older we feel we see the signs more and more distinctly i try to write lyrics so that they wont age which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence a friend said to me be glad for your troubles  they strengthen you well if thats the truth im going to be so strong theyll have to beat me to death she goes through the vale of death alone each time a babe is born as it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this ordeal so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it emigration is no longer a solution its a defeat people are risking death drowning every day but theyre knocking on doors that are not open in goddess religion death is not feared but is understood to be a part of life followed by birth and renewal deaths an old joke but each individual encounters it anew feminists bore me to death i follow my instinct and if that supports young girls in any way great but id rather they saw it more as a lesson about following their own instincts rather than imitating somebody no real english gentleman in his secret soul was ever sorry for the death of a political economist there are hundreds of frank lloyd wright buildings around the united states and in other countries too wright lived into his 90s and one of his most famous buildings the guggenheim museum in new york was completed just before his death wright buildings look like wright buildings  that is their paradox vets do what doctors used to  diagnose the injury or the condition patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death somehow knowing that alzheimers is coming mocks all ones aspirations  to tell stories to think through certain issues as only a novel can do to be recognised for ones accomplishments and hard work  in a way that old familiar death does not we should weep for men at their birth not at their death you only live twice once when you are born and once when you look death in the face i think when youre 10 years old its too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode kids are better left naive about certain things i love myself anything that has my name im tickled to death sin brought death and death will disappear with the disappearance of sin there is nothing glamorous about death my book trust your heart which is the story of my life will be followed by singing lessons a memoir of love loss hope and healing which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy defeat the fear of death and welcome the death of fear the coward sneaks to death the brave live on only those who spread treachery fire and death out of hatred for the prosperity of others are undeserving of pity if the heart stops for more than two minutes you have massive brain death there are only two minutes between our conscious world and zero thats how fragile our consciousness is the police came to me to say i had death threats and that i had to be careful i believe in the institution of marriage of course being a mormon we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part if you really try hard if you make it work its blissful but i also know a marriage that isnt working can be painful i couldnt have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mothers death the renewed energy the surprising sweetness of grief the tenderness i feel for strangers on walkers the deeper love i have for my siblings and friends the desire to play the mandolin the gift of a visitation you havent lost anything when you know were it is death can hide but not divide i think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty as far as my divorce goes i love my family and i love my wife to death and i just dont know what tomorrows going to bring i have had death threats from people with fixations loss and possession death and life are one there falls no shadow where there shines no sun people who are sick or who have been sick or have come close to death have a lot to say  and they want you to hear it living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life it helps you to live a less trivial life the line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do bulls can do nothing to demand justice they can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a predetermined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death its up to us as a civilized society to call for an end to the running of the bulls and bullfighting my faith isnt very churchy its a pretty personal intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death more than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they werent guilty or fairly tried most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them there is a lot that is wrong why would you be afraid of death it would be an inconvenience i have a lot of undone things and its bound to get in the way but no it doesnt scare me at all we weep over the graves of infants and the little ones taken from us by death but an early grave may be the shortest way to heaven everything that is necessary is also easy you just have to accept it and the most necessary the most natural matter on this planet is death i was ready to quit music it felt to me like music equalled death beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us a manifestation of eternity and a sign of death as well i really wanted to do something positive on the internet i wanted to try to get young people talking about thinking about lifes big questionsmake it cool and ok to wonder about the heart the soul and free will and god and death and big topics like that big human topics i think that the core doctrines of christianity  the incarnation the resurrection life after deaththese are as strong as ever in fact the belief in life after death has increased in this century of all the artists on death row none of them went bankrupt for any culture which is primarily concerned with meaning the study of death  the only certainty that life holds for us  must be central for an understanding of death is the key to liberation in life the study of consciousness that can extend beyond the body is extremely important for the issue of survival since it is this part of human personality that would be likely to survive death the motif of death plays an important role the human psyche in connection with archetypal and karmic material the materialistic paradigm of western science has been a major obstacle for any objective evaluation of the data describing the events occurring at the time of death the knowledge of the realm of death makes it possible for the shaman to move freely back and forth and mediate these journeys for other people the experiences associated with death were seen as visits to important dimensions of reality that deserved to be experienced studied and carefully mapped the elimination of the fear of death transforms the individuals way of being in the world research challenges the materialistic understanding of death according to which biological death represents the final end of existence and of all conscious activity individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives who seem to welcome them to the next world these deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition if consciousness can function independently of the body during ones lifetime it could be able to do the same after death dying before dying has two important consequences it liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise a number of cases have been reported in which a dying individual has a vision of a person about whose death he or she did not know the drink yes ive had tough times in my life especially the last year regarding my exwife my kids i nearly broke my neck i was on death row with pneumonia though i am a catholic a professing one i have serious doubts about the survival of the human personality after death im death obsessed you know i have death all over my house i have a stuffed two headed sheep since fame is an illusion and death is in our future all we have is the next moment before we are swallowed into oblivion of course we avoid death to know something is inevitable is one thing to accept to truly feel it thats different we all labor against our own cure for death is the cure of all diseases life itself is but the shadow of death and souls departed but the shadows of the living what is ironic is that allen ginsbergs importance was in its twilight for so many years that it took his death to bring it to the front page he electrified an entire world when i see someone who is starved they dont look alert they dont have boundless energy if youre too skinny it looks like youre near death american horror goes for a very specific kind of seventies suburban downer ambience  flowers in the attic paperbacks black sabbath album covers and latenight flicks like lets scare jessica to death it even has go ask aliceera urban legends people want the right to die at a time of their own choosing too many families have watched helplessly as a relative dies slowly longing for death when i die dont let my death stop the resistance its a matter of life and death for this country the kenyan forests are facing extinction and it is a manmade problem its something i want to overcome and my kids are scared to death to fly i want them to witness me overcome it death by starvation is slow libertarians know that a free country has nothing to fear from anyone coming in or going out  while a welfare state is scared to death of poor people coming in and rich people getting out women have not yet realized the cowardice that resides for if they should decide to do so they would be able to fight you until death and to prove that i speak the truth amongst so many women i will be the first to act setting an example for them to follow sickness insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my cradle and they have followed me throughout my life there are people who never experience that who remain closed until death from fear of change one of the big questions in the climate change debate are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot if you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat it wont jump out instead it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death we humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing in this situation i was constantly exposed to danger and death we were then in a dangerous helpless situation exposed daily to perils and death amongst savages and wild beasts not a white man in the country but ourselves i had always loved john fords pictures and i came to love him too but i was frightened to death working for him he used the shock treatment while directing me hitchcock had to fight to the death to make his movies after my mothers death i had such difficulty relating to people the supreme court of the united states has validated the nazi method of execution in concentration camps starving them to death i will admit like socrates and aristotle and plato and some other philosophers that there are instances where the death penalty would seem appropriate not one has shown an iota of fear of death they want to end this agony if christ can die in a barn i think the death of a human in a van is not so bad youve gotta know what death is to know life i hate to say this but ill repeat it after death all we know that you do is stink theres stuff i dont like to rehearse really emotional things i dont like to rehearse you just beat it to death im trying to knock the medical profession into accepting its responsibilities and those responsibilities include assisting their patients with death nobody with an iq higher than emergencyroom temperature could ever believe that death panels would be appointed to nudge the elderly toward euthanasia yet for idle entertainment its hard to beat sarah palins ignorant nattering on the subject the miser starving his brothers body starves also his own soul and at death shall creep out of his great estate of injustice poor and naked and miserable im not supposed to be able to speak clearly and decipher whats going on in the media im supposed to be the typical amateur whos 22 and scared to death and cant believe he won the olympics i stay way from that area and theres only so many songs you can write about love sex and death my death will be caused by morphine which i have deliberately taken with suicidal intent a shakespearean tragedy as so far considered may be called a story of exceptional calamity leading to the death of a man in high estate but it is clearly much more than this and we have now to regard it from another side the american people are not just being taxed to death theyre being taxed after death but no one should have to sell the lifes work of a parent or a loved one just to pay the federal government we worry about the seemingly everincreasing number of natural catastrophes yet this is mainly a consequence of cnn  we see many more but the number is roughly constant and we manage to deal much better with them over time globally the death rate from catastrophes has dropped about fiftyfold over the past century i am politically prochoice but personally prolife i have my faith but refuse to force it on the world at large  especially this world so brutal and unjust i cannot make these wrenching personal life and death decisions for others  nor do i believe they should be made by a church run by childless men and in a funny way each death is different and you mourn each death differently and each death brings back the death you mourned earlier and you get into a bit of a pileup we burned to death 100000 japanese civilians in tokyo  men women and children lemay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost but what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win its normally the kiss of death to be identified as a rising star or someone to watch i was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death you can go online and type chokeholds and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out you can hear what noises they make when they go unconscious see how their bodies flop and everything youtube is amazing for the more detailed stuff over the past 50 years we got versions of xray specs and space vacations and even death rays but the xray specs dont fit on your face  theyre big things that screen your luggage for guns space vacations are real but they cost 20 million we have death rays but you have to be a triple phd to play with them life is like a very short visit to a toyshop between birth and death they can rule the world while they can persuade us our pain belongs in some order is death by famine worse than death by suicide than a life of famine and suicide until the day of his death no man can be sure of his courage he who is obsessed by death is made guilty by it there is no such thing as an ugly language today i hear every language as if it were the only one and when i hear of one that is dying it overwhelms me as though it were the death of the earth the first novel i wrote was a monster  clocking in at 180000 words  but it died a death a death it deserved it was called the gods first make mad it was a good title but it was the only good thing about the book i didnt let that put me off i have sometimes imagined my own death and brought myself to tears any existence deprived of freedom is a kind of death but for me it is when a student has died i find the death of a young person the most difficult and painful of times to explain it to other young people to see a bright future snuffed out is just awful i am haunted by those deaths nothing is absolute with the debatable exceptions of this statement and death im watching the weather channel more than ive ever watched it im scared to death its going to rain nature creates while destroying and doesnt care whether it creates or destroys as long as life isnt extinguished as long as death doesnt lose its rights if you have fun fine its not all life and death when the courts decide that murderers rapists and others who maliciously break our social contract deserve health care that most working americans cant afford they are condemning good people to death people need jobs people need happy and successful lives there should be marriage between one man and one woman there should the value of person from conception until natural death it comes with faith for with complete faith there is no fear of what faces you in life or death i think life is sacred whether its abortion or the death penalty i am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend dudley moore instead of joyfully looking forward to my birth my mother began systematically preparing for her own death she was fatalistic cause at the end of the day honestly at the end of the day when youre in your death bed and thats it i think its the relationships youve had and the people that youve touched and the people that have touched you that matter as a comic you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death ive accentuated the look over the years as a comic you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death the writer crafts their ideal world in my world everyone has really long conversations or just picks apart pop culture to death and everyone talks in monologue our law is a jordanian law that we inherited which applies to both the west bank and gaza and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to israelis if i ever completely lost my nervousness i would be frightened half to death i think i might actually die of showing off itll be on my headstone  cause of death showing off when we have done our best we can as a united people take whatever may befall with calm courage and confidence that this old nation will survive and if death should come to many of us death is not the end i think to have the skill set and the ability to physically help others in matters of life and death must be incredibly empowering i dont think of death in a romantic way anymore to have been torn from the study would have been as death my time was entirely occupied with art when i was younger i wasnt concentrating on good days i was managing a career and trying to have a good year it would always lead to something which never leads to anything except death where everything leads to and then as i got older and then i had my kids and everything i began to appreciate a great wednesday if you wish to make a man look noble your best course is to kill him what superiority he may have inherited from his race what superiority nature may have personally gifted him with comes out in death death is the ugly fact which nature has to hide and she hides it well i like death im a big fan of it its certain that the death of an actor can be on a television screen playing the same thing every week in these dangerous times where it seems the world is ripping apart at the seams we can all learn how to survive from those who stare death squarely in the face every day and we should reach out to each other and bond as a community rather than hide from the terrors of life at the end of the millennium between our birth and death we may touch understanding as a moth brushes a window with its wing washington not jefferson freed his slaves upon his death there are some people who walk into a room and they oxygenate it by their very being theres fresh air then there are those who come in with the smell of death and they suck the life out when we play angel of death its actually a 2 and half minutes sing til our party starts that song is pretty much been played traditionally in the end patrick henry did not say give me absolutely safety or give me death america is supposed to be about freedom lots of people there seemed to be in denial in absolute denial of death  everybodys pretending that death doesnt happen in la if you do enough exercise and take enough wheatgrass and have your pill every day you might not die on the basis of biological sociological and historical knowledge we should recognize that the individual self is subject to death or decay but the sum total of individual achievement for better or worse lives on in the immortality of the larger i just dont get death at all yes its there but i dont get it i cant let my mothers death have been in vain democracy is the best revenge and we will have it you should celebrate the end of a love affair as they celebrate death in new orleans with songs laughter dancing and a lot of wine nothing is a matter of life and death except life and death he killed his enemies because he was afraid they would kill him amin ordered entire tribes to be put to death because he feared they would rebel to be clear climate change is a true 800 pound gorilla in the room the effects of global warming threaten global environmental upheaval over the coming century but for south florida and the everglades it could be our death knell if urgent action is not taken its funny though speaking of fathers and sons because me and john goodman played father and son like five or six years ago in the film death sentence and i got back with him again in inside llewyn davis you know ive never actually really believed that death is inevitable i just think its a rumor i rely on guns for protection in life god does not say this is lala land god doesnt say welcome to earth everythings perfect theres no crime theres no murder theres no death the world is imperfect and you have to be on guard i dont want to hear about my death the situation in the united states is becoming more dire for average ordinary americans and the last thing we need to do is to spend money on death destruction and war death doesnt frighten me now i can think peacefully of ending a long life defeat the fear of death and you welcome the death of fear the illness and the untimely death of my brothers has made me conscious of the fact that  rather than just think about it  its crucial that you do today what you want to do the cult of the individual is killing us i think twitter signals the death of western civilisation but people have been saying that since demosthenes you realize that however much you dont think about death  or think thats for other people  youre just an organism living from day to day im just grateful im here i think about death a lot i really do because i cant believe i wont exist its the ego isnt it i feel that i should retreat into a better form of zen buddhism than this kind of egodominated thing but i dont know i mean i want to come back as a tree but i suspect that its just not going to happen is it the die is set and malcolm will not escape for the foolish talk he spoke against his benefactor such a man is worthy of death and it would have been so were it not for muhammads confidence that god would give him the victory over the enemies if the human condition were the periodic table maybe love would be hydrogen at no 1 death would be helium at no 2 power i reckon would be where oxygen is any film which views the darker side of life which is death with a sense of humor is very much to my taste my death taking the light from my eyes gives back to the day the purity which they soiled heres a thing about the death of your mother or anyone else you love you cant anticipate how youll feel afterward people will tell you a few may be close to right none exactly right it is not death but dying which is terrible i believe the death of bobby kennedy was in many ways the death of decency in america i think it was the death of manners and formality the death of poetry and the death of a dream when i was on a major label i felt obliged to say yes to every interview tour and whatever else the label is always telling you this aint going to last so i worked myself half to death i learnt from that and i like to pace myself now most of the debate over the cultures of death and life is about process the debate focuses on the technology available to determine how we prolong life and how and when we end it if you think aficionados of a living constitution want to bring you flexibility think again you think the death penalty is a good idea persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it you want a right to abortion persuade your fellow citizens and enact it thats flexibility death is a very important part of life not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia there may be legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not with regard to abortion and euthanasia depakote also has a really bad side effect which is death i think that much of this was running in background as i contemplated whether or not to attend the ps 99 reunion although i certainly anticipated that i would not it smelled like death not youth as a reward for their efforts however those early christians were beaten stoned to death thrown to the lions tortured and crucified every conceivable method was used to stop them from talking the death penalty is being applied in the united states as a fatal lottery i was in two episodes playing christopher reeves characters emissary they wanted to have my character announce dr swans death which i thought was exploitative planning to play thats what saving for retirement is today  and it is antithetical to the nature of play fully within the definition of work and blissfully ignorant of the reality of death im not on the run from anything and im not at all clear about what im running towards but as some great writer put it i want to be certain that when i arrive at death im totally exhausted so here is one of my theories on happiness we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end this view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of philip gould philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics when he died i felt like i had lost a limb what we think of as our sensitivity is only the higher evolution of terror in a poor dumb beast we suffer for nothing our own death wish is our only real tragedy i start thinking about life after death ive got to quit thinking about it because its very deep very deep sometimes you start thinking about it and you dont feel like you want to be alive so i dont like to get all quiet when we are dealing with death we are constantly being dragged down by the event humor diverts our attention and lifts our sagging spirits ill never stop dreaming that one day we can be a real family together all of us laughing and talking loving and understanding not looking at the past but only to the future if a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds i strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference they are the father the mother and the teacher family means no one gets left behind or forgotten the love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege sister is probably the most competitive relationship within the family but once the sisters are grown it becomes the strongest relationship family is not an important thing its everything family is the most important thing in the world a family can develop only with a loving woman as its center a happy family is but an earlier heaven a woman can take care of the family it takes a man to provide structure to provide stability a man should never neglect his family for business if you cannot get rid of the family skeleton you may as well make it dance the greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intendedand not to take a hint when a hint isnt intended he who is overly attached to his family members experiences fear and sorrow for the root of all grief is attachment thus one should discard attachment to be happy insanity runs in my family it practically gallops you dont choose your family they are gods gift to you as you are to them america cannot continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home people are pretty forgiving when it comes to other peoples families the only family that ever horrifies you is your own my family comes first maybe thats what makes me different from other guys if god can work through me he can work through anyone cherish your human connections  your relationships with friends and family spend some time this weekend on home improvement improve your attitude toward your family i come from that society and there is a common thread specifically family values  the idea that you do anything for your family and the unconditional love for ones children without a family man alone in the world trembles with the cold all of us grow up in particular realities  a home family a clan a small town a neighborhood depending upon how were brought up we are either deeply aware of the particular reading of reality into which we are born or we are peripherally aware of it dad kept us out of school but school comes and goes family is forever to us family means putting your arms around each other and being there the family is one of natures masterpieces my family is my strength and my weakness i was born into the most remarkable and eccentric family i could possibly have hoped for rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof i woke up one morning thinking about wolves and realized that wolf packs function as families everyone has a role and if you act within the parameters of your role the whole pack succeeds and when that falls apart so does the pack a family is a place where principles are hammered and honed on the anvil of everyday living the only rock i know that stays steady the only institution i know that works is the family maybe there is no actual place called hell maybe hell is just having to listen to our grandparents breathe through their noses when theyre eating sandwiches if one is desperate for love i suggest looking at ones friends and family and see if love is all around if not get a new set of friends a new family the children have been a wonderful gift to me and im thankful to have once again seen our world through their eyes they restore my faith in the familys future when trouble comes its your family that supports you give a little love to a child and you get a great deal back little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between love and duty i think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life first and foremost comes my family and my life with brad we have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that ones family is the most important thing in life i look at it this way one of these days ill be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me and the only people wholl be with me will be my family dignity is not negotiable dignity is the honor of the family my father used to play with my brother and me in the yard mother would come out and say youre tearing up the grass were not raising grass dad would reply were raising boys the family is the first essential cell of human society one of the things that binds us as a family is a shared sense of humor the family is the test of freedom because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself for me nothing has ever taken precedence over being a mother and having a family and a home when you have a godly husband a godly wife children who respect their parents and who are loved by their parents who provide for those children their physical and spiritual and material needs lovingly you have the ideal unit both within the family and without our sisters hold up our mirrors our images of who we are and of who we can dare to be in every conceivable manner the family is link to our past bridge to our future the family you come from isnt as important as the family youre going to have what must it be like for a little boy to read that daddy never loved mummy its very strange that most people dont care if their knowledge of their family history only goes back three generations ive given it my all ive done my best now im ready with my family to begin the next phase of our lives i am the baby in the family and i always will be i am actually very happy to have that position but i still get teased i dont mind that as a general thing when a woman wears the pants in a family she has a good right to them the family is the nucleus of civilization ive always put my family first and thats just the way it is i dont think anyone has a normal family i never did quite fit the glamour mode it is life with my husband and family that is my high now theres nothing i value more than the closeness of friends and family a smile as i pass someone on the street my kids give me the balance to live right there is no such thing as fun for the whole family tennis just a game family is forever i have frequently been questioned especially by women of how i could reconcile family life with a scientific career well it has not been easy i believe the world is one big family and we need to help each other when i was younger my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches my dad loves being around all kinds of animals hes the one who got me to be a really big animal lover i grew up in a big family with a lot of kids around and i definitely want to have children as well my life comes down to three moments the death of my father meeting my husband and the birth of my daughter everything i did previous to that just doesnt seem to add up to very much the attempt to redefine the family as a purely voluntary arrangement grows out of the modern delusion that people can keep all their options open all the time it is extraordinary that when you are acquainted with a whole family you can forget about them it takes a lot of work to put together a marriage to put together a family and a home family life itself that safest most traditional most approved of female choices is not a sanctuary it is perpetually a dangerous place a family is a risky venture because the greater the love the greater the loss thats the tradeoff but ill take it all you leave home to seek your fortune and when you get it you go home and share it with your family i mean i look at my dad he was twenty when he started having a family and he was always the coolest dad he did everything for his kids and he never made us feel like he was pressured i know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that i find the family the most mysterious and fascinating institution in the world pray in your family daily that yours may be in the number of the families who call upon god if we abandon marriage we abandon the family i am tortured when i am away from my family from my children i am horribly guiltridden the left dismisses talk about the collapse of family life and talks instead about the emergence of the growing new diversity of family types womens natural role is to be a pillar of the family some of the most important conversations ive ever had occurred at my familys dinner table its not that our family has no taste its just that our familys taste is inconsistent a woman should be home with the children building that home and making sure theres a secure family atmosphere i consider my mom and all my sisters my friends a woman can plan when to have her family and how to support a family im not much of a family man im just not that into it i love kids i adore them but i dont want to live my life for them my family is more important than my party i am the family face flesh perishes i live on i stay in tune with my family and god when im ready i plan to adopt i still believe in family i would rather start a family than finish one you have to defend your honor and your family happy is said to be the family which can eat onions together they are for the time being separate from the world and have a harmony of aspiration i have a family to support and im not always going to be doing exactly what i want to do parents need all the help they can get the strongest as well as the most fragile family requires a vital network of social supports when you start about family about lineage and ancestry you are talking about every person on earth i would love a family im at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger but who knows i have a lot of very close girlfriends and sisters  im from an all female family my father often quips that even the cat was neutered at a certain point im going to want to have a family i love my family for all of those willing to help me start a family i am flattered i will let you know when i need your help i realized my family was funny because nobody ever wanted to leave our house the one thing that kept our family together was the music the only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music my family was my guide to my reality well sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids but obviously we want a family so well have to start thinking about that i love children and i get along with them great its just that i believe if youre going to be a parent there has to be something inside you that says i want a family i dont feel that sense of urgency i love cooking for myself and cooking for my family also my mom and family are very important to me and i know that this is not expected i live quietly at home among my family and friends i dont know if i believe in marriage i believe in family love and children make a goal box a chart of positive daily contact with a family when you are working with them the most difficult is the first family to bring someone out of the world when i remember my family i always remember their backs they were always indignantly leaving places if i had no family my wife and i would lead a much more romantic and nomadic existence family nature and health all go together there are things that you cannot talk to your mother and father about there are things that you cannot talk to your children about once i got married and had kids i moved away from romantic roles because it seemed wrong to have my 3yearold wondering why daddy was kissing someone else i grew up in a very religious family i could read the quran easily at the age of five the foundation of family  thats where it all begins for me i grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed and debated intensely i have these visions of myself being thirty thirtyfive forty having a family my family background was deeply christian like all my family and class i considered it a sign of weakness to show affection to have been caught kissing my mother would have been a disgrace and to have shown affection for my father would have been a disaster the joke in our family is that we can cry reading the phone book we went to church every sunday when i was a kid the only time i sang was around my family our family life was certainly not intellectual we love to be with our family and friends and i can tell you that lots of eating will be involved my whole damn family was nice i dont think ive imagined it its true maybe it has to do with being brought up as christian scientists half of my relatives were readers or practitioners in the church god did not intend the human family to be wafted to heaven on flowery beds of ease to enjoy good health to bring true happiness to ones family to bring peace to all one must first discipline and control ones own mind if a man can control his mind he can find the way to enlightenment and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him as a child my familys menu consisted of two choices take it or leave it learn to enjoy every minute of your life be happy now dont wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future think how really precious is the time you have to spend whether its at work or with your family every minute should be enjoyed and savored in dwelling live close to the ground in thinking keep to the simple in conflict be fair and generous in governing dont try to control in work do what you enjoy in family life be completely present the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city its all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family every child should have a caring adult in their lives and thats not always a biological parent or family member it may be a friend or neighbor often times it is a teacher as the family goes so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated mistakes are tolerated communication is open and rules are flexible  the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family my family frankly they werent folks who went to church every week my mother was one of the most spiritual people i knew but she didnt raise me in the church so i came to my christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of jesus christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that i would want to lead it was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today the 40hour work week the minimum wage family leave health insurance social security medicare retirement plans the cornerstones of the middleclass security all bear the union label the great danger for family life in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure comfort and independence lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish fathers should be neither seen nor heard that is the only proper basis for family life actors are one family over the entire world he that raises a large family does indeed while he lives to observe them stand a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too any problem big or small within a family always seems to start with bad communication someone isnt listening when his life was ruined his family killed his farm destroyed job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens why god why me and the thundering voice of god answered theres just something about you that pisses me off never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people  your family friends and coworkers and even strangers you meet along the way the other night i ate at a real nice family restaurant every table had an argument going i can make a firm pledge under my plan no family making less than 250000 a year will see any form of tax increase not your income tax not your payroll tax not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes all men are children and of one family the same tale sends them all to bed and wakes them in the morning no matter what youve done for yourself or for humanity if you cant look back on having given love and attention to your own family what have you really accomplished its true christmas can feel like a lot of work particularly for mothers but when you look back on all the christmases in your life youll find youve created family traditions and lasting memories those memories good and bad are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success it enables you to ignore the minor hurts the opponents pressure and the temporary failures the details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private and i had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family so much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty all other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it i would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life a man who had good friends fine family  and i dont think i could ask for anything more than that actually positive feelings come from being honest about yourself and accepting your personality and physical characteristics warts and all and from belonging to a family that accepts you without question to maintain a joyful family requires much from both the parents and the children each member of the family has to become in a special way the servant of the others perhaps the greatest social service that can be rendered by anybody to the country and to mankind is to bring up a family my friends and family are my support system they tell me what i need to hear not what i want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times without them i have no idea where i would be and i know that their love for me is whats keeping my head above the water the firstborn in every family is always dreaming for an imaginary older brother or sister who will look out for them all the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers if every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family  and gods love  this world would be a far more gentle and better place but let me perfectly clear because i know youll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people if your family earns less than 250000 a year you will not see your taxes increased a single dime i repeat not one single dime if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands if i win and get the money then the oakland police department is going to buy a boys home me a house my family a house and a stop police brutality center on thanksgiving i will stop to give thanks that my family is safe and healthy especially because i realize that following the tragedies of this year it is all too real a possibility that they might not have been blood relatives often have nothing to do with family and similarly family is about who you choose to make your life with i am confident that nobody will accuse me of selfishness if i ask to spend time while i am still in good health with my family my friends and also with myself i looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it all happy families resemble one another each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way with all my fans i got a family again my restaurants are never opened on thanksgiving i want my staff to spend time with their family if they can my feeling is if i cant figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays then i dont deserve to be an owner the most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it i come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage in the richest country in the history of the world this obama economy has crushed the middle class family income has fallen by 4000 but health insurance premiums are higher food prices are higher utility bills are higher and gasoline prices have doubled today more americans wake up in poverty than ever before family is conflict and its something that we all relate to so live that you wouldnt be ashamed to sell the family parrot to the town gossip smartness runs in my family when i went to school i was so smart my teacher was in my class for five years we believed in our idea  a family park where parents and children could have fun together like religion politics and family planning cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public its too controversial friendship is held to be the severest test of character it is easy we think to be loyal to a family and clan whose blood is in your own veins marriage is an act of will that signifies and involves a mutual gift which unites the spouses and binds them to their eventual souls with whom they make up a sole family  a domestic church i have muslim members of my family i have lived in muslim countries i looked up my family tree and found out i was the sap as a single withered tree if set aflame causes a whole forest to burn so does a rascal son destroy a whole family i love my family very much i wish i could see them a little more often than i do but we understand because were a show business family and we all work this is all the inheritance i give to my dear family the religion of christ will give them one which will make them rich indeed my biggest hobby is hanging out with my family and kids i was angry and frustrated until i started my own family and my first child was born until then i didnt really appreciate life the way i should have but fortunately i woke up the most important thing in the world is family and love my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion her intelligence reflected in my daughters a man ought to live so that everybody knows he is a christian and most of all his family ought to know if you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account the american culture promotes personal responsibility the dignity of work the value of education the merit of service devotion to a purpose greater than self and at the foundation the preeminence of family now is the moment when we can stand up and say im an american i make my destiny and we deserve better my children deserve better my family deserves better my country deserves better so here we stand americans have a choice my dad had been born in mexico and his family had to leave during the mexican revolution the promise of america has always been that if you worked hard had the right values took some risks that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation president obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet my promise is to help you and your family when someone has cancer the whole family and everyone who loves them does too i love my family and i miss them very much but im a new person now i know a lot of people will not agree with what ive done but it was right for me i have now disposed of all my property to my family there is one thing more i wish i could give them and that is the christian religion knowledge is power information is liberating education is the premise of progress in every society in every family nobody has ever before asked the nuclear family to live all by itself in a box the way we do with no relatives no support weve put it in an impossible situation you cannot have maternal health without reproductive health and reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal safe abortion family quarrels are bitter things they dont go according to any rules theyre not like aches or wounds theyre more like splits in the skin that wont heal because theres not enough material all the men in my family were bearded and most of the women im just glad i was able to return to some of that innocence and beauty i had as a child when i started my own family and my children brought me back some of that spirit be strong believe in freedom and in god love yourself understand your sexuality have a sense of humor masturbate dont judge people by their religion color or sexual habits love life and your family if you ever start feeling like you have the goofiest craziest most dysfunctional family in the world all you have to do is go to a state fair because five minutes at the fair youll be going you know were alright we are dang near royalty the place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one particularly if he plays golf a family with the wrong members in control that perhaps is as near as one can come to describing england in a phrase cherish your human connections your relationships with friends and family all in the family was intellectual it was art where would you be without friends the people to pick you up when you need lifting we come from homes far from perfect so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends  your own chosen family theres nothing like a really loyal dependable good friend nothing i think every girl needs to love herself regardless of anything like if youre having a bad day if you dont like your hair if you dont have the best family situation whatever you have to love yourself and you cant do anything until you love yourself first in my family we were americans we were republicans and we were methodists no one really wants to admit they are lonely and it is never really addressed very much between friends and family but i have felt lonely many times in my life i think every chef not just in america but across the world has a doubleedged sword  two jackets one thats driven a selfconfessed perfectionist thoroughbred hate incompetence and switch off the stove take off the jacket and become a family man basketball is my passion i love it but my family and friends mean everything to me thats whats important i need my phone so i can keep in contact with them at all times happy or unhappy families are all mysterious we have only to imagine how differently we would be described  and will be after our deaths  by each of the family members who believe they know us i believe with all my heart that america remains the great idea that inspires the world it is a privilege to be born here it is an honor to become a citizen here it is a gift to raise your family here to vote here and to live here no amount of law enforcement can solve a problem that goes back to the family family love is messy clinging and of an annoying and repetitive pattern like bad wallpaper the seven deadly sins want of money bad health bad temper chastity family ties knowing that you know things and believing in the christian religion nixon was the most dishonest individual i have ever met in my life he lied to his wife his family his friends his colleagues in the congress lifetime members of his own political party the american people and the world apparently one in five people in the world are chinese and there are five people in my family so it must be one of them its either my mum or my dad or my older brother colin or my younger brother hochanchu but i think its colin if you have autism in the family history you still vaccinate delay it a bit space them out i am blessed to have so many great things in my life  family friends and god all will be in my thoughts daily at best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love but it is also all too often where we learn nasty things like hate rage and shame i say if everybody in this house lives where its god first friends and family second and you third we wont ever have an argument but the problem is that when i go around and speak on campuses i still dont get young men standing up and saying how can i combine career and family my father was brought up in an orphanage in the catskills he was a factory worker and because his family wasnt there for him family was everything we could disagree inside the house but outside the house it was us against the world so when i became a drag actor he looked sideways but said okay my family and i would never receive royalties on the revenue that my materials brought into the church materials that were created on our own personal time a good job is more than just a paycheck a good job fosters independence and discipline and contributes to the health of the community a good job is a means to provide for the health and welfare of your family to own a home and save for retirement my work and my family are very important to me i refuse to feel guilty i feel guilty about too much in my life but not about money i went through periods when i had nothing so somebody in my family has to get stinkin wealthy everything i have my career my success my family i owe to america probably the worst time in a persons life is when they have to kill a family member because they are the devil but otherwise its been a pretty good day if you have learned how to disagree without being disagreeable then you have discovered the secrete of getting along  whether it be business family relations or life itself my wife and i both come from irish families there are two kinds of irish families the hitting kind and the kidding kind if youre fortunate  and both of us are  you come from the kidding kind of irish family my family kinda hit the skids we were experiencing poverty at that point we all got a job where the whole family had to work as security guards and janitors and i just got angry the practice of patience toward one another the overlooking of one anothers defects and the bearing of one anothers burdens is the most elementary condition of all human and social activity in the family in the professions and in society its hard knowing who to trust with your personal life when you cry in your room at night you dont always know who to call so i am very close to my family the most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers the original meal has never been found think about what people are doing on facebook today theyre keeping up with their friends and family but theyre also building an image and identity for themselves which in a sense is their brand theyre connecting with the audience that they want to connect to its almost a disadvantage if youre not on it now italians come to ruin most generally in three ways women gambling and farming my family chose the slowest one i had this child and it destroyed my family people should watch out for three things avoid a major addiction dont get so deeply into debt that it controls your life and dont start a family before youre ready to settle down i was told to avoid the business all together because of the rejection people would say to me dont you want to have a normal job and a normal family i guess that would be good advice for some people but i wanted to act there is little less trouble in governing a private family than a whole kingdom there is not much less vexation in the government of a private family than in the managing of an entire state the god who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated i do have a close circle of friends and i am very fortunate to have them as friends i feel very close to them i think friends are everything in life after your family you come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise whats the point in life the baby boomers are getting older and will stay older for longer and they will run right into the dementia firing range how will a society cope especially a society that cant so readily rely on those stable family relationships that traditionally provided the backbone of care universal peace sounds ridiculous to the head of an average family the hispanic community understands the american dream and have not forgotten what they were promised  that in the us a free market system allows us all to succeed economically achieve stability and security for your family and leave your children better off than yourselves clearly older women and especially older women who have led an active life or elder women who successfully maneuver through their own family life have so much to teach us about sharing patience and wisdom ive been so fortunate in my life that my family has never been jealous of my success they have shown true love and commitment to me by being supportive they shared in it sure i have friends plenty of friends and they all come around wantin to borrow money ive always been generous with my friends and family with money but selfish with the important stuff like love there are no adequate substitutes for father mother and children bound together in a loving commitment to nurture and protect no government no matter how wellintentioned can take the place of the family in the scheme of things christmas can have a real melancholy aspect cause it packages itself as this idea of perfect family cohesion and love and youre always going to come up short when you measure your personal life against the idealized personal lives that are constantly thrust in our faces primarily by tv commercials as women slowly gain power their values and priorities are reshaping the agenda a multitude of studies show that when women control the family funds they generally spend more on health nutrition and education  and less on alcohol and cigarettes as you age naturally your family shows more and more on your face if you deny that you deny your heritage the virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within ones own family the moment someone chooses to trust in jesus christ his sins are wiped away and he is adopted into gods family that individual is set apart as a child of god with a sacred purpose leftwing politicians take away your liberty in the name of children and of fighting poverty while rightwing politicians do it in the name of family values and fighting drugs either way government gets bigger and you become less free the only sensible ends of literature are first the pleasurable toil of writing second the gratification of ones family and friends and lastly the solid cash i dont have to look up my family tree because i know that im the sap we give a lot of others significance in our lives even when they dont deserve it it doesnt matter if theyre family or if youve known them forever if theyre not good for you theyve got to go if you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and dont think anything of personalities or emotional conflicts or of money or of family distractions it is amazing how quickly you get through those 5000 steps if you have issues with family friends and people at work try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want in that i found being able to talk to my family about my feelings praying for strength and realizing that our lives have a deep purpose and the journey of our lives is to find out what that is and express it was the only way i could have gotten through it everything happens for a reason im used to it i prepare for it like i say at the end of the day those in charge of their own destiny are going to do whats right for them and their family a family is a unit composed not only of children but of men women an occasional animal and the common cold we are special because weve been united not by a common race or ethnicity were bound together by common values that family is the most important institution in society that almighty god is the source of all we have you all know that i have been sustained throughout my life by three saving graces  my family my friends and a faith in the power of resilience and hope these graces have carried me through difficult times and they have brought more joy to the good times than i ever could have imagined i think illness is a family journey no matter what the outcome everybody has to be allowed to process it and mourn and deal with it in their own way gods dream is that you and i and all of us will realize that we are family that we are made for togetherness for goodness and for compassion your ability to communicate is an important tool in your pursuit of your goals whether it is with your family your coworkers or your clients and customers one of the greatest things drama can do at its best is to redefine the words we use every day such as love home family loyalty and envy tragedy need not be a downer my childhood was safe and sane no abuse and no traumas i was surrounded by a large and loving family who taught me the importance of hard work and a meaningful education i think that in a year i may retire i cannot take my money with me when i die and i wish to enjoy it with my family while i live i should prefer living in germany to any other country though i am an american and am loyal to my country in the investigation of a neurotic style of life we must always suspect an opponent and note who suffers most because of the patients condition usually this is a member of the family getting married and starting a family has been a lifelong goal and one that i have persevered through different paths up to it i cannot remember a moment in my life when i have not felt the love of my family we were a family that would have killed for each other  and we still are a man filled with the love of god is not content with blessing his family alone but ranges through the whole world anxious to bless the whole human race and i keep saying whether you like the president or not everybody has to pull together and help the president because as the president goes so goes the country as the country goes so goes your job your ability to feed your family your government rather like batman i embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong good and bad and justice life goes by really fast and it seems that there are times when youre burying a lot of friends and family and then there are times that feel really precious and everybody is doing okay this is one of those times the first pages of memory are like the old family bible the first leaves are wholly faded and somewhat soiled with handling but when we turn further and come to the chapters where adam and eve were banished from paradise then all begins to grow clear and legible i would prefer to have no money but to have a nice family and good friends around ive never had a divorce but ive seen so many of my friends my sister my family go through that stuff so i try to write for the people that cant write about it i take on their sorrow so im able to kind of express it or their joy a real hangover is nothing to try out family remedies on the only cure for a real hangover is death im surrounded by great friends and family i dont know what i would do without them love and fear everything the father of a family says must inspire one or the other in gods family there are no outsiders no enemies family life is too intimate to be preserved by the spirit of justice it can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice holidays are the best i couldnt imagine being from a small family everything family does is reflection on the other people my mother has always been the social glue holding the family together i always put clothes and family photos under the mattress in case the house burns down i know some people say its not the best to work with your family but i have never understood that because its always worked so well for me since im always working my best holiday memories are definitely when i can just go home and spend time with my family i talked about my family my familys so important people think i have courage the courage in my family are my wife pam my three daughters here nicole jamie leeann my mom whos right here too when were dealing with the people in our family  no matter how annoying or gross they may be no matter how selfinflicted their suffering may appear no matter how afflicted they are with ignorance prejudice or nose hairs  we give from the deepest parts of ourselves the breakdown of the black community in order to maintain slavery began with the breakdown of the black family men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldnt have that kind of love it might get in the way of the economics of slavery your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river we will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve samesex marriage and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle you go through life wondering what is it all about but at the end of the day its all about family the police cannot protect the citizen at this stage of our development and they cannot even protect themselves in many cases it is up to the private citizen to protect himself and his family and this is not only acceptable but mandatory it is the logic of consumerism that undermines the values of loyalty and permanence and promotes a different set of values that is destructive of family life leave the matter of religion to the family altar the church and the private school supported entirely by private contributions keep the church and state forever separate ive made all my money on my own without my family and i work very hard i guess you could say i devoted myself so strongly to my music that for awhile i forgot about my family but i only get one set of parents and i think i forgot about that for a little while when families are strong and stable so are children  showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes but when things go wrong  either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship  the impact on a childs later life can be devastating in the past 40 years the united states lost more than a million farmers and ranchers many of our farmers are aging today only nine percent of family farm income comes from farming and more and more of our farmers are looking elsewhere for their primary source of income see thats why baracks running to end the war in iraq responsibly  to build an economy that lifts every family to make sure health care is available for every american  and to make sure that every child in this nation has a worldclass education all the way from preschool to college it all starts with the script its not worth taking myself away from my family if i dont have something im really passionate about historically the family has played the primary role in educating children for life with the school providing supplemental scaffolding to the family i did commit to myself that i would not jump back into being the workaholic that i can be before i gave myself an honest opportunity to create the marriage of my dreams and to create the beginning of the family of my dreams and that took a hot second you know my family and friends have never been yesmen yes youre doing the right thing youre always right no they tell me when im wrong and thats why ive been able to stay who i am and stay humble children in a family are like flowers in a bouquet theres always one determined to face in an opposite direction from the way the arranger desires the cia is made up of boys whose families sent them to princeton but wouldnt let them into the family brokerage business theres a schizoid streak within the family anyway so i dare say that im affected by that the majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution as for my brother he doesnt want to leave he likes it very much let your family staff and friends know that youre still the same person despite all the publicity and notoriety that accompanies your position i come from a family of very devout praying people that idea of peace and love toward humanity shouldnt be nationalistic or denominational it should be a chief concern for all mankind what people dont understand is joining a gang aint bad its cool its fine when you in the hood joining a gang its cool because all your friends are in the gang all your familys in the gang were not just killing people every night were just hanging out having a good time i am not generous about telling people who i am and what i like to do because its my life and it only belongs to me and my friends and family love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a mans starving i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist  although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me i am healthy my family is healthy that is the important thing after that we go racing i realised how paranoid and guarded and not trusting  walledin  i had become not consciously so but just this armour that i kind of have protective armour its not for my friends or family but for beingoutside in the world always on guard im a girl from a good family who was very well brought up one day i turned my back on it all and became a bohemian everybody has basically the same family its just reconfigured slightly differently from one to the next together we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy healthy choice i missed my home  like the physicality of my home i missed my friends and my family mostly and just hanging out and being in your home country  culturally it feels right and that is what i miss leave the presidents family business to him you will have plenty to do without trying to manage the first family they are likely to do fine without your help for the nugent family fast food is a running herbivore but with the steady disintegration of the family in modern society over the last century the role of the school in bridging the gap has become vital i was raised by a single mother who made a way for me she used to scrub floors as a domestic worker put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in brooklyn so i would have food on the table but she taught me as i walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start but where youre going thats family values and when i was young my family was perfectly nice i write a lot about it as you noticed but it was rather limited i think i dont think anyone in my family would really feel id done them an injustice by saying that we didnt see many people there were many books it was as if i wanted to get away from home like family we are tied to each other this is what all good musicians understand my parents were french and irish and our family even has spanish bloodand i do so love the united states and consider myself part american i just want my family to be safe because i am sometimes polarizing i fear for their safety people under the influence of cults is similar to that we observe in addicts typical behaviour for both includes draining bank accounts neglecting children destroying relations with family and losing interest in anything except the drug or cult the question of the family now divides our society so deeply that the opposing sides cannot even agree on a definition of the institution they are arguing about my family got all over me because they said bush is only for the rich people then i reminded them hey im rich there can be hope only for a society which acts as one big family not as many separate ones my kids say if theres any family dinner that doesnt result in somebody crying its not a good dinner they cry because it helps relieve them of a guilt or some onerous emotional burden its like a family tradition growing up in a particular neighborhood growing up in a workingclass family not having much money all of those things fire you and can give you an edge can give you an anger im healthy have a loving and adorable family great hunting dogs a gravity defying musical career and most importantly fuzzyheaded idiots hate me do it no matter what if you believe in it it is something very honorable if somebody around you or your family does not understand it then thats their problem but if you do have a passion an honest passion just do it because i didnt have brothers i was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family so i became one of them  but it was not my family ive always been attracted to temporary families they tend to be lost characters woman is the salvation or the destruction of the family she carries its destiny in the folds of her mantle i love when i go out and i have my hair and makeup done but i also like it when im just with the family because thats real in five years time id like to be a mum i want to settle down and have a family definitely sooner rather than later id like to have finished my second album too maybe even my third id like a sound that sticks around that other people are inspired by and that people know is me my mom is the backbone not just of my family but of many families familys first and thats what matters most we realize that our love goes deeper than the tennis game im thankful to my family friends and fans for all of their support over the last couple of years ive really worked toward balancing my life out more having a little bit more time with friends family and my boyfriend there was a period of time when they were way down the list it was all about music and touring and if everything fell by the wayside so be it it is time to return to core values time to get back to basics  to selfdiscipline and respect for the law to consideration for the others to accepting responsibility for yourself and your family  and not shuffling it off on other people and the state theres a bond among a kitchen staff i think you spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family i really love being alive i love my family and my work i love the opportunity i have to do things thats what happiness is the true poet for me is a priest as soon as he dons the cassock he must leave his family the only people that you really have that i learned are your family because they love you no matter what when i do get the chance i just love to hang around at home with friends and family women are in my view natural peacemakers as givers and nurturers of life through their focus on human relationships and their engagement with the demanding work of raising children and protecting family life they develop a deep sense of empathy that cuts through to underlying human realities a family on the throne is an interesting idea it brings down the pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life one thing that was passed on from generation to generation in my family over seven generations in 200 years was never give up thats the way we live protecting the institution of marriage safeguards i believe the american family i know im talented but i wasnt put here to sing i was put here to be a wife and a mom and look after my family i love what i do but its not where it begins and ends the steady expansion of welfare programs can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the negro family structure over the past generation in the united states i came from a poor family so working and going to school at the same time was natural it taught me multitasking although we didnt call it that back then i learned i could never be idle i need to be doing many things at once every adolescent has that dream every century has that dream every revolutionary has that dream to destroy the family the greenest home is the one you dont build if you really want to save the earth move in with another family and share a house thats already built better yet live in the forest and eat whatever the squirrels dont want im a teenager but im independent  i have my own apartment i have my own life and i think i have learned more than any of those teenagers have in school i learned to be responsible leaving my family and coming here alone its hard enough to work and raise a family when your kids are all healthy and relatively normal but when you add on some kind of disability or disease it can just be such a burden when you look at prince charles dont you think that someone in the royal family knew someone in the royal family the follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family their friends people who should be supportive going what are you talking about even just seemingly regular career paths but if its not what people expect for you they kind of react funny when you live on the road going home is a place to escape and just be with your family to unwind i am just happy to be part of the nike family i dont see how the party that says its the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century going home and spending time with your family and your real friends keeps you grounded a familys photograph album is generally about the extended family and often is all that remains of it i had to learn my faith and look after my family and i had to make priorities but now ive done it all and theres a little space for me to fill in the universe of music again we must not allow the liberals to move us away from the conservative values of the american past which sustain our present and shall secure our future as for me and my family we will serve god we will serve this constitutional republic we will serve america and so i look at it as a relationship that i have with him that i want to give him the honor and glory anytime i have the opportunity and then right after i give him the honor and glory i always try to give my teammates the honor and glory and thats how it works because christ comes first in my life and then my family and then my teammates being a barrymore didnt help me other than giving me a great sense of pride and a strange spiritual sense that i felt ok about having the passion to act it made sense because my whole family had done it and it helped rationalise it for me i grew up in a family that was multifaceted sexually oriented and pretty much open to everything and because i was working my friends were all adults i had a tough time going to different schools because people knew me from films and i was the fat child who got beaten up every day i really have created a family i work with the people i love i travel with them i make films with them and im in an office with them so in a weird way  i know i havent birthed a child  i feel that im a part of creating a family its a tribe i love that word when i did et it sort of solidified the only family i know are these film crews these gypsies these filmmakers that was the solidification and the clicking revelations of this is what i want to do with my life and this is where im going to survive i want to make sure my familys straight if you have issues with family friends and people at work try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want think about what you can do so that you are happy with yourself  for instance eating right to feel great and energetic my family isnt really all that different from anyone elses well maybe theyre a bit more entertaining my other family is fleetwood mac i dont need the money but theres an emotional need for me to go on the road again theres a love there were a band of brothers look i think hispanic community  the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative they are faith family and patriotism as a child the family that i had and the love i had from my two parents allowed me to go ahead and be more aggressive to search and to take risks knowing that if i failed i could always come home to a family of love and support i have let my family down and i regret those transgressions with all of my heart i bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff and as soon as i could i wasted a lot of money on cars  bmws mostly  for myself and my family it is awesome to feel you are carrying on the family name my inspiration was my mom shes a great cook and she still cooks and we still banter back and forth about cooking growing up in a mostly portuguese community food was important and the family table was extremely important at a very young age i understood that i feel akin to the platypus an orphan in a family a swimmer a recluse part bird part fish part lizard i think the american dream says that anything can happen if you work hard enough at it and are persistent and have some ability the sky is the limit to what you can build and what can happen to you and your family the lover of life makes the whole world into his family just as the lover of the fair sex creates his from all the lovely women he has found from those that could be found and those who are impossible to find i am so excited to let fans in on how important my relationship with my family is to me i hope to motivate mothers and daughters to build lifetimes of memories together and inspire kids around the world to live their dreams my family really does come first it always did and always will men have looked upon the desert as barren land the free holding of whoever chose but in fact each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged owner and would quickly assert the right of his family or clan to it against aggression it was the dumbest thing i had ever seen but its a family thing and i guess its clean family and friends and faith are the most important things in your life and you should be building friendships you know sit with your arm around a little kid and read it not only teaches them to read but it keeps the family strong i dont think a female running a house is a problem a broken family its perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man i want to be a young dad by 25 or 26 i want to see myself like married or start looking for a family i like to be judged by my family and friends because they know me i come from a very nonaccepting family but im very accepting i grew up not really having anything so the idea that i can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus when you live in an alcoholic family or an abusive family you tiptoe you dont want to step on any mines americas a family we all yell at each other it all works out the blues was like that problem child that you may have had in the family you was a little bit ashamed to let anybody see him but you loved him you just didnt know how other people would take it i have a very good family im very fortunate to have a very good family i believe very strongly in the family its one of the things we have in our platform is to talk about it it did remind me of something out of greek mythology  the richest king who gets everything he wants but ultimately his family has a curse on it from the gods the fact that food plays such an important part in my films has everything to do with my family a lot of what im obsessed with is the relationship and the dynamics between people and the family particularly brothers and their father but i also want to have a family with children one day which is very important to me with a family of six there is always something to make create and do together sure climbing mount everest would be cool but thats something i would now like to do as a family big experiences like that i dont want to have on my own anymore i want to share them family comes first youre the only thing they have im not a kid you dont get in this business for anonymity its not like i have posters of myself on the wall but at the same time im kind of ready for a little bit of it but i worry for my little one and my family  their privacy thats what im more protective of my parents were drawn to the idea that there was space and opportunity in australia for the meagre sum of pound10 you could sail your entire family out to australia so thats what my father chose to do my family my parents are hippies i enjoy what im able to give my family my familys lineage is five generations of artists who never made it personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldnt have to mean public confessions i have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves i hurt my wife my kids my mother my wifes family my friends my foundation and kids all around the world who admired me i get 05 seconds to react to a ball sometimes even less than that i cant be thinking of what xyz has said about me i need to surrender myself to my natural instincts my subconscious mind knows exactly what to do it is trained to react at home my family doesnt discuss media coverage my ultimate life dream project is my kids my family i remember driving to north carolina when i was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my moms family in the carolinas there were chains on the car  it was the late sixties  and we were just singing in the car christmas carols the principal contributor to loneliness in this country is television what happens is that the family gets together alone i cant tell you how scary it can be walking onto a movie and suddenly joining this family its like going to somebody elses christmas dinner everyone knows everyone and youre there and youre not quite sure what youre supposed to be doing no doubt the white house thinks the american people know obamas story but since the inauguration weve seen only the presidents present his perfect family his ivy league elegance his effortless mastery of complex issues we never see him sweat and we forget that he ever had to struggle one if you attack my integrity i will defend myself if you attack my patriotism i will defend myself if you come after my family i will counterattack viciously i will destroy you but if each man could have his own house a large garden to cultivate and healthy surroundings  then i thought there will be for them a better opportunity of a happy family life a home is crucial the foundation of a stable family im a strong person im a strong family man im a strong husband and a strong father my mom has made it possible for me to be who i am our family is everything her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence acting is just a way of making a living the family is life im from a lower middle class background all my family were immigrants in my particular instance i came from a family that didnt have anything everything i earned in life i made myself with songs that i wrote at a familys most difficult time i want to make sure at a minimum that they have the very basic of comforts the ability to grieve their loss privately and the knowledge that their country is grateful for their loved ones sacrifice and service if you want to see mankind fully look at a family within the family minds become organically one and for this reason the family is total poetry i had a really wonderful upbringing we were a tight family it was wonderful to grow up with so many siblings we were all just a year or two apart and we were always so supportive of each other i learned everything from my older brother and sister and taught it to my younger sisters i need my family to remind me in a loving and nice way to lighten up i have to make it my job to be careful with my family my wife my family my friends  theyve all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means in a nutshell loving someone is about giving not receiving my dad would give me 10 which is a lot of money when youre 9 to sing at church on tables at restaurants at family functions just about anywhere santa barbara is my hood i mean its not much of a hood but it is definitely like my hood i claim santa barbara like i claim my family im going to be married and buried there the family only represents one aspect however important an aspect of a human beings functions and activities a life is beautiful and ideal or the reverse only when we have taken into our consideration the social as well as the family relationship i come from a great family ive seen family life and i know how wonderful how nurturing and how wonderful it can be we will invest in our people quality education job opportunity family neighborhood and yes a thing we call america too often older women are seen as victims but i know lots of formidable women who have marvellous jobs as well as a full erotic life and children and friends and family i love where im from i dont live there because of the circumstances but all my family is there its whats inside its not whats outside that determines the culture and the feeling our notion of the perfect society embraces the family as its center and ornament and this paradise is not secure until children appear to animate and complete the picture i play with my grandchildren i tend to my garden which i love of course i love to read and family is really what its all about i draw from my family and my friends and i feel like that smalltown person the achievements the materialistic possessions have really become to mean less they mean nothing i am hoping that in this year of the family we will go into our families and reconcile differences i did come from a pretty independentminded family i think my father would have liked to have been an artist actually but i think he didnt quite have perhaps the drive or i dont know i mean he had a family to bring up i suppose i hate the way they portray us in the media if you see a black family it says theyre looting if you see a white family it says theyre looking for food there are just so many stories that are buried on family trees i do not see my family life in any way shape or form as an opportunity for a photo my mother at least twice cancelled our familys subscription to the newspaper i was working on because she was so mad about its treatment of my father as they say in italy italians were eating with a knife and fork when the french were still eating each other the medici family had to bring their tuscan cooks up there so they could make something edible having family responsibilities and concerns just has to make you a more understanding person a retired teacher paid 62000 towards her pension and nothing yes nothing for full family medical dental and vision coverage over her entire career what will we pay her 14 million in pension benefits and another 215000 in health care benefit premiums over her lifetime for the first time ever i was taking the family on the road we stayed with my inlaws which on lifes list of experiences ranks right below sitting in a tub full of scissors there is an overwhelming amount of information available to us all on the web each day not to mention what is shared with us by our family friends fans and followers this necessitates the need to filter through all that information and to decide for ourselves where to put our attention i love my friends and family but i also love it when they cant find me and i can spend all day reading or walking all alone in silence eight thousand miles away from everyone all alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be they say yogi berra is funny well he has a lovely wife and family a beautiful home money in the bank and he plays golf with millionaires whats funny about that im thankful for all the things that this job has given me and my family but probably the thing that i am most proud of throughout my career is that not only myself but my family and the people around me have just been regular people which we are i do believe at the end of the night when youre with your family the character gets hung up on the door like a coat and is there to be taken on the next morning theres an honesty in our family  my kids and i are able to talk about things without me putting the fear of god into them you cannot be happy with your family while being personally unhappy with your work its a catch22 kind of thing because of my own familys service in the us army navy and massachusetts and new york national guard i am a strong supporter of the military and do believe that there are just wars except for naval and air exercises our military should be stationed on american soil where service men and women can lead normal lives in close proximity to family and friends i want to do as little as possible when i finish playing ball  just spend a lot more time with my family i know its a cliche but the whole family is just whacked i mean were all out of our minds theyre the funniest most eccentric bizarre people ive ever met my siblings only solitary men know the full joys of frienship others have their family but to a solitary and an exile his friends are everything parenthood and family come first for me and when im not working im cool with the teletubbies studies have shown that since women have had access to the pill and family planning measures they have made huge gains in both wages and in careers that were dominated by men for families across the uk who are incomepoor but more than that whose lives are blighted by worklessness educational failure family breakdown problem debt and poor health as well as other problems giving them an extra pound  say through increased benefits  will not address the reason they find themselves in difficulty in the first place mental illness is the last frontier the gay thing is part of everyday life now on a show like modern family but mental illness is still full of stigma maybe it is time for that to change if anything interferes with my inner peace i will walk away arguments with family members all that stuff none of it matters it is no longer an unwritten law of american capitalism that industry will attempt to maintain wages at a level that allows a single wage to support a family the family wage has been eroded by the same developments that have promoted consumerism as a way of life in a big family the first child is kind of like the first pancake if its not perfect thats okay there are a lot more coming along im worried about that man or woman sitting around  the coffee table tonight or in their kitchen talking about how are we going to get to work how are we going to have the dignity to take care of our family i have been called a nun with a switchblade where my privacy is concerned i think theres a point where one says thats for family thats for me my sense of the family history is somewhat sketchy because my mother kept a great deal to herself never refuse an assignment except when there is a conflict of interest a potential of danger to you or your family or you hold a strongly biased attitude about the subject under focus the last thing family and friends want is for you to spend money on them that you dont have or that you cant really spare i believe there are three keys to success for me it is keeping my priorities in order its my faith and my family and then the business my friends ask me why i still live with my family but i feel comfortable there weve all been through so much together i know my family and i would always go up to the mountains just for fun we always skied then all of a sudden my brother started snow boarding older brother thing i had to do what he was doing so i started snow boarding i sang in the choir for years even though my family belonged to another church my father was the center of the family and everyone tried to please him thinking back to those earlier days i felt i was weak when i wasnt making movies and then when i was i thought i was weak as a family member soon we saw that money going to women brought much more benefit to the family than money going to the men so we changed our policy and gave a high priority to women as a result now 96 of our four million borrowers in grameen bank are women the first responsibility of the muslim is as teacher that is his job to teach his first school his first classroom is within the household his first student is himself he masters himself and then he begins to convey the knowledge that he has acquired to the family the people who are closest to him i come from a family of losers and ive rejected my family as something i dont want to be like i have an obligation to try to live as long as i can for my family my goal is to get everybody in america to do their family tree if you share a common ancestor with somebody youre related to them it doesnt mean that youre going to invite them to the family reunion but it means that you share dna if you share a common ancestor with somebody youre related to them it doesnt mean that youre going to invite them to the family reunion but it means that you share dna i think its fascinating the bottom line is that wanda sykes has the longest continuously documented family tree of any africanamerican we have ever researched my family and our neighbors and friends thought of africa and its africans as extensions of the stereotyped characters that we saw in movies and on television in films such as tarzan and in programs such as ramar of the jungle and sheena queen of the jungle you can say i had a severe case of roots envy i wanted to be like alex haley and i wanted to be able to do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the middle passage as i like to put it and find the tribe or ethnic group that i was from in africa so when you do your family tree and margaret cho does hers and wanda sykes and john legend were adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the american experience and thats the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship the death of any man aged 56 is very sad for his widow and family and no one would deny that steve jobs was a brilliant and highly innovative technician with great business flair and marketing ability it seems to me that unless you or someone very close to you has had a bad head injury you really cant fathom it you have no concept of what it is all about it was so difficult for my whole family not just me seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend i come from an italian family one of the greatest and most profound expressions we would ever use in conversations or arguments was a slamming door the slamming door was our punctuation mark you follow any family around youre going to see elation youre going to see disharmony the family teaches us about the importance of knowledge education hard work and effort it teaches us about enjoying ourselves having fun keeping fit and healthy only as far as a man is happily married to himself is he fit for married life and family life in general i have had lots of friends whove been affected by aids and a very good friend of mine oscar moore died of aids and i was with him in his last year quite a bit and of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care i understand what its like to come with your family and to uproot yourself and come to another culture you need a lot of support people say shes got her daughter shes got her husband yeah but she hasnt got anyone else the real estate agent had to go doortodoor in the apartment building we wanted to rent asking if it was ok for this interracial family  my mom is white and i was a 1yearold halfafrican kid  to live in the apartment building the rooneys are very classy theyre very deliberate with their decisionmaking once youre part of that family steeler nation they treat you with respect you dont have a lot of rambunctious players running around in every song i write whether its a love song or a political song or a song about family the one thing that i find is feeling lost and trying to find your way i wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field it had a great psychological effect on the opposing team too theyd never seen anything like it i now have two different audiences theres the one that has been watching my action films for 20 years and the american family audience american jokes less fighting no one can find inner peace except by working not in a self centered way but for the whole human family my grandfathers family used to own a pasta factory in naples and they would go doortodoor selling their pasta so his love of food came from his parents which was then passed down to my mother and then again to me i work more now because at this time of my life i am not disturbed from my aim by outside pressures such as family passionate relationships dealing with who am i  those complications when one is searching for ones self i have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and have a family women are nearly always seen as victims like all best families we have our share of eccentricities of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements im often asked if i regret not going to hollywood im glad i didnt go because if i had i wouldnt have my extended family which is the fabric of my life only recently have i realised how special and unusual it is i have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and also have a family they are nearly always seen as victims music was your real passion this thing you held dear even above family it was this relationship that never betrayed you once it became your job  this thing that was highly visible this thing that became about commerce  thats when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane a ball player has to be kept hungry to become a big leaguer thats why no boy from a rich family has ever made the big leagues for those who are able to work work has to be seen as the best route out of poverty for work is not just about more money  it is transformative its about taking responsibility for yourself and your family id like to have a family whenever i have friends over we end up eating and talking and losing track of time and once in a while singing karaoke it reminds me of the family meals we had in russia which always lasted a very long time thats a tradition i miss my family and i built my whole career from scratch my family is awesome i support concrete and progressive immigration reform based on three primary criteria family reunification economic contributions and humanitarian concerns i cant imagine dating a boy meeting him only outside the home whats a home and family for if its not the center of ones life my wife a schoolteacher very disciplined if you think im tough trust me and wait till you see when the children are on the naughty step its hilarious so we decided that im going to work like a donkey and provide amazing support for the family the dirty little secret is that the pool man whos making 30000 a year is subsidizing the milliondollar mortgage for the family whose pool he cleans no wonder people want to get rid of tax breaks for corporate jets my father who died a few years ago was a good simple very honest man his faith and affection for his family was just unassailable without question you go to a restaurant in the states and kids have these game boards at the table you dont see that in italy or spain its not because they cant afford to buy them its because thats not what eating together as a family is about stay out of the sun because it is the worst thing in terms of aging im very medical i come from a medical family i dont hide my feelings but when it comes to illness i guess i dont panic my father was the same way im the provider for the family and the caretaker if i panic who is anybody going to run to if you dont have public hangings for bad culture in a company if you dont take people out and let them say they went home to spend more time with the family its crazy i am suspending my presidential campaign because of the continued distractions the continued hurt caused on me and my family not because we are not fighters not because im not a fighter thats a central part of philosophy of ethics what do i owe to strangers what do i owe to my family what is it to live a good life those are questions which we face as individuals catholic school graduates exhibit a wide variety of qualities that will not only help them in their careers but also in their family and community lives i grew up in a navy family we were never a family that had a lot we had enough but not a lot growing up in an italian family you use a harsh tone and 10 minutes later everybody forgets about it family life was wonderful the streets were bleak the playgrounds were bleak but home was always warm my mother and father had a great relationship i always felt safe there fundamentalists are panicked by the apparent disintegration of the family the disappearance of certainty and the decay of morality fear leads them to ask if we cannot trust the bible what can we trust the universal declaration of human rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society it follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself and cannot be made by anyone else theres something about being with a group of people who become like family that must be needed in society in turkey youre not allowed to be left alone in the hospital the nurse teaches the family how to do things and somebody is always there with the patient young actors often dont think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes they want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited and then end up embarrassing family friends and even strangers i just want to be healthy and stay alive and keep my family going and everything and keep my friends going and try to do something so that this world will be peaceful that is the most ambitious and the most difficult thing but im there trying to do it you dont have to give birth to someone to have a family i grew up in a family where the women were just nuts they didnt stand around in cardigans making polite conversation while they chopped tomatoes i am very lucky i have a very tight group of friends and a very supportive family and to this date noone has ever sold a story on me im lucky to have family around me otherwise ill be taking the risk of falling in love with myself i want to apologize to all of the people i have let down because of my behavior which has reflected badly on my family friends coworkers business associates and others women know what men have long forgotten the ultimate economic and spiritual unit of any civilization is still the family the bible is the great family chronicle of the jews even if you plan a marriage and a family you are never quite prepared for the reality versus how you imagined it in a lot of ways its better and in a lot of ways its worse thats life right but when you lose a family member or something tragic happens that stays with you forever you never get over it knowing that you have to deal with that for the rest of your life football is important but not as important as you once thought it was doing saturday night live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family because you feel so much pressure to do well that night but i think everyones grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show we have a president who stole the presidency through family ties arrogance and intimidation employing republican operatives to exercise the tactics of voter fraud by disenfranchising thousands of blacks elderly jews and other minorities by the time i was 30 nobody would work with me i was friendless i was hopeless i was suicidal lost my family  i mean it was bad bottomed out didnt know what i was going to do i actually thought i was going to be a chef  go to work in a kitchen someplace never write an advertisement which you wouldnt want your family to read you wouldnt tell lies to your own wife dont tell them to mine growing up i was taught that a man has to defend his family when the wolf is trying to get in you gotta stand in the doorway what i got which was unusual especially as a child actress was parents who believed that hollywood was not that important they told us education family health all come first and they meant it all my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets andor people i have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way i think the family movie is very important to everybody right now im getting older now so i should think about a family but certainly not tomorrow im less worried about accomplishment  as younger people always cant help but be  and more concerned with spending my time well spending time with my family and reading learning things if you see a black family its looting but if its a white family they are looking for food my own mother always taught me that fairness was a family value  i think equal pay is about fairness for everyone i always tried to do things by example even though i was not a very good mother regarding routines and family life being rich is a good thing not just in the obvious sense of benefitting you and your family but in the broader sense profits are not a zero sum game the more you make the more of a financial impact you can have people had this image of the jacksons as the perfect american family and i destroyed that image but what people have to understand is writing that book was very healing for me i married him because he told me it was the only way he could protect me if we were just manager and client my family could do whatever they wanted to get me back but if i was his wife they couldnt i cant say its not painful being estranged from most of my family i wish it could be otherwise outside of being home with my family i prefer a crowd ive never had a very closely connected family my parents split up when i was young and i was living with my mom for a little while then i was kind of just on my own really young it wasnt some kind of global tragedy it was just never really a very closeknit family so there was support in the sense that they didnt stand in my way ap promoted me to the white house beat because i knew clinton his family friends and staff better than anybody in the national press corps those contacts helped me break a few stories and get my career in washington jumpstarted we all wish we could be in more than one place at the same time people with families feel guilty all the timeif we spend too much time with our family we feel were not working hard enough you know every family and every business in california knows what it means to go through tough times i was one those kids who had books on them before weddings bar mitzvahs funerals and anything else where youre actually meant to not be reading my family would frisk me and take the book away if they didnt find it by this point in the procedure i would be sitting over in that corner completely unnoticed just reading my book a growing awareness of the depth of popular attachment to the family has led some liberals to concede that family is not just a buzzword for reaction when you look at a family if you have a family that never interacts with each other never has strong conversation with each other never has disagreements nine times out of ten you have a very cold family and theyre not going to be at the end theyre not going to be close i dont have a saviour or a royal family most evangelicals claim to be politically nonpartisan and say they only identify with the republican party because the republicans are committed to family values i for one am quite willing to join the forgive forget and move on crowd but it does make me wonder if evangelicals are going to sound believable when they say that they tend to vote republican because of their religious commitments to the family the traditional spokespersons for the evangelicals such as chuck colson and james dobson have become alarmed about this drift away from the family values issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of evangelicals they have expressed their displeasure in letters of protest circulated through the religious media i only tour in short bursts im only ever away from my family and three daughters for a month or two everybody sung in my family well i have a cbe and i accepted it with glee because its not bestowed on you by the royal family its not bestowed on you by the government you have to be nominated by the public i have often noticed that ancestors never boast of the descendants who boast of ancestors i would rather start a family than finish one blood will tell but often it tells too much they needed someone to write a script of the great gatsby very quickly for the movie they were making i took this job so id be sure to have some dough to support my family i had a number of very strong personalities in my family my father was a concert flutist the solo flute for toscanini for my own family i would always choose the makeshift surrogate family formed by various characters unrelated by blood i think thats become passe but if you can surround yourself with a kind of monument to yourself and your family  a statement  and you can afford it then thats a noble project im not ready to get married but i have a pretty great family and id like that too someday i have a great family by the way but you need to find people who can pull something out from you that might be otherwise unseen its not an accident that both my sister and i are writers our parents created an accidental petri dish my family has great storytellers and i grew up in a very funny conversational house and didnt have television this small family farm was a bubble world that didnt have much to do with reality a family is very special so when a family splits up its not good its never good it never occurred to me that i wouldnt go to college and have a career  as well as a family  of my own both my parents but especially my mother encouraged me and led me to believe that it was possible after all is said that can be said upon the liquor traffic its influence is degrading upon the individual the family politics and business and upon everything that you touch in this old world i grew up in a family of strong women and i owe any capacity i have to understand women to my mother and big sister they taught me to respect women in a way where ive always felt a strong emotional connection to women which has also helped me in the way i approach my work as an actor life is not a matter of place things or comfort rather it concerns the basic human rights of family country justice and human dignity i dont think quantity time is as special as quality time with your family interesting things come your way but as you get older your lifestyle changes i dont want to travel i dont want to be in a hotel room away from my family we all started snowboarding in the beginning as a family just to be closer together go on trips it was our soccer but instead of dad yelling at me from the sideline he is there riding with me and hitting the jumps even before i am hitting them in every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it and given a family character as it were to the century family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the 90s version of it instead of just watching you can do it together something we dont spend enough time on we can motivate and excite each other about fitness my priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now thats a huge huge thing i think everybody has their own way of looking at their lives as some kind of pilgrimage some people will see their role as a pilgrim in terms of setting up a fine family or establishing a business inheritance everyones got their own definition nobody in my family ever thought that id a be a model i miss my family and i like being a tourist when i go back we need to recognise that what really matters isnt buying more and more consumer goods but family friends and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives helping to reduce the appalling consequences of world poverty should be part of that reassessment theres no road map on how to raise a family its always an enormous negotiation if you wish to spare yourself and your venerable family give heed to my advice with the ear of intelligence if you do not you will see what god has willed individual responsibility hard work paying attention in school faith family all these things are important i think its been a little difficult at times for the audience because theyve told me they see me as a family member so to see your little sister sing about sex i think they are pretty used to it now the secret is to make sure your family comes before anything else because no matter what you do youve got to come home i want a baby and i want a family for sure syria should not belong to one family to one coterie or to one party it belongs to all the people of syria equally in all their religious and ethnic diversity my family is my life and ill never lose that i guess now that i think back i used to play priest and be a funny priest i dont know i grew up in such a catholic family that i kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and i think i had fun watching my mom laugh in the family sandwich the older people and the younger ones can recognize one another as the bread those in the middle are for a time the meat ive been screaming at the top of my lungs at my family work out work out old age is coming im still very connected to my family to the world i grew up in i understand what it means to be afraid that you cant pay a doctors bill or to have to make the choice between buying a band uniform for a seventhgrader and making the insurance payment on time that will never leave me it was how i lived until i was well into my adult years like a lot of you i grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class my daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man after he had a heart attack my mom worked the phones at sears so we could hang on to our house i do all of the grocery shopping in my little family i buy cheese of many different kinds sliced packaged meats and poultry bagels immense quantities of eggs premade fried chicken milk bacon it is insane how much dairy deli and bakery stuff i buy personally i think four is the perfect number of children for our particular family four is enough to create the frenzied cacophony that my husband and i find so joyful liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family as a novelist i mined my history my family and my memory but in a very specific way writing fiction i never made use of experiences immediately as they happened i needed to let things fester in my memory mature and transmogrify into something meaningful opponents of capital punishment argue that the state has no right to take a murderers life apparently one fact that abolitionists forget or overlook is that the state is acting not only on behalf of society but also on behalf of the murdered person and the murdered persons family during the periods in my marriage when i chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney it caused me no end of anxiety despite the fact that i knew i was contributing to our family by caring for our children i still felt that my worth was less because i wasnt earning for all of higher civilizations recorded history becoming a man was defined overwhelmingly as taking responsibility for a family family farms and small businesses are the backbone of our communities my works never been accepted by my family but its something ill always carry on with i am a big fan of smelly cheeses but the rest of the family dont seem to be particularly keen on them i love being around my friends and my family and spending time with my husband i like being normal and recharging my batteries and i feel like i have the coolest job in the world where i get to get on stage and perform and get to do a lot of really amazing things when there is time to think about cricket i think but when there is time to be with family i try to do justice to that aspect of my life as well many a man who pays rent all his life owns his own home and many a family has successfully saved for a home only to find itself at last with nothing but a house ive been to all 50 states and traveled this whole country and 90 percent of the people are good folks the rest of them take after the other side of the family my wife is so analytical with raising kids and i am not my feeling is if they turn out good then that means i was a good daddy and put a lot of effort into it if they turn out bad it means they took after her side of the family my father never talked about the sacrifices that the family made for me its not common for a woman on television especially if shes the mom of the family to be funny shes usually a straight man or foil its long been accepted as fact that the availability of family planning services saves lives where women have access to these services children and families are healthier and society at large benefits i cant move back to england my home is in france now id love to but i cant my familys all there now i always wanted my music to influence the life you were living emotionally  with your family your lover your wife and at a certain point with your children adoption has been a part of my life and a part of my family so it was how i wanted to start it felt natural and right to me i want my family to resemble the family i came from the town the team its a family that has helped for some people who have had to deal with some of the problems i have had to deal with dont have football as an out we really were a very musical family father managed to buy us a small pump organ and i just loved this instrument by 1969 when i celebrated 45 years in the music business i also had 45 people in our musical family this character feels so much like my brother he has two children he has a wife he works with me he chooses to stay in new hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with he doesnt want them to lose friends he is his familys hero the problem with me as far as getting married and having a family is that my comedy is so important to me so i dont know if ill ever be as good a dad as my dad sometimes you cant prioritise family and you feel guilty ive always wanted to do a family movie i have other obligations now  the show my family my life though i know that without my sobriety i wouldnt have any of those things when i was working and when i was making substantial amounts of money i always filed and paid my taxes this only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society in order to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of myself and my family the pictures of my family were designed to be on a family wall they were supposed to be together it was supposed to copy my mothers wall in her house you never know when some small thing will lead to a big idea travel is very inspirational  but its in the ordinary that i find my themes of love and work and family the monarchy is foremost a business and its important to them that the british public continue to finance the excessive luxurious lifestyles of the now quite enormous wasteful and useless royal family i find it very sad american horror is the debasement of the suburban family the way a lonely kid would have imagined it in the seventies im not an anarchist but i believe that people dont want the royal family  the socalled royal family my dad was a militant atheist or is a militant atheist my mum was sort of bought up in a religious family because she was a protestant from ireland but wasnt especially religious if you want to really know what your friends and family think of you die broke and then see who shows up for the funeral i have a mother thats very strong and family that surround me and constantly tell me they love me i approached everything my job my family my romances with intensity none of my actions have ever sort of been motored by the search for a husband or wondering if i was going to have a family someday or wanting to live in a really great house or thinking it would be really great to have a diamond a lot of parents never speak to their transgender kids again thats not the case in my family the purpose of the seder to my mind is to inspire conversations with your family about the human drama and hopefully transmit values to the next generation ive always felt like this could be better we need a better way to talk about eating animals a way that doesnt ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits cravings family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation the more they are allowed in the more able we will be to follow our best instincts im happiest with my family around me all the songs i write are about human dynamics whether its with girlfriends boyfriends or family we expect teachers to handle teenage pregnancy substance abuse and the failings of the family then we expect them to educate our children i eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything everything in moderation i know thats really hard for people to understand but i grew up in an italian family where we didnt overdo anything we ate pasta yes but not a lot of it when i go back to family reunions everybody goes hey cousin hey auntie and im like okay i dont know you i have no idea who you are i am auntie and cousin for so many and even the ones in prison call me collect and ill be like which of my family members are giving you this phone number im the git in the family a loving family provides the foundation children need to succeed and strong families with a man and a woman  bonded together for life  always have been and always will be the key to such families people can undergo a sudden change of thinking and loyalties under threat of death or intense social pressure and isolation from friends and family i would look at a dog and when our eyes met i realized that the dog and all creatures are my family theyre like you and me my family and friends treat me as they always have my health and my family are the core of my being broken relationships are a source of heavy heartbreak that seem to affect every family i do come from a strong family liberals subscribe to the new flexible pluralistic definition of the family their defense of families carries no conviction most women are pragmatists who have allowed extremists on the left and right to manipulate the family issue for their own purposes the last three decades have seen the collapse of the family wage system the left ask people to believe that there is no conflict between feminism and the family im not asking that people accept homosexuality im not asking that they believe like i do that its inborn im not asking that all im saying is dont let these children suffer without a family because of your bias the left sees nothing but bigotry and superstition in the popular defense of the family or in popular attitudes regarding abortion crime busing and the school curriculum if you go from a structure where you have the support and that partner and that construction of a family and thats broken apart i think thats probably a lot harder than always being a single mom and having the father being a support in another area when liberals finally grasped the strength of popular feeling about the family they cried to appropriate the rhetoric and symbolism of family values for their own purposes how do you rebel in a family of rebels my dads whole family is in madras and i was born in america so we didnt have that big indian community i dont really have anything interesting to say about it when i talk about it people are like meh lets talk about something else i am like a kid i tell my family and friends im like a kid you might think that after thousands of years of coming up too soon and getting frozen the crocus family would have had a little sense knocked into it from very early on in my childhood  four five years old  i felt alien to the human race i felt very comfortable with thinking i was from another planet because i felt disconnected  i was very tall and skinny and i didnt look like anybody else i didnt even look like any member of my family a rumor that followed me forever was that my family was in the mafia for years i had to live with it theyd call me the mafia princess so i rolled with it for the rest of high school people even joke about it today instead of plotting the demise of the traditional family as some politicians and religious leaders would have you believe gay people mow their lawns and watch american idol and video their childrens concerts and have the same hopes and dreams that their straight counterparts do my whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes my encounters with racism are sort of secondhand situations where i might be standing around with a group of white friends and someone makes a comment that they wouldnt make at my family reunion heres the thing the unit of reverence in europe is the family which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in america here we revere the couple there they revere the family sometimes you struggle so hard to feed your family one way you forget to feed them the other way with spiritual nourishment everybody needs that thank you to everyone that has made me the athlete i am god family and friends my competitors and supporters you have all had a hand in my family in the days prior to television we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously my idea of perfect happiness is a healthy family peace between nations and all the critics die one person may need or want more leisure another more work one more adventure another more security and so on it is this diversity that makes a country indeed a state a city a church or a family healthy onesizefitsall and that size determined by the state has a name and that name is slavery our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit santa who was jolly  but lets face it he was also very judgmental the family is the school of duties  founded on love my family were from jamaica i believe in god family truth between people the power of love my family always had the value of the family table and these cultural influences of growing up well be going to the fish market and a farmers market this afternoon to get what we need to make and eat dinner as a family im trying to expose my kids to going to a farmers market or the fish market and learning what thats all about when nirvana became popular you could very easily slip and get lost during that storm i fortunately had really heavy anchors  old friends family my mother was passionate she was stubborn the dominant one in the family she dominated my father my mother was the first woman in the county in indiana where we were born in jay county to have a college degree she was educated as a pianist and she wanted to concertize but when the war came she was married had a family so she started teaching at this time when i turn 50 because so theres many of my friends and family who didnt get to see 50yearsold and so im celebrating for them too there is only one way to solve the alleged crisis of the erosion of family values and that is to get right down to the root cause of the problem my family you know are all still you know very close were all still very close mom and daddy are still alive so what more can you ask for your kids are healthy my whole familys been in the business my whole family is crazy my goals have changed throughout my life at one time it was winning awards selling out concert dates selling more albums than anyone else now my goals are to see my grandchildren grown live a long and healthy life with my family and friends and travel the world if you want to look at the state of humans you should look at the state of animals first people are choosing whether or not they can feed an animal and their family and every shelter coasttocoast is stuffed diabetes affects my family one of my kids is affected by it i really appreciate family i really cant imagine life without them its a tremendous responsibility to be direct descendants of the prophet muhammad this family has had the burden of leadership on its shoulders for 1400 years im not going to drop the ball on my shift at one point in my life i was very involved with social causes im still involved but now i have a family and its important to me i have one friend that ive had since i was born and shes from coatzacoalcos shes not really impressed or interested in the actors life my family isnt really either from those to whom much is given much is expected i have been given much  the love of my family the faith and trust of the people of new york and the chance to lead this state i am deeply sorry that i did not live up to what was expected of me i have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my or any sense of right and wrong i apologize first and most importantly to my family i apologize to the public whom i promised better well one of the most important things for americans to be reminded of is that a lot of the exceptional nature of our country is founded in judeochristian values that promotes individualism personal responsibility a strong work ethic and a commitment to family charity im an actor im not a politician i always kick myself when i talk too much about family or personal things look ive got incredible pride for my family ive absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly there was a great complexity to my father he was a devoted family man but in the same breath he simply was not suited to an anchored life he should have been somebody who had a backpack an old map a bit of change in his pocket and that was it  roaming the world i can make dressing  or stuffing yall call it stuffing up here we call it dressing down there its really good dressing that family recipe was passed on and i love to make that if you feel rooted in your home and family if youre active in your community theres nothing more empowering the best way to make a difference in the world is to start by making a difference in your own life i text a lot people because its how i stay connected with all my family and friends when im on set and traveling my family belongs to a tennis club in valencia california so i always go there i play a lot of tennis with my dad and swim and i like to go to the gym there experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster and it showed me firsthand the importance of every family having access to good health care its very hard to make arguments about the effects of cloning on family relations if family relations are in tatters my family is from the south and i can remember all those ladies i grew up with like my greataunts who had handkerchiefs theres something sweet about them my kids are the future of the mayweather family and of the mayweather brand i feel our family is stronger if we stay together i have a really really really normal family and by normal i mean were all nuts on some level i think youve gotta be a little nuts to pursue any kind of creative job i was also a really good kid i know that sounds really dull but i didnt rebel in the traditional sense selfishness narcissism being uncomfortable in your own skin not feeling connected to the world around you feeling dislocated from family and youth having a strange relationship with your childhood  all those things feel really true to me i have a family the kitchen really is the castle itself this is where we spend our happiest moments and where we find the joy of being a family my humanitarian work evolved from being with my family my mom my dad they really set a great example for giving back my mom was a nurse my dad was a school teacher but my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people she would do home visits for free given my last position that i was the first us attorney post 911 in new jersey i understand acutely the pain and sorrow and upset of the family members who lost loved ones that day at the hands of radical muslim extremists and their sensitivities and concerns have to be taken into account it sounds cliche but success is your friends your family what you do and if youre happy when you wake up i think the hispanic community the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative they are faith family patriotism i contribute my best in my sport and i also have a ton of respect for myself and my family ones nativity is not of his own choosing but whatever it may be it is entitled to respect and all nations have honorable place in the worlds family fame is a lot of pressure especially when youre responsible for your entire family financially emotionally  everything i was the first person to go to university from my family you should be able to afford health care for your family you should be able to retire with dignity and respect and you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger go even farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine i know you care is really personal and fragile for me for me its about losing a family member and also about a breakup its about this idea of losing someone for good getting and keeping my immunity became very important to me for i needed to take care of myself and my family no one else was worried about me i was the black sheep of the family and my mother never really understood me of course i will continue to share my favorite southern recipes just like my mama grandmother and family shared with me over the years and now ill be adding a little bit of a lighter touch to some of these wonderful dishes what weve tried to do is have neighbors colleagues friends and family talking long before we understand ourselves through the process of selfexamination we understand ourselves in a selfevident way in the family society and state in which we live alzheimers parkinsons brain and spinal cord disorders diabetes cancer at least 58 diseases could potentially be cured through stem cell research diseases that touch every family in america and in the world when you go to the movies with your whole family its a different experience for some reason its something that youre all doing together and you take away something special in that i was the oldest of the children in my family i had to do a lot of diaperchanging and lunchmaking i was taking my little sister to ballet picking up my brother sort of being a supernanny and having a strong family you know weve lost some members of our family and had some setbacks but i think a good family and kids all those things i thought at one time you got to be kidding me those things are so important they enable you to go on well family is obviously the most important there was a time when i thought football was the most important in spite of reports about playing with various teams im enjoying retirement with my family and have no plans to play football i enjoy being busy i really do remember im the stub end of the railroad i have no family so im not taking busy time away from people that i should be spending it with so im just relaxing and enjoying it its a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year thats why its a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are im thinking of a legacy that i can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college so world domination  in terms of providing for my family  is absolutely my goal when i do get free time i spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and i think thats what keeps me happy healthy grounded and totally in check my rule is whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now because i dont like it when my family or close friends call me nicki minaj to me im not nicki minaj when im with them what i want to do is tell stories about normal people in the american suburbs i dont write the book where its a conspiracy reaching the prime minister i dont write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads my setting is a very placid pool of suburbia family life and within that i can make pretty big splashes a racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family frankly im fairly boring or fairly busy between writing and family i have little time for anything else if im not writing well im not happy if im not spending enough time with my family im not happy if im not connecting to friends or if i dont work out enough you get the point everything has to be balanced nothing should be an extreme i always wanted to be a farmer there is a tradition of that in my family the royal family to me are not england and they are not the flag my family although theyre very large on both my parents sides they dont know much about their family tree occasionally they try to dig but they cant get very far and its baffling in dublin it seems that so many public records were wiped out its proven to be very difficult so i know very little anyone that has a job that takes them away from home i think can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency not only with your family and those you love but with your friends im not sure why no one wants to admit theres a viable audience out there that believes in god and wants to see a movie with their family the demand is there the supply is not make space in your life for the things that matter for family and friends love and generosity fun and joy without this you will burn out in midcareer and wonder where your life went jews have deep respect for the queen and the royal family we say a prayer for them every sabbath in synagogue we recite a special blessing on seeing the queen whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy to try to do it by placing the entire burden on women  91 of singleparent families in britain are headed by the mother according to census data  is practically absurd and morally indefensible we do not always appreciate the role the queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years the transformation of britain into a multiethnic multifaith society no one does interfaith better than the royal family and it starts with the queen herself i grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world i worry because i dont think my kids are going to have that the world is very scary the world would be scary without the choices the current administration made but they just exacerbated it and it ticks me off i want my kids to have a good life no journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where i live i dont parade my family out for display which is the way it will stay ive always wanted to get into acting ever since i was younger id put on shows for my family and run around play dressup all the time i think i was 4 when i told them i wanted to do movies we fight a lot you know but thats family we may be dysfunctional but were still family i like all the families in the uk but what i like about the idea of the royal family is they seem like theyre well educated and theres something admirable about them and the queen she reminds me of my grandma im from a nice suburban middleclass family but my tattoos remind me where ive been if you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your familys life but change your ghettos life make your ghetto a good neighbourhood learn science try to be like mark zuckerberg bill gates and steve jobs if you live in a good neighborhood you drive home and theres a bank theres grocery stores and big houses  but no motels what that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house respectable means rich and decent means poor i should die if i heard my family called decent the countries who do the best in international comparisons whether its finland or japan denmark or singapore do well because they have professional teachers who are respected and they also have family and community which support learning the functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society but on behalf of personality my family moved a lot as a kid we started in colorado where i lived for five years we moved to chicago for two years to san francisco for one year connecticut for seven oregon for a couple years and then i went to school so i was always moving im still always moving there is a common theme though in the stories i have told which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle if im diagnosed with cancer i might become despondent but someone young might not and they might need connections with somebody outside their circle of family because their family is so despondent my family moved a lot as a kid we started in colorado where i lived for five years we moved to chicago for two years to san francisco for one year connecticut for seven oregon for a couple years and then i went to school because i didnt have brothers i was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family so i became one of them  but it was not my family according to the small business administration more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation and 8 percent do not make it to a third i wasnt looking to get into tv my family was in the movie business so i was never interested in that world the summer before i went to culinary school my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that i was making the right decision i think they hoped i would change my mind about culinary school my family truly believes they are better cooks than i am they see me as giada not as a celebrity chef to them im just me  their granddaughter niece etc and theyre older and wiser i like that because it keeps you grounded i want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the united states and has a family that comes i dont care if its a black family from jamaica or a hispanic family from mexico these issues need to be dealt with but they need to be dealt with in the entertaining way a plague on eminence i hardly dare cross the street anymore without a convoy and i am stared at wherever i go like an idiot member of a royal family or an animal in a zoo and zoo animals have been known to die from stares im a strange mixture of my mothers curiosity my father who grew up the son of the manse in a presbyterian family who had a tremendous sense of duty and responsibility and my mothers father who was always in trouble with gambling debts im considered homophobic and crazy about these things and old fashioned but i think that the family  father mother children  is fundamental to our civilisation id be a liar if i said i had a normal family i sometimes wonder if the tragedies my family has suffered are a kind of karmic price for all the fame and fortune the bee gees have had in a couple sometimes one or both people have to give up their personal life dreams and ambitions for the good of the family the financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high when im on my own i can be negative i need my friends and family around to help pick me up if ive had a bad qualifying session i think insecurity plagues a lot of sportspeople i do a lot of writing about my family by measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown i do not believe the picture that some people paint of scottish towns dependent on welfare every time i come here i meet people who are determined to get into work who with the right help are desperate to get off benefits support their family and set an example for their children getting a family into work supporting strong relationships getting parents off drugs and out of debt  all this can do more for a childs wellbeing than any amount of money in outofwork benefits choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people it was a way to choose a new family the extraordinary thing about india is that its such a family place its full of families everywhere god created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine i was lucky my family is wonderful and its funny because most of my best friends come from very large families so it always felt as if i had lots of siblings though in the end i had to leave them and go home i kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid because sorry to say women run the house they run the family they hold things up i mean its like you dont ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything and its kind of amazing i think to show people just how strong women are family is becoming more and more important to me you know most people they want to go to hollywood they want to be a star they want to be a rock star that thought never entered any of our minds the van halen family i love being healthy i get a lot of sleep im a girl who eats and i feel beautiful no matter how i look i have my family to thank for that the name van halen the family legacy is going to go on long after im gone im overjoyed and beyond honored to be a part of the loreal paris family im such a fan of loreal paris not just for all of their amazing products but for what they stand for the whole point of being in this business and being blessed and being successful is that youre able to do things for your friends or your family which means that they can have something special in their lives too i feel my familys needs are a priority im not comfortable with the idea of serving the many and ignoring my family it is from the progeny of this parent cell that we all take our looks we still share genes around and the resemblance of the enzymes of grasses to those of whales is in fact a family resemblance until he lost all his money my father was a successful north london jewish businessman he was unusual among his immediate family in that he was enormously cultured and had an incredible library i dont want to be reincarnated thats for sure when youve had rewarding experiences in your life  a loving family friends  you dont need additional reassurances that youre going to do something with a new cast of characters id just as soon pass wart hogs should sue for libel it is a terrible name and they are fine fellows and devoted family men and it is rare to see one by himself the little woman and the kiddies are usually close at hand you know you only get one family and you have to make it work its a family thats loaded with grudges and passion we come from a long line of robbers and highwaymen in italy you know killers even the voters are going to decide in november who is going to fix their personal family dismay over not having jobs in america they are going to pick mitt romney but in my heart of hearts this is the kind of thing this is what everyone is struggling with in their lives  relationships and family to me its always an interesting area to mine im drawn to it the uk needs a system for family migration underpinned by three simple principles one that those who come here should do so on the basis of a genuine relationship two that migrants should be able to pay their way and three that they are able to integrate into british society the sad events that occur in my life are the sad events that happen to everybody with losing friends and family but that is a natural occurrence as natural as being born i have lived in mumbai for more than 20 years have my domicile here my home and family here ive been through a lot of things in my personal and family life that turned me into a fighter i always strive to be the best i possibly can im lucky the best possible place in the world for training is addis ababa so i am home all the time except when i am racing i like to be there near my family my kids also the real estate business i run with my wife a company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company we dont isolate the family we dont make rides that say hey mom dad you go sit on the bench people just dont laugh when their family is violated and you dont shrug it off you band together and you defend together its a funny primitive instinct family traditions counter alienation and confusion they help us define who we are they provide something steady reliable and safe in a confusing world when i was very little we would get letters from china in chinese and they be censored we were a very insular little family if you want to have a good life you should focus on your family on your business on your dog on your fun and youll have a good life i dont have anything against my mom but my family has no emotional connection to each other i had no fun my family was too serious monarchists frequently declare that without the royal family britain would be nothing what a woeful lack of love for ones country such statements express it has to be real and i think a lot of the problems we have as a society is because we dont acknowledge that family is important and it has to be people who are present you know and mothers and fathers both are not present enough with children it was a source of shame for my family that i was in rock and roll which is so bluecollar it just isnt done and i felt it too what unites oklahomans today is what has always united us our unshakable faith our love of family and compassion for others the unlimited promise of a hopeful future playing guitar was one of my childhood hobbies and i had played a little at school and at camp my parents would drag me out to perform for my family like all parents do but it was a hobby  nothing more of course i regret not having been able to spend time with my family for our immediate family and relatives canada was a land of opportunity one wants to be together with ones family thats what families are about my family can always tell when im well into a novel because the meals get very crummy classical and romantic private language of a family quarrel a dead dispute over the distribution of emphasis between man and nature my mom was a professional my dad and mom met each other in a movie called new faces of 1937 my mom went under the name thelma leeds and she did a few movies and she was really a great singer and when she married my dad and started to have a family she sang at parties a person needs at intervals to separate himself from family and companions and go to new places he must go without his familiars in order to be open to influences to change some of the things you read you get an immediate reaction to so ive stopped reading things now i do worry about my family though some people do try some nasty things to get at them and try and get a reaction from them movies like that arent about the visual effects and explosions theyre human stories about family about life about death if i were to retire i would keep my familys interest in the company the same and say dont sell anybody who is running a marathon or doing a walkathon doing a fundraiser for their school their company by far its guaranteed the easiest and most fun way to quickly set up a fundraising campaign and send it around to your friends and family do not let your bachelor ways crystallize so that you cant soften them when you come to have a wife and a family of your own i have my family my children  i have a lot of outside activities i have a lovely family who supports me and its great i think and i mean this sincerely i was raised humbly we were a lower middle income family and a household that was scrimping by at times we were watching the dollar stretching the dollar and coupons it was all those things the dream was not to put one black family in the white house the dream was to make everything equal in everybodys house when i was a kid i took the brady bunch and the partridge family very seriously it was a world to me in the same way that the greek myths would have been had i read them you know marcia is athena and mr brady is zeus i grew up in a dysfunctional family im a republican i dont want to go to heaven and have to face my family up there and tell them i voted for a democrat but you know we have a very normal family weve had our ups and downs you know weve had our issues but weve had great cause for celebration the clan is nothing more than a larger family with its patriarchal chief as the natural head and the union of several clans by intermarriage and voluntary connection constitutes the tribe the best thing ive done with my money is buy a house for my family you wake up to a house you love and you feel like somebody even though i have a nice house nice family the rest of my generation is still in south central la my cousins my brothers my sisters they dont wanna move out they dont want to and they dont have the means to sustain it thats where my heart is and thats what i think about all the time south central is just who i am even though i have a nice house nice family the rest of my generation is still in south central la my cousins my brothers my sisters they dont wanna move out the warrior may fight for gold or for an immediate gain or for something to take home for the winter to feed the family the soldier is part of a more complex society hes fighting for a group ethic of some sort i went through a period of great rebellion within my family when i was about 9 or 10 i was mad i had no focus had no real interest in anything and so i started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid my fam is just a regular family but all of them have great senses of humor i remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the navy he didnt have to he was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism not just make movies about it i admired this about him my mom always said i was the peacemaker in the family my older brother eric was the leader the creative one i was just his puppet finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing ive ever done  by far when i heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of prince williams marriage i knew i had to give them a little something wet is the perfect anthem for prince william or any playa to get the club smokin it was only for two years and i jumped from family to family its very scary i had the good fortune of having a happy closely knit family i wish i had an extra day with my mom sometimes or another hour in the day with my family husband and children nashville is one of the greatest places for the best songwriters in the world its been fantastic to live there and to raise our family there its a great town i used to be a classic workaholic and after seeing how little work and career really mean when you reach the end of your life i put a new emphasis on things i believe count more these things include family friends being part of a community and appreciating the little joys of the average day i love christmas i really do love christmas i love being with my family and i love snow i love the music and the lights and all of it on the one hand the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me but on the other hand i long for it you know what i mean im constantly in conflict with things and it is because of my past and my upbringing and the journey that ive been on i like being in kids movies and i like being in family movies i dont believe in being mean to anyone im a really peaceful person thats something i get from my family im not a royal family watcher touring is tough youre almost in a haze because you dont really know where you are half the time youre in a hotel room one moment and the next thing you know youre onstage performing for 60000 people then youre back on an airplane its very hectic and i couldnt do it without my family when you have a family or even when youre just seeing a girl its difficult to be skint a fellow oughtnt to let his family property go to pieces for me family always comes first i would do anything to protect them my family went through divorces and remarriages and the later blended home  and then watched that home explode too there arent a lot of ironclad rules of family life but heres one no matter how much your parents deny it  and heres betting they deny it a lot  they have a favorite child and if youre a parent so do you spending 1 for a brand new house would feel very very good spending 1000 for a ham sandwich would feel very very bad spending 19000 for a small family car would feel well more or less right but as with physical pain fiscal pain can depend on the individual and everyone has a different threshold its one of the worstkept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere the favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it  the better to preserve the good thing theyve got going and to keep their siblings off their back theres a sort of sibling moratorium when youre establishing yourself as an adult so much of your energy has to be focused on other things like work and kids but when people become more settled siblings tend to regroup because now youre building a new extended family humans have a fraught relationship with beasts they are our companions and our chattel our family members and our laborers our household pets and our household pests we love them and cage them admire them and abuse them and of course we cook and eat them a close family member once offered his opinion that i exhibit the phone manners of a goat then promptly withdrew the charge  out of fairness to goats coming home to my family afterward makes the work richer easier and more fun equal pay isnt just a womens issue when women get equal pay their family incomes rise and the whole family benefits i grew up in a very oldfashioned roman catholic italianirish family in philly my family has very strong women my mother never laughed at my dream of africa even though everyone else did because we didnt have any money because africa was the dark continent and because i was a girl when i look back over my life its almost as if there was a plan laid out for me  from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to africa and whose family couldnt afford to put her through college everyone laughed at my dreams i was supposed to be a secretary in bournemouth you can be cool and at the same time respect your woman who will hopefully become your wife who will hopefully become the mother of your kids america needs to get back to family values im very excited about my new agreement with the heat this contract allows me to address all of my familys longterm financial goals while allowing the heat the ability to acquire those players that we need to win a championship for me its about the way i carry myself and the way i treat other people my relationship and how i feel about god and what he does for me is something deeply personal its where i came from my family i was brought up in a religious household and thats very important to me while i have felt lonely many times in my life the oddest feeling of all was after my mother lucille died my father had already died but i always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive it seems strange to say now that i felt so lonely yet i did i was always on the go and thought i was too busy to develop something like this i thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits but i was the last one in my family to eat junk food in my family in particular i think there was a sense we have to work twice as hard my mother isolated herself from all family and friends for some 20 years and never met her grandchild my son i grew up in a ukrainian catholicturnedchristian household and that is my familys faith we are a very crafty family i come from a massive family and the youngest is twentysomething years younger than i am so i grew up with children i have a very strong family i just want to have a great relationship with my child and have a great family dynamic as a child i had to get up early for school or work id get ready by myself id set my alarm to wake me up very early in the morning and be off to work the family driver driving me every morning i did it alone my parents never coming in to wake me up i need to work to support my family my dream maybe because of my family of course was to be a painter i chose in one moment the direction of textiles from textiles i went to fashion but for me i thought you made a record you got on a bus went out and played your shows and made a lot of money that was the way it was supposed to go down but theres a lot more to it than that there are a lot of early mornings late nights a lot of traveling a lot of being away from home being away from your family short of baseball and my family it was gaming and gaming is a 20million to 200million multiyear effort its an insane stupid and utterly irresponsible act but i did it i began to speak well at a very advanced age  15 16 17 years old it was psychological the trauma of war my family and growing up on my own i was more or less a street kid i am a universalist passionately devoted to the cause of equality within the human family i love seeing my family you dont have a family doctor anymore like you did when you were a kid who treated you throughout your life my father really was not the dominant person who raised the family it was my mother who raised the family i love film after a yummy meal for the whole family and some truly great friends we often go out to see something beautiful and unique as children we recognized that we belonged to an unusual even exceptional family but the effect was different on each of us the american people know whats necessary to get this economy moving again its fiscal discipline in washington dc and acrosstheboard tax relief for working families small businesses and family farms the royal family are not like you and me they live in houses so big that you can walk round all day and never need to meet your spouse the queen and prince philip have never shared a bedroom in their lives they dont even have breakfast together with the counseling of my family doctor my mother ended up turning to weight watchers and their childrens program i went to weekly meetings got counseling and would exercise with my peers who were my size it was the first time i saw a proper childrens portion size and it wasnt two burgers it was one i was the youngest of my entire family so you are tapdancing to try to get the attention of your older cousins i really hit my social stride in 6th grade but before that i was a pretty big dork you learn how to be amusing and how to work for it to me the kitchen is a place of adventure and entirely fun not drudgery i cant think of anything better to do with family and friends than to be together to create something i always loved family holidays and i had this vision and dream as a little girl of having a big family of my own i think with motherhood and childrearing in general everyones going to tell you how to do it and why ive always said to other mothers and women when theyve asked me that you have to find your own way and find out what works for your family at all costs although my family  parents and sister  all work in the personnel management business their real passion is performing amateur operatic societies and so on film is an illusion fame is ephemeral faith and family are what endure i think tattoos a song that can go so many different ways some people think of it as a breakup song but for me its about somebody who comes into your life and really touches you  be they a friend a family member or someone youre in a relationship with its cool to have parents and family who will always tell me the truth no matter what theyll tell me if im doing something stupid my family was all born in sicily and im italianamerican theyre the real thing theyre authentic italians and honestly theyre the most openminded nicest people in the world and nothing can really offend them thats the way i think true sicilians are i think when someone is injured in your family you want to speak to the individual and you want to hear their voice and you want to make sure they are ok growing up with my family gave me some of my best memories id like to have a family of my own  slip away for a bit and do nothing but spend those early years with my children im over the moon to be involved in the doctor who christmas special i cant quite believe it as its a part of the family tradition at the jenkins household i heard the news that i got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever you have no idea how humiliating it was as a boy to suddenly have all your clothes your toys snatched by the bailiff i mean we were a middleclass family its not as if it was happening up and down the street it made me ashamed i felt dirty i was quite able at the insignificant work i did in mi6 but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life i had no experience of fatherhood i had no example of marital bliss or the family unit i like playing music because its a good living and i get satisfaction from it but i cant feed my family with satisfaction baseball life is a tough life on the family i work six months and get three or four with the family i work six months and get three or four with the family ive stopped racing to get to the red light im very very concerned about the bush presidency im worried about the kinds of cuts in domestic programs that mean something to a lot of people including members of my family who depend on certain things from the government i have a lot of responsibilities outside myself i have a large family i want to know i can always be helpful my family makes these vinegars  out of everything from grapes to peaches and cherries we go through the whole process with the giant vat and drainer label them and give them as christmas presents we dont have the luxury of time we spend more because of how we live but its important to be with our family and friends i tend to show everything i do to my family to check they wont be offended when i was growing up in mississippi  it was good southern food but i also grew up with a greek family when other kids were eating fried okra we were eating steamed artichokes so i think it played a big part in my healthy cooking im just a publicschoolboy ive got a degree im from a middleclass family in devon ive got no story in my family we let our boys have a say in what veggie side they want for dinner that night we list off a handful of options and get them excited about helping to plan the dinner menu theyre much more inclined to finish their plates when theyve helped decide what goes on them to me money is the ability to create lifelong experiences for my family and myself to educate my children and a way to give back to humanity ive always been part of comedy one of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other particularly my two brothers and myself when my father was upset with something youd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh because when he didnt laugh you were in trouble ive been experimenting more and more with ln2 liquid nitrogen ive used it in battle on iron chef america but have also made some great ice creams at home for my family since it freezes basically on contact you can have ice cream ready in mere minutes my family brought me up to be very respectful of people when im home the heart and soul of our family is in the kitchen growing up my parents both worked so dinnertime was for family  the tv was off i think its important to grab that time and really make it special even after a tough day my parents did a great job raising me and my two sisters we all graduated from high school and we all graduated from college so to be a good representative of my family is probably my greatest accomplishment thus far i would like a foodlifestyle show were not sure what that is yet i want to be able to share what i do and how i raise my family i feel like i have a story to tell i enjoy talking and listening sharing ideas and sharing advice and whereas women had to fight to find their way into the workforce men are now fighting to reclaim their place in the family structure ive always known i wanted a family but i am armenian and i understand what it is to lose a country and lose a family and have massacres and genocides and everything against my people more than any other setting  more than battlefields or boardrooms or a spaceship headed for intergalactic travel  ill put my money on the family to provide an endless source of comedy tragedy and intrigue the importance of human life should be universally respected  and that refers to children before they are born and after all children have the right to be brought up in a loving twoparent family where the notion of divorce is not even possible while free choice vouchers didnt fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every american would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their familys health insurance costs freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under god is acknowledged for to be free is not merely to cast off ones chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others if you want total security go to prison there youre fed clothed given medical care and so on the only thing lacking is freedom i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do i am free no matter what rules surround me if i find them tolerable i tolerate them if i find them too obnoxious i break them i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err the desire of gold is not for gold it is for the means of freedom and benefit freedom is nothing but a chance to be better people demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use you have freedom when youre easy in your harness freedom is what you do with whats been done to you the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the goverment the truth is i love being alive and i love feeling free so if i cant have those things then i feel like a caged animal and id rather not be in a cage id rather be dead and its real simple and i think its not that uncommon we must be willing to pay a price for freedom liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people perfect freedom is as necessary to the health and vigor of commerce as it is to the health and vigor of citizenship real freedom is having nothing i was freer when i didnt have a cent is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish nothing else for in the end freedom is a personal and lonely battle and one faces down fears of today so that those of tomorrow might be engaged the only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it freedom is a mans natural power of doing what he pleases so far as he is not prevented by force or law i hope for nothing i fear nothing i am free as long as men are free to ask what they must free to say what they think free to think what they will freedom can never be lost and science can never regress freedom and justice cannot be parceled out in pieces to suit political convenience i dont believe you can stand for freedom for one group of people and deny it to others freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it there are two freedoms  the false where a man is free to do what he likes the true where he is free to do what he ought do not allow to slip away from you freedoms the people who came before you won with such hard knocks im a big advocate of freedom freedom of speech freedom of expression freedom of thought we will not waver we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail peace and freedom will prevail none who have always been free can understand the terrible fascinating power of the hope of freedom to those who are not free all theory is against freedom of the will all experience for it what is freedom of expression without the freedom to offend it ceases to exist may we think of freedom not as the right to do as we please but as the opportunity to do what is right freedom is the only law which genius knows you can only protect your liberties in this world by protecting the other mans freedom freedom is from within we are driven by five genetic needs survival love and belonging power freedom and fun freedom rings where opinions clash as human beings we are endowed with freedom of choice and we cannot shuffle off our responsibility upon the shoulders of god or nature we must shoulder it ourselves it is our responsibility our freedom can be measured by the number of things we can walk away from in america through pressure of conformity there is freedom of choice but nothing to choose from i believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy  but that could change enslave the liberty of but one human being and the liberties of the world are put in peril i believe in freedom of speech but i believe we should also have the right to comment on freedom of speech seek freedom and become captive of your desires seek discipline and find your liberty you cannot parcel out freedom in pieces because freedom is all or nothing freedom is the oxygen of the soul freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts were giving our freedoms away the american experiment was about freedom freedom to be stupid freedom to fail freedom to succeed children should have enough freedom to be themselves  once theyve learned the rules freedom from fear could be said to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend people heresy is another word for freedom of thought we do not commonly see in a tax a diminution of freedom and yet it clearly is one freedom is the recognition of necessity there is no such thing as a little freedom either you are all free or you are not free the right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedoms when we lose the right to be different we lose the privilege to be free i chose america as my home because i value freedom and democracy civil liberties and an open society freedom is contagious thats why despots fear it so much free speech carries with it some freedom to listen i need this wild life this freedom freedom is never easily won but once established freedom lasts spreads and chokes out tyranny freedom of the press is not an end in itself but a means to the end of achieving a free society coercion after all merely captures man freedom captivates him freedom is the right to ones dignity as a man human beings crave freedom at their core the link between my experience as an entrepreneur and that of a politician is all in one word freedom we should favor innovation and freedom over regulation the very idea of freedom incites fear in the hearts of terrorists across the world friends can help each other a true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself  and especially to feel or not feel whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them thats what real love amounts to  letting a person be what he really is change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle and so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom a man cant ride you unless your back is bent freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same a friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself expose yourself to your deepest fear after that fear has no power and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes you are free if the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed all the great things are simple and many can be expressed in a single word freedom justice honor duty mercy hope our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits between stimulus and response there is a space in that space is our power to choose our response in our response lies our growth and our freedom those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves the sweltering summer of the negros legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality the best road to progress is freedoms road freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being with freedom comes responsibility for the person who is unwilling to grow up the person who does not want to carry is own weight this is a frightening prospect the cost of freedom is always high but americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission israel was not created in order to disappear  israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom it is by the goodness of god that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things freedom of speech freedom of conscience and the prudence never to practice either of them today i choose life every morning when i wake up i can choose joy happiness negativity pain to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices  today i choose to feel life not to deny my humanity but embrace it freedom lies in being bold in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free  honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth the most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are you trade in your reality for a role you give up your ability to feel and in exchange put on a mask freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made china has to go along with world trends thats democracy liberty individual freedom china sooner or later has to go that way it cannot go backward punk is musical freedom its saying doing and playing what you want in websters terms nirvana means freedom from pain suffering and the external world and thats pretty close to my definition of punk rock it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom in the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger i do not shrink from this responsibility  i welcome it nobody can give you freedom nobody can give you equality or justice or anything if youre a man you take it freedom is never dear at any price it is the breath of life what would a man not pay for living most people do not really want freedom because freedom involves responsibility and most people are frightened of responsibility i am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars all we demanded was our right to twinkle violent means will give violent freedom that would be a menace to the world and to india herself the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are the cost of freedom is always high but americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission i am interested in anything about revolt disorder chaosespecially activity that seems to have no meaning it seems to me to be the road toward freedom rather than starting inside i start outside and reach the mental through the physical if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all i am a republican a black dyed in the wool republican and i never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress a hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom im interested in anything about revolt disorder chaos especially activity that appears to have no meaning it seems to me to be the road toward freedom we cannot expect that all nations will adopt like systems for conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth i believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength americans are so enamored of equality that they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom every human has four endowments self awareness conscience independent will and creative imagination these give us the ultimate human freedom the power to choose to respond to change it is cruel you know that music should be so beautiful it has the beauty of loneliness of pain of strength and freedom the beauty of disappointment and neversatisfied love the cruel beauty of nature and everlasting beauty of monotony the revelation of thought takes men out of servitude into freedom freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose anything less is a form of slavery what is ominous is the ease with which some people go from saying that they dont like something to saying that the government should forbid it when you go down that road dont expect freedom to survive very long money wont create success the freedom to make it will well if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part to us do they i think my first album opened a lot of doors for me to push the freedom of speech to the limit nothing has been purchased more dearly than the little bit of reason and sense of freedom which now constitutes our pride responsibility is the price of freedom a free press can of course be good or bad but most certainly without freedom the press will never be anything but bad a free america means just this individual freedom for all rich or poor or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it let freedom reign the sun never set on so glorious a human achievement the framers of our constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion not freedom from religion communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom because the shortterm objects of communism would always correspond with the longterm objects of freedom movements if society fits you comfortably enough you call it freedom the only certain freedoms in departure i am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the american way of life is freedom limited government and minding our own business overseas where globalization means as it so often does that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom without freedom no art art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself and dies of all others i think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom every tyrant who has lived has believed in freedom for himself religious liberty is the first freedom in our constitution and whether the cause is justice for the persecuted compassion for the needy and the sick or mercy for the child waiting to be born there is no greater force for good in the nation than christian conscience in action i believe in a religion that believes in freedom any time i have to accept a religion that wont let me fight a battle for my people i say to hell with that religion without culture and the relative freedom it implies society even when perfect is but a jungle this is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future men are never really willing to die except for the sake of freedom therefore they do not believe in dying completely only free men can negotiate prisoners cannot enter into contracts your freedom and mine cannot be separated there is no such thing as part freedom we the people recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks whats in it for me a freedom without a commitment to others a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense freedom from effort in the present merely means that there has been effort stored up in the past you can have peace or you can have freedom dont ever count on having both at once i live in america i have the right to write whatever i want and its equaled by another right just as powerful the right not to read it freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend people the liberties of our country the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending against all hazards and it is our duty to defend them against all attacks our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual grace is the beauty of form under the influence of freedom freedom consists not in doing what we like but in having the right to do what we ought this is the highest wisdom that i own freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew books were my pass to personal freedom i learned to read at age three and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in mississippi if youre not ready to die for it put the word freedom out of your vocabulary when freedom does not have a purpose when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women when it does not listen to the voice of conscience it turns against humanity and society there is only one kind of freedom and thats individual liberty our lives come from our creator and our liberty comes from our creator it has nothing to do with government granting it i was ecstatic they renamed french fries as freedom fries grown men and women in positions of power in the us government showing themselves as idiots if we wish to free ourselves from enslavement we must choose freedom and the responsibility this entails i wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom how absurd men are they never use the liberties they have they demand those they do not have they have freedom of thought they demand freedom of speech for more than four decades the libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant  moammar gaddafi he has denied his people freedom exploited their wealth murdered opponents at home and abroad and terrorized innocent people around the world  including americans who were killed by libyan agents you cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom the fight for freedom must go on until it is won until our country is free and happy and peaceful as part of the community of man we cannot rest those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must like men undergo the fatigue of supporting it love does not claim possession but gives freedom necessity is blind until it becomes conscious freedom is the consciousness of necessity we believe in individual initiative personal responsibility opportunity freedom small government the constitution these principles these american principles are key to getting our economy back to being successful and leading the world he only earns his freedom and his life who takes them every day by storm freedom isnt free it shouldnt be a bragging point that oh i dont get involved in politics as if that makes someone cleaner no that makes you derelict of duty in a republic liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didnt insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable our plans protect freedom and opportunity and our blueprint is the constitution of the united states freedom has cost too much blood and agony to be relinquished at the cheap price of rhetoric if i am elected president of these united states i will work with all my energy and soul to restore that america to lift our eyes to a better future that future is our destiny that future is out there it is waiting for us our children deserve it our nation depends upon it the peace and freedom of the world require it a big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the whatifs of life whenever men take the law into their own hands the loser is the law and when the law loses freedom languishes to say that any people are not fit for freedom is to make poverty their choice and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not there are necessary evils money is an important thing in terms of representing freedom in our world and now i have a daughter to think about its really the first time ive thought about the future and what it could be posterity you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom i hope you will make good use of it perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government but from the beginning this nation trusted in god not man religious liberty is the first freedom in our constitution ultimately americas answer to the intolerant man is diversity the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired religious freedom opens a door for americans that is closed to too many others around the world but whether we walk through that door and what we do with our lives after we do is up to us freedom freedom of religion freedom to speak their mind freedom to build a life and yes freedom to build a business with their own hands this is the essence of the american experience history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid anxiety is the dizziness of freedom you dont have freedom because you are a hyphenated american you have freedom because you are an individual and that should be protected we can be thankful to a friend for a few acres or a little money and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth and for the great benefits of our being our life health and reason we look upon ourselves as under no obligation a man may be a pessimistic determinist before lunch and an optimistic believer in the wills freedom after it they wont break me because the desire for freedom and the freedom of the irish people is in my heart the day will dawn when all the people of ireland will have the desire for freedom to show it is then that we will see the rising of the moon and let me make this very clear  unlike president obama i will not raise taxes on the middle class as president i will protect the sanctity of life i will honor the institution of marriage and i will guarantee americas first liberty the freedom of religion we still believe in the america that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom we believe in the america that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves since castro took power the cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms no freedom of religion no freedom of the press no political freedom and the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will your true traveller finds boredom rather agreeable than painful it is the symbol of his liberty  his excessive freedom he accepts his boredom when it comes not merely philosophically but almost with pleasure every friend of freedom must be as revolted as i am by the prospect of turning the united states into an armed camp by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence we are faced with the paradoxical fact that education has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of thought back a hundred years ago especially around woodrow wilson what happened in this country is we took freedom and we chopped it into pieces when one makes a revolution one cannot mark time one must always go forward  or go back he who now talks about the freedom of the press goes backward and halts our headlong course towards socialism pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the muslim ideology which has to be preserved which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which we hope other will share with us the words spoken by the leader of the free world can expand the frontiers of freedom or shrink them when ronald reagan called on gorbachev to tear down this wall a surge of confidence rose that would ultimately breach the bounds of the evil empire make no mistake in this campaign i will offer the american ideals of economic freedom a clear and unapologetic defense president obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience i will defend religious liberty and overturn regulations that trample on our first freedom i dont want to transform america i want to restore to america the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world the secret of freedom lies in educating people whereas the secret of tyranny is in keeping them ignorant there are 4 billion cell phones in use today many of them are in the hands of market vendors rickshaw drivers and others whove historically lacked access to education and opportunity information networks have become a great leveler and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want the worst enemy of life freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy their second worst enemy is total efficiency those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground i believe all americans who believe in freedom tolerance and human rights have a responsibility to oppose bigotry and prejudice based on sexual orientation there can be no real freedom without the freedom to fail freedom in art freedom in society this is the double goal towards which all consistent and logical minds must strive the only way that has ever been discovered to have a lot of people cooperate together voluntarily is through the free market and thats why its so essential to preserving individual freedom no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare when people talk of the freedom of writing speaking or thinking i cannot choose but laugh no such thing ever existed no such thing now exists but i hope it will exist but it must be hundreds of years after you and i shall write and speak no more freedom is hammered out on the anvil of discussion dissent and debate be strong believe in freedom and in god love yourself understand your sexuality have a sense of humor masturbate dont judge people by their religion color or sexual habits love life and your family the more decisions that you are forced to make alone the more you are aware of your freedom to choose freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four if that is granted all else follows you dont have to be a man to fight for freedom all you have to do is to be an intelligent human being emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem there is nothing wrong with america that faith love of freedom intelligence and energy of her citizens cannot cure i know but one freedom and that is the freedom of the mind freedom is not something that one people can bestow on another as a gift thy claim it as their own and none can keep it from them analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible but to give the patients ego freedom to decide one way or another pervading nationalism imposes its dominion on man today in many different forms and with an aggressiveness that spares no one the challenge that is already with us is the temptation to accept as true freedom what in reality is only a new form of slavery a major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that group thinks they ought to want underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself freedom is the most contagious virus known to man freedom in general may be defined as the absence of obstacles to the realization of desires shall i tell you what the real evil is to cringe to the things that are called evils to surrender to them our freedom in defiance of which we ought to face any suffering freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient greek republics freedom for slave owners fear is not in the habit of speaking truth when perfect sincerity is expected perfect freedom must be allowed nor has anyone who is apt to be angry when he hears the truth any cause to wonder that he does not hear it freedom of opinion can only exist when the government thinks itself secure both the american people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom if a nation values anything more than freedom it will lose its freedom and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more it will lose that too we gain freedom when we have paid the full price i know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion as in america perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose ones government is not necessarily to secure freedom the family is the test of freedom because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired but by controlling the desire freedom means the right of people to assemble organize and debate openly what then is freedom the power to live as one wishes freedom is a possession of inestimable value freedom is the right to live as we wish if there is any principle of the constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate freedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free how often i have found that we grow to maturity not by doing what we like but by doing what we should how true it is that not every should is a compulsion and not every like is a high morality and true freedom just living is not enough one must have sunshine freedom and a little flower freedom  to walk free and own no superior forgiveness is the key to action and freedom underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward and freedom will be defended history has taught us over and over again that freedom is not free when push comes to shove the ultimate protectors of freedom and liberty are the brave men and women in our armed forces throughout our history theyve answered the call in bravery and sacrifice the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the states of created beings capable of law where there is no law there is no freedom everywhere that freedom stirs let tyrants fear history suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom clearly it is not a sufficient condition a filmmaker has almost the same freedom as a novelist has when he buys himself some paper in this possibly terminal phase of human existence democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued  they may be essential to survival the greatest threat to freedom is the absence of criticism when there is state there can be no freedom but when there is freedom there will be no state we seek peace knowing that peace is the climate of freedom governments that block the aspirations of their people that steal or are corrupt that oppress and torture or that deny freedom of expression and human rights should bear in mind that they will find it increasingly hard to escape the judgement of their own people or where warranted the reach of international law we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home americans admire a people who can scratch a desert and produce a garden the israelis have shown qualities that americans identify with guts patriotism idealism a passion for freedom i have seen it i know i believe that any nation that thinks more of its ease and comfort than its freedom will soon lose its freedom and the ironical thing about it is that it will lose its ease and comfort too i begin to feel like most americans dont understand the first amendment dont understand the idea of freedom of speech and dont understand that its the responsibility of the citizen to speak out the secret to happiness is freedom and the secret to freedom is courage liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security the intense happiness of our union is derived in a high degree from the perfect freedom with which we each follow and declare our own impressions human beings the world over need freedom and security that they may be able to realize their full potential i stand for freedom of expression doing what you believe in and going after your dreams i come bearing an olive branch in one hand and the freedom fighters gun in the other do not let the olive branch fall from my hand who is more to be pitied a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say personal identity seems like its just such an american archetype from holly golightly reinventing herself in breakfast at tiffanys to jay gatsby in the great gatsby it seems like the sort of archetypal american issue if youre given the freedom to be anything or be anyone what do you do with it satisfaction consists in freedom from pain which is the positive element of life a just laicism allows religious freedom the state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society as soon as laws are necessary for men they are no longer fit for freedom power in defense of freedom is greater than power in behalf of tyranny and oppression one of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians but the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources like artists because art and music allow people a certain freedom no protracted war can fail to endanger the freedom of a democratic country i keep telling myself to calm down to take less of an interest in things and not to get so excited but i still care a lot about liberty freedom of speech and expression and fairness in journalism the success i have achieved in bodybuilding motion pictures and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the american people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams we are willing enough to praise freedom when she is safely tucked away in the past and cannot be a nuisance in the present amidst dangers whose outcome we cannot foresee we get nervous about her and admit censorship we have convinced over one billion members of the islamic faith that we are prejudiced against their religion that we would deny them freedom of religion that we want suppress their culture and invade their governments 137 years later memorial day remains one of americas most cherished patriotic observances the spirit of this day has not changed  it remains a day to honor those who died defending our freedom and democracy freedom does not come without a price we may sometimes take for granted the many liberties we enjoy in america but they have all been earned through the ultimate sacrifice paid by so many of the members of our armed forces to become selfaware people must be allowed to hear a plurality of opinions and then make up their own minds they must be allowed to say write and publish whatever they want freedom of expression is the most basic but fundamental right without it human beings are reduced to automatons freedom is a right ultimately defended by the sacrifice of americas servicemen and women there are days when solitude is a heady wine that intoxicates you with freedom others when it is a bitter tonic and still others when it is a poison that makes you beat your head against the wall i had crossed the line i was free but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom i was a stranger in a strange land no amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses a buddha is someone who finds freedom in good fortune and bad before anything else we need a new age of enlightenment our present political systems must relinquish their claims on truth justice and freedom and have to replace them with the search for truth justice freedom and reason the course of this conflict is not known yet its outcome is certain freedom and fear justice and cruelty have always been at war and we know that god is not neutral between them my desire to curtail undue freedom of speech extends only to such public areas as restaurants airports streets hotel lobbies parks and department stores verbal exchanges between consenting adults in private are as of little interest to me as they probably are to them the hope and change the democrats had in mind was nothing more than a retread of the failed and discredited socialist policies that have been the enemy of freedom for centuries all over the world i fear america is teetering towards tyranny i am a lover of truth a worshipper of freedom a celebrant at the altar of language and purity and tolerance a state that suppresses all freedom of speech and which by imposing the most terrible punishments treats each and every attempt at criticism however morally justified and every suggestion for improvement as plotting to high treason is a state that breaks an unwritten law unnecessary possessions are unnecessary burdens if you have them you have to take care of them there is great freedom in simplicity of living it is those who have enough but not too much who are the happiest so long as you do not achieve social liberty whatever freedom is provided by the law is of no avail to you you measure a democracy by the freedom it gives its dissidents not the freedom it gives its assimilated conformists freedom and order are not incompatible truth is strength free discussion is the very life of truth in my youth i stressed freedom and in my old age i stress order i have made the great discovery that liberty is a product of order americas greatness has been the greatness of a free people who shared certain moral commitments freedom without moral commitment is aimless and promptly selfdestructive america is a model of force and freedom and moderation  with all the coarseness and rudeness of its people the wisest use of american strength is to advance freedom freedom would be not to choose between black and white but to abjure such prescribed choices punk has always been about doing things your own way what it represents for me is ultimate freedom and a sense of individuality i love music its freedom a way to deal with pentup frustration for us democracy is a question of human dignity and human dignity is political freedom only people who have been allowed to practise freedom can have the grownup look in their eyes the united nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members no slavery can be abolished without a double emancipation and the master will benefit by freedom more than the freedman the only freedom i care about is the freedom to do right the freedom to do wrong i am ready to part with on the cheapest terms to anyone who will take it of me justice is never given it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final fact but a continuing evolving process to higher and higher levels of human social economic political and religious relationship while the state exists there can be no freedom when there is freedom there will be no state even before i knew i was gay i knew i didnt want to have a child i knew i didnt want to have one i never want to have to release it from me listen i love babies i love children and i melt when im around them i also love my freedom and i love that i can sleep at night fiction is such a world of freedom its wonderful if you want someone to fly they can fly if one more journalist makes a cavalier statement about me and my band i will personally or with my fans help greet them at their home and discover just how much they believe in their freedom of speech we will not be intimidated or pushed off the world stage by people who do not like what we stand for and that is freedom democracy and the fight against disease poverty and terrorism just living is not enough one must have sunshine freedom and a little flower the freedom to fail is vital if youre going to succeed most successful people fail from time to time and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success i believe that god has planted in every heart the desire to live in freedom american and israel share a special bond our relationship is unique among all nations like america israel is a strong democracy a symbol of freedom and an oasis of liberty a home to the oppressed and persecuted all people hope islam helps everything in life islam will make jobs islam will make freedom islam will make everything there are two good things in life  freedom of thought and freedom of action as we look forward to freedom the shining city on the hill and the best days of america lying ahead it is the men and women in uniform who protect defend and make us proud to whom we should look and give thanks every night to be able to love and live in freedom means to be able to make godly decisions to make godly decisions we have to surrender our egos and all the falsity and shame that goes with it the momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable  and it is not carried forward by our power alone we can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years and in all that is to come we can know that his purposes are just and true freedom of speech freedom of the press and freedom of religion all have a double aspect  freedom of thought and freedom of action anywhere anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose the choice is the same freedom not tyranny democracy not dictatorship the rule of law not the rule of the secret police much literary criticism comes from people for whom extreme specialization is a cover for either grave cerebral inadequacy or terminal laziness the latter being a much cherished aspect of academic freedom you cant put democracy and freedom back into a box how does the meadow flower its bloom unfold because the lovely little flower is free down to its root and in that freedom bold freedom of speech is always under attack by fascist mentality which exists in all parts of the world unfortunately racism is a refuge for the ignorant it seeks to divide and to destroy it is the enemy of freedom and deserves to be met headon and stamped out struggle is a never ending process freedom is never really won you earn it and win it in every generation education is a human right with immense power to transform on its foundation rest the cornerstones of freedom democracy and sustainable human development true freedom is where an individuals thoughts and actions are in alignment with that which is true correct and of honor  no matter the personal price to enjoy freedom we have to control ourselves men who want to support women in our struggle for freedom and justice should understand that it is not terrifically important to us that they learn to cry it is important to us that they stop the crimes of violence against us novelists have always had complete freedom to pretty much tell their story any way they saw fit and thats what im trying to do our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the hebrew prophets america and israel have a common love of human freedom and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life a political prisoner is someone who is out fighting for his or her peoples rights and freedom and is imprisoned for that alone todays constitution is a realistic document of freedom only because of several corrective amendments those amendments speak to a sense of decency and fairness that i and other blacks cherish true independence and freedom can only exist in doing whats right i am conservative with a small c its possible to be conservative in fiscal policy and tolerant on moral issues or questions of freedom of expression freedom granted only when it is known beforehand that its effects will be beneficial is not freedom analysis gave me great freedom of emotions and fantastic confidence i felt i had served my time as a puppet in south africa we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world who through the use of nonviolent means such as boycotts and divestment encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decadeslong support for the apartheid regime pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as ends look freedom is an overwhelming american notion the idea that we want to see the world the peoples of the world free is something that all of us subscribe to we must face the fact that the preservation of individual freedom is incompatible with a full satisfaction of our views of distributive justice thought takes man out of servitude into freedom art gives me the freedom i dont have when i make music for all who love freedom and peace the world without saddam husseins regime is a better and safer place the terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear  and they should be afraid because freedom is on the march the road to freedom lies not through mysteries or occult performances but through the intelligent use of natural forces and laws the price of freedom is eternal vigilance freedom is not enough freedom and democracy are dreams you never give up all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues freedom people demand freedom only when they have no power freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one let a new earth rise let another world be born let a bloody peace be written in the sky let a second generation full of courage issue forth let a people loving freedom come to growth the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins the killers will fail and the iraqi people will live in freedom i do not want art for a few any more than education for a few or freedom for a few i am truly free only when all human beings men and women are equally free the freedom of other men far from negating or limiting my freedom is on the contrary its necessary premise and confirmation death is the liberator of him whom freedom cannot release the physician of him whom medicine cannot cure and the comforter of him whom time cannot console bondage is of the mind freedom too is of the mind if you say i am a free soul i am a son of god who can bind me free you shall be those religions that are oppressive to women are also against democracy human rights and freedom of expression real freedom lies in wildness not in civilization the fifth freedom is freedom from ignorance the liberals think government exists to fix whats wrong with america they find fault with our constitution our economic model and our core values we disagree with the premise of their argument we believe theres nothing wrong with america that an extra dose of freedom wont cure freedom of expression  in particular freedom of the press  guarantees popular participation in the decisions and actions of government and popular participation is the essence of our democracy men are freest when they are most unconscious of freedom the shout is a rattling of chains always was it is capitalist america that produced the modern independent woman never in history have women had more freedom of choice in regard to dress behavior career and sexual orientation that freedom can never be attained by a nation without suffering and sacrifice has been amply borne out by the recent tragic happenings in this subcontinent exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity freedom is control in your own life i was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom they have the gratification of intense interest the authorities want to put them in jail while there are younger readers for whom what they write is pure oxygen i have no choice about whether or not i have parkinsons i have nothing but choices about how i react to it in those choices theres freedom to do a lot of things in areas that i wouldnt have otherwise found myself in we cant equate democracy with christianity because the largest democracy on earth is india which is primarily hindu the third largest democracy is indonesia which is islamic democracy and freedom are not dependent on christian beliefs none can love freedom heartily but good men the rest love not freedom but licence freedom can occur only through education fashion is an imposition a reign on freedom economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence and what do democrats stand for if they are so ready to defame concerned citizens as the mob  a word betraying a marie antoinette delusion of superiority to ordinary mortals i thought my party was populist attentive to the needs and wishes of those outside the power structure and as a product of the 1960s i thought the democratic party was passionately committed to freedom of thought and speech it is better to lose everything you have to keep the balance of justice level than to live a life of petty privilege devoid of true freedom a new breeze is blowing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn for in mans heart if not in fact the day of the dictator is over the totalitarian era is passing its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree art is the daughter of freedom young players need freedom of expression to develop as creative players they should be encouraged to try skills without fear of failure the perfection of our union especially our commitment to equality of opportunity has been a story of constant striving to live up to our founding principles this is what abraham lincoln meant when he said in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free  honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve thats what we do in this country thats the american dream thats freedom and ill take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners i dont like definitions but if there is a definition of freedom it would be when you have control over your reality to transform it to change it rather than having it imposed upon you you cant really ask for more than god tolerates even our stammering and pardons our ignorance whenever something inadvertently escapes us  as indeed without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray a nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten when youre not concerned with succeeding you can work with complete freedom secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of watching president obama apologize last week for americas arrogance  before a french audience that owes its freedom to the sacrifices of americans  helped convince me that he has a deepseated antipathy toward american values and traditions art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith faith and freedom if the events of september 11 2001 have proven anything its that the terrorists can attack us but they cant take away what makes us american  our freedom our liberty our civil rights no only attorney general john ashcroft can do that our culture is just a series of checks and balances the whole idea that were in a battle between tyranny and freedom  its a series of pendulum swings but if you can create an honorable livelihood where you take your skills and use them and you earn a living from it it gives you a sense of freedom and allows you to balance your life the way you want but i dont think any arranger should ever write a drum part for a drummer because if a drummer cant create his own interpretation of the chart and he plays everything thats written he becomes mechanical he has no freedom the degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of concentration on a single thought are the measures to gauge spiritual progress freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently back then i didnt think a woman like that or a relationship like that could exist with complete freedom and no jealousy or possessiveness i thought it sounded too good to be true and i was certainly convinced it wasnt the life for me i think this society suffers so much from too much freedom too many rights that allow people to be irresponsible but i found that disappointing people is a good thing because disapproval is freedom it is easy to believe in freedom of speech for those with whom we agree america to me is freedom the new freedom of expression brought by the internet goes far beyond politics people relate to each other in new ways posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception the man form is higher than the angel form of all forms it is the highest man is the highest being in creation because he aspires to freedom what is the conservative movement its pretty straightforward we believe that the way prosperity is created is when people have the freedom and the opportunity to pursue their dreams many politicians are in the habit of laying it down as a selfevident proposition that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom the maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim heres a nation one of the founding pillars was freedom of speech and freedom of expression and yet we have imposed upon people restrictions on what they can say on what they can think and the media is the largest proponent of this crucifying people who say things really quite innocently you cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom the history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be freedom is fragile and must be protected to sacrifice it even as a temporary measure is to betray it no one can enjoy freedom without trembling im not sure if its good to have freedom or not im really confused now freedom is not a gift nor does it simply exist for us to have but rather it is a sacred duty and its blessed yield of hope is born from none other than the blood of the innocent obedience is detachment from the self this is the most radical detachment of all but what is the self the self is the principle of reason and responsibility in us it is the root of freedom it is what makes us men what is the essence of america finding and maintaining that perfect delicate balance between freedom to and freedom from the precondition to freedom is security the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation ive used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the united states as effectively as possible and secondly ive still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth but on average i go to the gym about four or five times a week today im so experienced in training  im actually listening to my body now my body needs freedom when i train i create serenity and i produce oxygen in my blood it helps me to think better and relax by training you accentuate the problem we dont appreciate what we have until its gone freedom is like that its like air when you have it you dont notice it there should be a sympathy with freedom a desire to give it scope founded not upon visionary ideas but upon the long experience of many generations within the shores of this happy isle that in freedom you lay the firmest foundations both of loyalty and order a mere forty years ago beach volleyball was just beginning no bureaucrat would have invented it and thats what freedom is all about no cause is left but the most ancient of all the one in fact that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics the cause of freedom versus tyranny victorious living does not mean freedom from temptation nor does it mean freedom from mistakes to me freedom entitles you to do something not to not do something a person is a fool to become a writer his only compensation is absolute freedom and why do we who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech allow people to go to prison and be vilified and magazines to be closed down on the spot for suggesting another version of history the jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world across the centuries passover has never lost its power to inspire the imagination of successive generations of jews with its annually reenacted drama of slavery and liberation dont ever dare to take your college as a matter of course  because like democracy and freedom many people youll never know have broken their hearts to get it for you the freedom to be an individual is the essence of america as a consequence of the victories we have registered during our first ten years of freedom we have laid a firm foundation for the new advances we must and will make during the next decade ive returned to being an amateur without any ties or strings attached which gives me a freedom i never had before in many respects the united states is a great country freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country it is also a very free society working with hbo was an opportunity to experience creative freedom and longform development that filmmakers didnt have a chance to do before the emergence of shows like the sopranos freedom morality and the human dignity of the individual consists precisely in this that he does good not because he is forced to do so but because he freely conceives it wants it and loves it in a completely sane world madness is the only freedom i felt extremely uncomfortable as the focal point in the spotlight i really like the behind the scenes role because all my freedom is there the general interest of the masses might take the place of the insight of genius if it were allowed freedom of action when we talk of freedom and opportunity for all nations the mocking paradoxes in our own society become so clear they can no longer be ignored for you who no longer posses it freedom is everything for us who do it is merely an illusion negation is the minds first freedom yet a negative habit is fruitful only so long as we exert ourselves to overcome it adapt it to our needs once acquired it can imprison us we chose more freedom instead of more government we chose the principles of our founding to solve the challenges of our time we chose a special man to lead us in a special time we chose mitt romney to lead our nation i think theres some connection between absolute discipline and absolute freedom in 1960 when i came out of prison as an exconvict i had more freedom under parolee supervision than theres available in america right now it is very easy to make clear what you want a film to say but i did not wish to engage in overt propaganda even for the right cause i wanted to create an experience through the films something where people could have the freedom of their own response to them among the many values in life i appreciate freedom most it is clear that not in one thing alone but in many ways equality and freedom of speech are a good thing and its one thing to give people freedom and something else to deny the rights of christians to assert their faith in order to keep hindus from feeling upset the day will dawn when all the people of ireland will have the desire for freedom to show it is then well see the rising of the moon not to sound overly cheesy but i really appreciate the freedom we have in america  especially as a female the political core of any movement for freedom in the society has to have the political imperative to protect free speech among the best traitors ireland has ever had mother church ranks at the very top a massive obstacle in the path to equality and freedom she has been a force for conservatism to ward off threats to her own security and influence it requires greater courage to preserve inner freedom to move on in ones inward journey into new realms than to stand defiantly for outer freedom it is often easier to play the martyr as it is to be rash in battle no people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies we are living in the excesses of freedom just take a look at 42nd street and broadway civilization is the order and freedom is promoting cultural activity every therapeutic cure and still more any awkward attempt to show the patient the truth tears him from the cradle of his freedom from responsibility and must therefore reckon with the most vehement resistance in health there is freedom health is the first of all liberties old age calm expanded broad with the haughty breadth of the universe old age flowing free with the delicious nearby freedom of death once i know people know who i am it gives me a lot of licence and freedom to behave in ways i wouldnt normally but it wasnt until i graduated from texas a amp m university and joined the united states air force flying c130s all around the globe that i truly appreciated the blessings of freedom im not a drug addict my wild period wasnt about drugs it was about sexual freedom the state is the altar of political freedom and like the religious altar it is maintained for the purpose of human sacrifice as long as there is rape there is not going to be any peace or justice or equality or freedom you are not going to become what you want to become or who you want to become you are not going to live in the world you want to live in theres a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling youre selfpropelled and decide exactly where to go if you see something that catches your eye to the left you can veer off there which isnt so easy in a car and you cant cover as much ground walking the magic of america is that were a free and open society with a mixed population part of our security is our freedom the idea that men are created free and equal is both true and misleading men are created different they lose their social freedom and their individual autonomy in seeking to become like each other it was so much fun to have the freedom to wander america with no assignments for 25 or 30 years i never had an assignment these were all stories i wanted to do myself freedom cannot be given it can only be taken away i had spent many years pursuing excellence because that is what classical music is all about now it was dedicated to freedom and that was far more important there are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about god and religion but does anybody really know for sure thats why the founding fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves true freedom requires the rule of law and justice and a judicial system in which the rights of some are not secured by the denial of rights to others but if people want to swim in the thames if they want to take their lives into their own hands then they should be able to do so with all the freedom and exhilaration of our woadpainted ancestors we in the united states should be all the more thankful for the freedom and religious tolerance we enjoy and we should always remember the lessons learned from the holocaust in hopes we stay vigilant against such inhumanity now and in the future a nice easy place for freedom of speech to be eroded is comics because comics are a natural target whenever an election comes up the current total of countries in the world with first amendments is one you have guaranteed freedom of speech other countries dont have that we know there is no such thing as freedom without the risk of failure fortunately somewhere between chance and mystery lies imagination the only thing that protects our freedom despite the fact that people keep trying to reduce it or kill it off altogether we need the children of indonesia and the philippines to manufacture our freedom of choice and we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves when we have a government that honors our constitution and stands up for the values that have made america america economic freedom individual liberty and personal responsibility hamas is a terrorist organization dedicated to annihilating the jewish state it runs a theocratic totalitarian state in gaza with no individual liberty and no freedom of speech or press we know what works freedom works we know whats right freedom is right to me the american dream is being able to follow your own personal calling to be able to do what you want to do is incredible freedom i can remember when democrats believed that it was the duty of america to fight for freedom over tyranny the cause of freedom is not the cause of a race or a sect a party or a classit is the cause of human kind the very birthright of humanity we call our country home of the brave and land of the free but its not we give a false portrayal of freedom were not free  if we were wed allow people their freedom the clash of ideas is the sound of freedom a lot of people out there pay good lip service to the idea of personal freedom right up to the point that someone tries to do something that they dont personally approve of the ego is partly free partly determined and reaches fuller freedom by approaching the individual who is most free god man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity true human goodness in all its purity and freedom can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power heroworship is strongest where there is least regard for human freedom america is just the country that how all the written guarantees in the world for freedom are no protection against tyranny and oppression of the worst kind there the politician has come to be looked upon as the very scum of society what we have at present is a system of loss socialism whatever goes wrong is shouldered by the general public and anything that works is privatised worshippers of market freedom have suspended the most important economic principle risk and liability go hand in hand in the literal sense there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from africa but there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights justice and freedom  along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society political freedom without economic equality is a pretense a fraud a lie and the workers want no lying what churchill described as the twin marauders of war and tyranny have been almost entirely banished from our continent today hundreds of millions dwell in freedom from the baltic to the adriatic from the western approaches to the aegean today hundreds of millions dwell in freedom from the baltic to the adriatic from the western approaches to the aegean and while we must never take this for granted the first purpose of the european union  to secure peace  has been achieved and we should pay tribute to all those in the eu alongside nato who made that happen the enemies of freedom do not argue they shout and they shoot it is the people who scream the loudest about america and freedom who see to be the most intolerant for a differing point of view to me punk rock is the freedom to create freedom to be successful freedom to not be successful freedom to be who you are its freedom so sometimes the facts are good and sometimes the facts are bad the important thing from the point of view of a principle as broad and important as freedom of speech is that the courts articulate and set forth in a very protective way what those principles are i love to deer hunt and fish and drive down the back roads in my truck all those things basically equal freedom to me  and not having to return that message or call from my record company or management at some point i need to recharge institutions  government churches industries and the like  have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail on the whole to perform this function they are wrong and need reconstruction freedom is such a gift it is not the simple statement of facts that ushers in freedom it is the constant repetition of them that has this liberating effect tolerance is the result not of enlightenment but of boredom the american dream is about freedom freedom is secured every day by our men and women in uniform we must build a future worthy of their sacrifice the greatest enemy of individual freedom is the individual himself i try to give the media as many confusing images as i can to retain my freedom whats real is for my children and the people i live with one of the rewards of success is freedom the ability to do whatever you like ruin is the destination toward which all men rush each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons freedom in a commons brings ruin to all freedom is the emancipation from the arbitrary rule of other men the freedom to criticize judges and other public officials is necessary to a vibrant democracy the problem comes when healthy criticism is replaced with more destructive intimidation and sanctions i love the freedom of movement that my phone gives me that has definitely transformed my life until you have lost your reputation you never realize what a burden it was or what freedom really is it is exactly because we are a city that embraces freedom that welcomes everyone and encourages their dreams that new york remains on the front lines in the war on terror ironically it is exactly because we are a city that embraces freedom that welcomes everyone and encourages their dreams that new york remains on the front lines in the war on terror i do think there are certain times we should infringe on your freedom to be honest ive always had far too much freedom i had a job when i was 10 i started living on my own when i was 17 or 18 ive earned my own money ive traveled the world what would i rebel against im a multidimensional person and thats the freedom of fashion that youre able to reinvent yourself through how you dress and how you cut your hair or whatever no one who has lived even for a fleeting moment for something other than life in its conventional sense and has experienced the exaltation that this feeling produces can then renounce his new freedom so easily remove advertising disable a person or firm from proclaiming its wares and their merits and the whole of society and of the economy is transformed the enemies of advertising are the enemies of freedom most men after a little freedom have preferred authority with the consoling assurances and the economy of effort it brings so the comic book legal defense fund is out there preserving and fighting for and sometimes winning and sometimes losing the fight for first amendment rights in comics and more generally for freedom of speech theres a glorious sense of freedom in comedy just allowing myself to tell jokes allowing myself to interrupt myself and tell old african folk stories that i made up  or didnt  and jamaican stories the worst enemy of truth and freedom in our society is the compact majority the pillars of truth and the pillars of freedom  they are the pillars of society our forefathers got it they got it man they took godly principles and they put them into action and they developed our constitution  the land of freedom where each man is accountable and responsible for his actions the first amendment freedom of religion is as important today as when the bill of rights was first written one certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression certain things happened in the early church women who had never had any freedom suddenly have the ability to stand up and speak and be treated as equals within the life of the church their poverty secured their freedom since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism the only thing money gives you is the freedom of not worrying about money when a truth is not given complete freedom freedom is not complete human beings want to be free and however long they may agree to stay locked up to stay oppressed there will come a time when they say thats it suddenly they find themselves doing something that they never would have thought they would be doing simply because of the human instinct that makes them turn their face towards freedom we hold our heads high despite the price we have paid because freedom is priceless freedom begins as we become conscious of it the problem of the world today is the people talk on and on about democracy freedom justice but i dont give a damn about democracy if i am worried about survival there must be freedom for all to live to think to worship no book no avenue must be closed freedom is the byproduct of economic surplus while democrats fussed with the details of health care reforms conservatives spent months telling the nation that the real issue is freedom that whats on the line is american liberty itself there are few things in politics more annoying than the rights utter conviction that it owns the patent on the word freedom that when its leaders stand up for the rights of banks to be unregulated or capital gains to be untaxed that it is actually and obviously standing up for human liberty the noblest cause of them all women are degraded by the propensity to enjoy the present moment and at last despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain the condition every art requires is not so much freedom from restriction as freedom from adulteration and from the intrusion of foreign matter if you are for freedom and equal rights which we hear a lot of talk about these days then you have to include the lgbtq community in that and if youre not willing to put your time where your mouth is then i dont know quite what you mean by commitment in your life the united states and israel have a unique relationship based on our mutual commitment to democracy freedom and peace therefore just as our commitment to these principles must be steadfast so must our support for israel bush is morally a universalist for instance he says the freedom is good the same thing is good all over the world so in that sense hes a universalist bush sees the evil as out there in the wider world residing in people who hate freedom look at his immediate response to the pictures of prisoner abuse this is not what americans do these are not our values freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism i really feel that the talent i have is acting freedom and the possibility of playthat is what i like to have in the beginning i loved being famous but now i am tired of it and i would like to go back to my freedom the bill of rights was intended to secure freedom of speech  the freedom of speech of members of parliament to speak freely rather than be at threat of the threat of an over powerful monarch at the time i will never understand people who think that the way to show their righteous opposition to sexual freedom is to write letters full of filthy words well the first thing is that truth and power for me form an antithesis an antagonism which will hardly ever be resolved i can define in fact can simplify the history of human society the evolution of human society as a contest between power and freedom my grandfather was a man when he talked about freedom his attitude was really interesting his view was that you had obligations or you had responsibilities and when you fulfilled those obligations or responsibilities that then gave you the liberty to do other things too much freedom can lead to the souls decay freedom has a price most people arent willing to pay it great research universities must insist on independence from government and on the exercise of academic freedom i was determined to achieve the total freedom that our history lessons taught us we were entitled to no matter what the sacrifice modernism released us from the constraints of everything that had gone before with a euphoric sense of freedom resist this war on god freedom of religion and freedom of speech ive come to realize that protecting freedom of choice in our everyday lives is essential to maintaining a healthy civil society to criticize a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous but to criticize their religion that is a right that is a freedom for the past several years i have remained what others would consider underground i did this in order to build a community of people likeminded in their desire for freedom and the right to pursue their goals and lives without being manipulated and controlled by a media protected military industrial complex with a completely different agenda as crucial as religion has been and is to the life of the nation americas unifying force has never been a specific faith but a commitment to freedom  not least freedom of conscience the spread of freedom is the best security for the free but there is a corollary to freedom and thats personal responsibility and the real challenge is how you generate that personal responsibility without imposing it it is a strange fact that freedom and equality the two basic ideas of democracy are to some extent contradictory logically considered freedom and equality are mutually exclusive just as society and the individual are mutually exclusive my wife needs her freedom just like me you have the freedom to live and let live to love and let love granting yourself that freedom is one of the healthiest most constructive things you can do for yourself and the people who matter to you beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance this great land of ordered liberty for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin the declaration of independence was always our vision of who we wanted to be our ideal of freedom and justice how we were going to be different and what the american experiment was going to be about her beauty didnt do her any good and she couldnt use it in any positive way or manipulative way i just hope that people will look and see and believe in that hope of love that hope of freedom even if it was just for a limited time the spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom  these are the pillars of society if our freedom is taken the american dream will wither and die now one of the most essential branches of english liberty is the freedom of ones house the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact no my work does not reflect my sexual preferences it reflects the fact that i feel total freedom as an artist i like repressed characters that gives me a lot of freedom to make a lot of different choices through subtleties the work of art is a scream of freedom as the fly bangs against the window attempting freedom while the door stands open so we bang against death ignoring heaven freedom of choice is more to be treasured than any possession earth can give you have riches and freedom here but i feel no sense of faith or direction you have so many computers why dont you use them in the search for love the hope of the nation which throughout the nineteenth century had not for a moment reconciled itself with the loss of independence and fighting for its own freedom fought at the same time for the freedom of other nations i most sincerely wish that the world in which we live be free from the threat of a nuclear holocaust and from the ruinous arms race it is my cherished desire that peace be not separated from freedom which is the right of every nation this i desire and for this i pray freedom must be gained step by step slowly freedom is a food which must be carefully administered when people are too hungry for it freedom is an indivisible word if we want to enjoy it and fight for it we must be prepared to extend it to everyone whether they are rich or poor whether they agree with us or not no matter what their race or the color of their skin freedom requires no effort to enjoy but requires heroic efforts to preserve ive got personal views on the 60s you cant have freedom without paying the price for it we clearly realize that freedoms inner kingdom cannot be touched by exterior attacks if one is going to err one should err on the side of liberty and freedom americas veterans have served their country with the belief that democracy and freedom are ideals to be upheld around the world music is where i have the most creative freedom but i love producing to me thats kind of where all the action is you get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film from picking a director sometimes picking a writer to the actors the wardrobe set design editing music and marketing jobs mean freedom for workers to support their families many will view the compromises that will be made during your negotiations as painful concessions but why not view them as peace offerings ones that will provide in return the priceless gifts of hope security and freedom for our children and our childrens rock and roll music  the music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner of conservative defense mechanisms freedom is mans capacity to take a hand in his own development it is our capacity to mold ourselves human freedom involves our capacity to pause to choose the one response toward which we wish to throw our weight you can be a thousand different women its your choice which one you want to be its about freedom and sovereignty you celebrate who you are you say this is my kingdom israel was born under the british mandate we learned from the british what democracy means and how it behaves in a time of danger war and terror we thank britain for introducing freedom and respect of human rights both in normal and demanding circumstances when the united states was founded the very idea of a nation premised on democratic principles of freedom and tolerance was viewed by the vast majority of the world as an experiment doomed to fail dictatorships monarchies and theocracies had for many centuries ruled the world if you dont mind haunting the margins i think there is more freedom there we know from our own history that democratic institutions take decades to mature and we know from past conflicts that freedom is not free if its total freedom i guess the ultimate thing you can go into is total silence between the audience and performer with the performer projecting something he doesnt even have to play we know the road to freedom has always been stalked by death freedom from care and anxiety of mind is a blessing which i apprehend such people enjoy in higher perfection than most others and is of the utmost consequence we all have the right of freedom of speech under the first amendment we all dont have to agree with one another on our opinions everyone in my circle that i run around with we all feel the same about god country integrity and character next in importance to freedom and justice is popular education without which neither freedom nor justice can be permanently maintained an almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions they seem to sense that gold and economic freedom are inseparable any one who wants to live in peace and freedom will be to live by toil demonstration of high levels of discipline and tolerance for one another laying tracks gives you freedom without being too obvious woe to that nation whose literature is cut short by the intrusion of force this is not merely interference with freedom of the press but the sealing up of a nations heart the excision of its memory bastard freedom waves her fustian flag in mockery over slaves i think to be  for me to be an american is  you know its one of the greatest things in the world for  you know for me just because ive been able to grow up with everything the freedom you know in my eyes this is the greatest country in the world we dont have an official secrets act in the united states as other countries do under the first amendment freedom of the press freedom of speech and freedom of association are more important than protecting secrets those who write the editorials and those who write the columns they simply are unaccountable theyre free to impose their cultural politics in the name of freedom of the press i believe firmly that in making ethical decisions man has the prerogative of true freedom of choice true freedom is the capacity for acting according to ones true character to be altogether ones self to be selfdetermined and not subject to outside coercion now do i think there has to be shared sacrifice among other nations in the world who want a stable and secure world absolutely there has to be but i dont think that america can ever abdicate its leadership role in the world because of who we are and where weve come from we are the symbol for the world for freedom and liberty it is true you cannot eat freedom and you cannot power machinery with democracy but then neither can political prisoners turn on the light in the cells of a dictatorship one mans blasphemy doesnt override other peoples freespeech rights their freedom to publish freedom of thought we must plan for freedom and not only for security if for no other reason than that only freedom can make security secure because if you lived as i did several years under nazi totalitarianism and then 20 years in communist totalitarianism you would certainly realize how precious freedom is and how easy it is to lose your freedom if this liberal potential is properly channeled we may expect the area of freedom of the united states to increase the problem is to spend up our rate of social invention in the service of the welfare of all the people he who believes in freedom of the will has never loved and never hated anything outside marriage seems like freedom and excitement there are forces all around you who wish to exploit division rob you of your freedom and tell you what to think but young folks can rekindle the weary spirit of a slumbering nation i tasted freedom and i really liked it in the end nature is inexorable it has no reason to hurry and sooner or later it takes what belongs to it unconsciously and inflexibly obedient to its own laws it doesnt know art just as it doesnt know freedom just as it doesnt know goodness freedom is not won by merely overthrowing a tyrannical ruler or an oppressive regime that is usually only the prelude to a new tyranny a new oppression freedom begins with what we teach our children that is why jews became a people whose passion is education whose heroes are teachers and whose citadels are schools the message of passover remains as powerful as ever freedom is won not on the battlefield but in the classroom and the home teach your children the history of freedom if you want them never to lose it what creates freedom a revolution in the streets mass protest civil war a change of government the ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new history more often than not shows that hopes raised by such events are often dashed sooner rather than later the financial reward is great and i love the life i have but all money makes possible is for you to stop worrying about money then you have freedom to live your life when i was teaching in the 1960s in boston there was a great deal of hope in the air martin luther king jr was alive malcolm x was alive great great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement the american experience influenced my understanding of individuality basic human rights freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens take young researchers put them together in virtual seclusion give them an unprecedented degree of freedom and turn up the pressure by fostering competitiveness i learned what i really love is making films not the film business i want to be on the set meeting with writers i want that freedom i love it now never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth you know if you are kind of rich the best thing is that you dont have to think about money the best thing you can buy with money is freedom time i dont know how much i earn a year i have no idea i dont know how much i pay in taxes i think we recognize as americans there are certain things that are just primary to the freedoms and liberties that we enjoy here and religious freedom is one of the most important things we as americans cherish to us americans much has been given of us much is required with all our faults and mistakes it is our strength in support of the freedom our forefathers loved which has saved mankind from subjection to totalitarian power all americans value the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press and i believe this is essential for our continued way of life but with this freedom comes responsibility that responsibility has been abdicated here by some in the media and some in the government ive never understood why people consider youth a time of freedom and joy its probably because they have forgotten their own i like the freedom of podcasting with podcasting you can really mess around with the form and the format you can do as much time as you like without having to pause for commercials i wanted to try to push some freedom into the mens clothes religious tolerance is something we should all practice however there have been more persecution and atrocities committed in the name of religion and religious freedom than anything else a free and truly independent press  fiercely independent when necessary  is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy after the tragedy new yorkers are more united than ever in their vision as well as in appreciation what living in freedom means  and that if we stand together we can accomplish anything roosevelt talked not only about freedom from fear but also freedom from want the greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom but in the last analysis our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves well im a libertarian conservative so i believe in limited governmentmaximum individual freedom all the characters in my films are fighting these problems needing freedom trying to find a way to cut themselves loose but failing to rid themselves of conscience a sense of sin the whole bag of tricks i dont think that artists of any kind would or could sacrifice their artistic freedom by being more responsible with their influence on people especially young people if you can make people understand why freedom is so important through the arts that would be a big help i remain optimistic what weve seen in europe and the rest of the world is that freedom has a much stronger attraction than radical fundamentalism criticism of government finds sanctuary in several portions of the 1st amendment it is part of the right of free speech it embraces freedom of the press so far as discipline is concerned freedom means not its absence but the use of higher and more rational forms as contrasted with those that are lower or less rational every general increase of freedom is accompanied by some degeneracy attributable to the same causes as the freedom giving up even an ounce of precious freedom is a very serious thing to do but short films are not inferior just different i think the short gives a freedom to filmmakers whats appealing is that you dont have as much responsibility for storytelling and plot they can be more like a portrait or a poem they have the ability to take a persons freedom from them on certain situations they have the ability to take a persons reputation and under certain circumstances they have the authority to take a persons life when others stood idly by you and your families gave your all in defence of a risen people and in pursuit of irish freedom and unity i feel like my honesty gives people the freedom to talk about things they wouldnt otherwise my view is that good community management is like having good municipal government you should be able to have dissenting opinions and so on freedom of speech but your grandmother should also be able to walk down the street at night without having to worry about getting mugged i now bid farewell to the country of my birth  of my passions  of my death a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies  whose factions i sought to quell  whose intelligence i prompted to a lofty aim  whose freedom has been my fatal dream peace with the palestinians will open ports of peace all around the mediterranean the duty of leaders is to pursue freedom ceaselessly even in the face of hostility in the face of doubt and disappointment just imagine what could be i call on the iranian people it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious persian heritage a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles how can a nation allow a regime to instill fear take away the peoples freedom and shock the young generation that seeks its way out of the dictatorial iran the middle east is ailing the malady stems from pervasive violence shortages of food water and educational opportunities discrimination against women and  the most virulent cause of all  the absence of freedom my heart goes out to the brave citizens of syria who each day risk and even sacrifice their lives to achieve freedom from a murderous regime we in israel welcome the historic struggle to forge democratic peaceloving governments in our region rosa parks was the queen mother of a movement whose single act of heroism sparked the movement for freedom justice and equality her greatest contribution is that she told us a regular person can make a difference we who officially value freedom of speech above life itself seem to have nothing to talk about but the weather today is a celebration of hope for the iraqi people the iraqi people can now take control of their government and their future by creating a society that protects the rights endowed to us by our creator  life liberty and freedom motorists who want to save money on gas will demand and buy more fuelefficient vehicles we should not limit their freedom with more government regulations more than anything else let me be clear  we need to be willing to fight for freedom and free markets and traditional moral values thats what the american people want to see this movement and this party return to i was intelligent enough to make up my own mind i not only had freedom of choice i had freedom of expression personal technology has given us the freedom of being able to do whatever we want  and in the case of celebrities and athletes whomever they want but it can also serve as a humiliation jetpack the year most of my high school friends and i got our drivers permits the coolest thing one could do was stand outside after school and twirl ones car keys like a lifeguard whistle that jingling sound meant freedom and power i dont believe in firing professors they have academic freedom we believe it wrong ever to take a dollar from a free citizen without a very necessary public purpose because each such taking diminishes the freedom to spend that dollar as its owner would prefer i defend both the freedom of expression and societys right to counter it i must pay the price for differing it is the natural way of things americans are free to choose everything from what they eat drive and watch on tv to the president of the united states yet when it comes to allowing americans to choose the health insurance that works best for them and their family the freedom to choose suddenly becomes unamerican i think the american people have become more reliant upon government and less reliant upon themselves and that they now tend to put security ahead of freedom but i think freedom is the most important aspect of our lives if they want to hang me let them and on the scaffold i will shout freedom for the working class thats why i like fast film it gives you more freedom to light more naturally whatever the immediate gains and losses the dangers to our safety arising from political suppression are always greater than the dangers to the safety resulting from political freedom suppression is always foolish freedom is always wise no i dont believe in genius i believe in freedom i think anyone can do it anyone can be like rembrandt well one thing you got to stand in a courtroom and listen to a judge sentencing you to 25 years in prison before you realize that freedom of expression can no longer be taken for granted it would be too frightening for me to consider myself a role model but i like the idea of not being afraid of letting your imagination rule you to feel the freedom of expression to let creativity be your overwhelming drive rather than other things i have the freedom to do what i want bright people to talk to every day even in the darkest regions people have discovered their right of freedom the search for human freedom can never be complete without freedom for women if you scratch below the surface and ask what really makes me tick its the liberalism of trying to promote freedom and opportunity promoting social mobility is one of the keys to that i dont watch a huge amount of telly i read a lot im reading at the moment freedom by jonathan franzen a great big brick of a book and im loving it i am a passionate believer in freedom of speech i would not support anything which would impinge on aggressive robust freedom of the british press but when things go wrong and there has been outright illegality there should be proper accountability i have more freedom when i write fiction but my memoirs have had a much stronger impact on my readers somehow the message even if i am not even aware that there is one is conveyed better in this form as one gets older one sees many more paths that could be taken artists sense within their own work that kind of swelling of possibilities which may seem a freedom or a confusion the arc of american history almost inevitably moves toward freedom whether its lincoln and the emancipation proclamation the expansion of womens rights or now gay rights i think there is an almostinevitable march toward greater civil liberties i came out of the soviet union no longer a communist because i believed in personal freedom as our federal government has grown too large and too powerful the real loss has been the freedom of people to govern their own lives and participate fully in the american dream i loved the feeling of freedom in running the fresh air the feeling that the only person im competing with is me i wasnt a woman who stayed tiny like i thought i would i definitely gave myself the freedom to eat what i wanted im privileged because i have a lot of freedom i want to use it to make as warm and normal a life as i can for our daughters ive sold my soul for freedom its lonely but its sweet so why am i facing a recall election simple the big government union bosses from washington want their money they dont like the fact that i did something fundamentally proworker something thats truly about freedom they know the importance of their mission and of americas commitment to combating and defeating terrorism abroad and they know that they are making a real difference in bringing freedom to a part of the world that has known only tyranny they have called operation iraqi freedom a war of choice that isnt part of the real war on terror someone should tell that to al qaeda the job of training an iraqi police force is one of the most important tasks being undertaken in operation iraqi freedom it is also one of the most difficult i really care about this stuff i care about movies and you just have to be strong and dont be stupid freedom of choice is a big responsibility and im lucky enough not to have to just take any movie to pay the rent so theres no need to be greedy as a 22year army veteran who served in operations desert storm and iraqi freedom and as a civilian advisor to the afghan army in operation enduring freedom i understand both the gravity of giving the order and the challenge of carrying it out i love the freedom that the narrative form provides freedom is just chaos with better lighting prosperity or egalitarianism  you have to choose i favor freedom  you never achieve real equality anyway you simply sacrifice prosperity for an illusion as a boy i believed freedom for america meant freedom for me there was a time i believed every word spoken recruitment and retention are critical to sustain our armed forces with the best men and women willing to stand in the gap and make huge sacrifices to ensure our freedom i believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience otherwise why go for it i have to change me and i have to learn things and i have to push me and my limits by acting i find a freedom inside of a prison in a way i believe in trying to get a balance between individual freedom on the one hand and social responsibility on the other private property was the original source of freedom it still is its main ballpark theres a freedom to being young that is harder to come by as time goes on i am known for a life spent in the struggle for freedom and freedom includes the freedom of religion i suppose theres a melancholy tone at the back of the american mind a sense of something lost and its the lost world of thomas jefferson it is the lost sense of innocence that we could live with a very minimal state with a vast sense of space in which to work out freedom i needed freedom to really express myself thats really what justified is about not caring more about what other people think than what you think thats freedom the freedom of all is essential to my freedom freedom is not an ideal it is not even a protection if it means nothing more than freedom to stagnate to live without dreams to have no greater aim than a second car and another television set to realize that new world we must prefer the values of freedom and equality above all other values  above personal wealth technical power and nationalism one of the things that bothers me most is the growing belief in the country that security is more important than freedom it aint i believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink it is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty and freedom it is the history of our nation and its marked by the blood of those who died defending it a sense of freedom is something that happily comes with age and life experience in the last analysis our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves you learn that you either are going to have a police state where you dont have any freedom left or youre going to build a world that doesnt create terrorists  and that means a whole different way of getting along the people who are competing businesswise out there want what other successful labels and artists have i dont want what they have i want my own path my own sound my own identity record labels care nothing about identity or artistic freedom they want good business just as the security council was largely irrelevant to the great struggle of the last half of the twentieth century  freedom against communism  so too it is largely on the sidelines in our contemporary struggles against international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction i never abandoned either forms or freedom i imagine that most of what could be called free verse is in my first book i got through that fairly early the nice thing about the bible is it doesnt give you too many facts two an a half lines and it tells you the whole story and that leaves you a great deal of freedom to elaborate on how it might have happened i feel like my work has been my path to freedom from having grown up in a segregated environment the american idea is as promising imaginative and full of the unexpected as the land itself the land represents freedom  the frontier the ability to make a new future with your own bare hands i loved climbing because of the freedom and having time and space i remember coming off everest for the last time thinking of dad and wishing that he could have seen what i saw he would have loved it you cannot mistake bushs clarity of purpose he believes in a story about freedom and opportunity that makes his followers feel like they arent just ticking their days down but are part of something larger than themselves i dont look so closely at womens fashion but from the 20th century on people have had the freedom to express themselves and their individualities and fashion is one of the most fundamental ways in which they do this men and women are equally able to express themselves the people of the middle east share the desire for freedom we have an opportunity  and an obligation  to help them turn this desire into reality the us has since the end of world war ii had an answer  we stand for free peoples and free markets we are willing to support and defend them  we will sustain a balance of power that favors freedom we are expected to believe that anyone who objects to the department of homeland security or the usa patriot act is a terrorist and that the only way to preserve our freedom is to hand it over to the government for safekeeping the freedom of each individual can only be the freedom of all only the freedom of mind can prevent the state from becoming totalitarian and from issuing totalitarian demands it is for each of us freely to choose whom we shall serve and find in that obedience our freedom every dictator is an enemy of freedom an opponent of law thus the struggle for peace includes the struggle for freedom and justice for the masses of all countries they call them terrorists i call them freedom fighters what does it mean to be an american while each of us may have our own specific answer to that question we likely can agree on the basic principles of america freedom equal opportunity and rights accompanied by responsibilities wealth is a tool of freedom but the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery being big and famous doesnt get you more freedom it gets you less your determination selflessness and courage have brought the freedom struggle towards its fulfilment so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidycats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce freedom of religion is a principle that is central to our nations declaration of independence congress has taken this positive step to protect our freedom to express allegiance to americas flag and the ideals it represents i wish we would all remember that being american is not just about the freedom we have it is about those who gave it to us if liberty has any meaning it means freedom to improve in america its live by the sword of freedom of expression and be will to die by it as well thats free enterprise friends freedom to gamble freedom to lose and the great thing  the truly democratic thing about it  is that you dont even have to be a player to lose native americans are the original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the united states they have helped develop the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of powers that form the foundation of the united states government it is crucial that members of congress cast votes that are supportive of the values upon which our nation was founded equality freedom and opportunity for all people ive never let producers tell me what to do even when i was making television i always did what i wanted to do and if i couldnt i didnt do it it was a freedom that these days young directors starting out dont have for us holding on to religious rules and following them and refraining from whats forbidden and being diligent with our duties what do we call that thats what we call freedom private ownership of property is vital to both our freedom and our prosperity liberty freedom and democracy are very fuzzy words but human rights is very specific freedom and responsibility arent interconnected things they are the same thing the communitarians may say youve been enjoying too much individual freedom and that you must give up some of that for the benefit of the community but they really mean that they want more power over your life  to force you to subsidize obey and conform to their choices an open society is a society which allows its members the greatest possible degree of freedom in pursuing their interests compatible with the interests of others my philosophy is dont take no for an answer and be willing to sacrifice your entire project for freedom is walt turning over in his grave a man named joe roth runs disney right nowhe gave me the goahead and total freedom to do whatever i wanted to do none of us had any idea of how successful downton was going to be i thought i was signing up for another period drama that had a slightly modern feel it had a freedom about it because it was coming out of the head of julian fellowes anything could happen and generally did every american deserves to live in freedom to have his or her privacy respected and a chance to go as far as their ability and effort will take them  regardless of race gender ethnicity or economic circumstances responsibility and respect of others and their religious beliefs are also part of freedom if freedoms best friends cannot unify around a realistic actionable program of fundamental change one that attracts and persuades a broad majority of our fellow citizens big change will not come the vietnamese people deeply love independence freedom and peace but in the face of united states aggression they have risen up united as one man freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose real freedom is creative proactive and will take me into new territories i am not free if my freedom is predicated on reacting to my past there is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom produces and that cure is freedom i do believe that freedom isnt free  but today the corporate and political right wing is trying to cheapen this truly american value theyve been cynically using the word freedom to rally the american public against its own best interests i say lets go back to a truer use of the word freedom lets start with president franklin roosevelts four freedoms freedom of speech and expression freedom of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear i would add the freedom to bargain collectively those freedoms are under attack today people should have freedom in their pilgrimages and tours they should come and visit historical monuments and sites  lets say the sites around iran  where they can easily engage in wide scale contacts with others when we are unwilling to draw clear moral lines between free societies and fear societies when we are unwilling to call the former good and the latter evil we will not be able to advance the cause of peace because peace cannot be disconnected from freedom that freedom that picasso afforded himself to be an artist in a huge number of ways seems to be a huge psychological liberation woman must have her freedom the fundamental freedom of choosing whether or not she will be a mother and how many children she will have regardless of what mans attitude may be that problem is hers  and before it can be his it is hers alone the progress of freedom depends more upon the maintenance of peace the spread of commerce and the diffusion of education than upon the labors of cabinets and foreign offices my parents came from russia and suddenly they wound up in boston massachusetts brookline massachusetts and they felt the sun rose and set on franklin delano roosevelts backside because he meant so much to them this was freedom this was something totally different from the russia they had left revolution the people howls and cries freedom thats what were needing weve needed it for centuries our arteries are bleeding the stage is shaking the audience rock the whole thing is over by nine oclock any existence deprived of freedom is a kind of death new ideas should confront old ideas we must refer to the example of europe people have fought to make europe what it is today freedom is not something that is served up on a plate the higher one climbs on the spiritual ladder the more they will grant others their own freedom and give less interference to anothers state of consciousness humanism an exaltation of freedom but one limited by our need to exercise it as an integral part of nature and society i definitely wanted to earn my freedom but the primary motivation wasnt making money but making an impact at 6 years old the ice became a place for me to express myself because i was so shy off the ice it became my safe haven with music and freedom and selfexpression that was my emotional outlet the abortion license has not brought freedom and security to women rather it has ushered in a new era of irresponsibility toward women and children one that now begins before birth i suffered evils but without allowing them to rob me of the freedom to expand but i do believe that a womans truest place is in a home with a husband and with children and with large freedom pecuniary freedom personal freedom and the right to vote dont give me any money dont give me any people but give freedom and ill give you a movie that looks gigantic widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country for more than 60 years anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed chinese art is merely a product it avoids any meaningful engagement there is no larger context its only purpose is to charm viewers with its ambiguity china has not established the rule of law and if there is a power above the law there is no social justice everybody can be subjected to harm im just a citizen my life is equal in value to any other but im thankful that when i lost my freedom so many people shared feelings and put such touching effort into helping me the birds nest national stadium which i helped to conceive is designed to embody the olympic spirit of fair competition it tells people that freedom is possible but needs fairness courage and strength strong generous and confident she has nobly served mankind beware how you trifle with your marvellous inheritance this great land of ordered liberty for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin the freedom now desired by many is not freedom to do and dare but freedom from care and worry patrick henry did not say give me absolutely safety or give me death america is supposed to be about freedom now then in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom i spent a great deal of time with che guevara while i was in havana i believe he was far less a mercenary than he was a freedom fighter theres a hell of a lot of freedom in this rock and roll circus its where all the freaks go  its the environment for me my daughters your daughters our daughters deserve safety protection and the freedom to make their own choices about their personal lives and their physical selves i mean theres enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world  within the eu between china and the united states which way is it going to go its hard to see but in the first gulf war the united kingdom was not under any threat from iraq and is still less so in the second one then there is no justification for obstructing freedom of information particularly as nations have a right to know what their soldiers are being used for it is hard to know how many people do but given that the people are so docile towards the rulers nowadays very few americans show the passion for freedom that our forefathers had the increased presence of muslims in italy and in europe is directly proportional to our loss of freedom freedom means the freedom to behave coarsely basely foolishly government has the role of suiting people for freedom people arent made for freedom spontaneously theres sort of a 19year race between when people are born and when they become adults and government has a role in making them at the end of 19 years suited to be upright trustworthy repositories of popular sovereignty freedom is an internal achievement rather than an external adjustment i started skydiving because i loved the idea of freedom we are all different yet we are all gods children we are all united behind this country and the common cause of freedom justice fairness and equality that is what unites us president bush in his inaugural address talked about bringing freedom to countries that dont have it he didnt specify how to deny the freedom of the will is to make morality impossible all americans and freedomloving people around the world owe president reagan our deepest gratitude for his strong principled leadership that ended the cold war and brought freedom to millions of people theres also a sense of freedom i was so obsessed by this problem that i was thinking about if all the time  when i woke up in the morning when i went to sleep at night and that went on for eight years one of the unsung freedoms that go with a free press is the freedom not to read it value your freedom or you will lose it teaches history dont bother us with politics respond those who dont want to learn free software is software that respects your freedom and the social solidarity of your community so its free as in freedom in the freelibre software movement we develop software that respects users freedom so we and you can escape from software that doesnt if ebooks mean that readers freedom must either increase or decrease we must demand the increase with paper printed books you have certain freedoms you can acquire the book anonymously by paying cash which is the way i always buy books i never use a credit card i dont identify to any database when i buy books amazon takes away that freedom when i launched the development of the gnu system i explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom then its a success its not popularity for our code but its success for our goal i believe dreams represent the purest form of fantasy we unleash through our subconscious they represent the truest freedom we can experience totally unrepressed and totally creative i would say that the war correspondent gets more drinks more girls better pay and greater freedom than the soldier but at this stage of the game having the freedom to choose his spot and being allowed to be a coward and not be executed for it is his torture the freedom of thought is a sacred right of every individual man and diversity will continue to increase with the progress refinement and differentiation of the human intellect thats part of american greatness is discrimination yes sir inequality i think breeds freedom and gives a man opportunity carry out the republican principle of universal suffrage or strike it from your banners and substitute freedom and power to one half of society and submission and slavery to the other freedom is always the freedom of dissenters freedom only for the members of the government only for the members of the party  though they are quite numerous  is no freedom at all all my life americans have been accustomed to thinking of theirs as the richest freest country in the world by most measurements it was long a contender for that honor and  among the larger countries if equal weight were given to wealth and indices of freedom  probably did deserve to be so described when we through our educational culture through the media through the entertainment culture give our children the impression that human beings cannot control their passions we are telling them in effect that human beings cannot be trusted with freedom with courage and character american soldiers continue to put themselves on the line to defend our freedom and so many have paid the ultimate sacrifice they were singing in french but the melody was freedom and any american could understand that our work is a scream of freedom with one man there was a freedom and liberation that was with michael hutchence my partner in life freedom of expression is the matrix the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom american movies and music deliver themes of freedom innocence and power that appeal to others  partly because america itself was put together out of a multiplicity of national traditions our founders warned against this they said dont that your liberty is only as secure as the people are because once they um get the ability to vote themselves entitlements from the largesse of the government liberty is done freedom is over with we were warned we are there judgment traps you within the limitations of your comparisons it inhibits freedom men like me who merely wish to establish political freedom will in such circumstances lose all their influence and others will get influence who may become dangerous to all established interests whatsoever i know that throughout their history the people of the united states defended their freedom their liberty their justice and their rights  if need be  with their lives i think their courage is so admirable the law of god reaches into every area of life and it brings about incredible blessing and incredible freedom i stand for limited government fiscal responsibility personal freedom personal responsibility so the republican party will support me but it required a disastrous internecine war to bring this question of human freedom to a crisis and the process of striking the shackles from the slave was accomplished in a single hour if we want to talk about freedom we must mean freedom for others as well as ourselves and we must mean freedom for everyone inside our frontiers as well as outside having grown up in bombay from the day youre born you have absolute freedom to choose who you want to be it could be my british need for discipline that makes me admire the american appetite for freedom and passion ultimately we know deeply that the other side of every fear is freedom that feeling of freedom open highways of possibilities has kind of been lost to materialism and marketing life is a very orderly thing but in fiction there is a huge liberation and freedom i can do what i like theres nothing that says i cant write a page of full stops there is no should involved although you wouldnt know that from literary reviews and critics republican values  strong families faith personal responsibility and freedom among others  are not unique to specific subsets of the electorate they are universal values and it is republicans job to remind americans of that fact i think there is a heritage which im proud of which is a fight for democracy a fight for social justice a fight for freedom my grandfather went to jail or exile six times in his life fighting for his principles for democracy or for his country and my father twice the legal difference between the sitins and the freedom riders was significant i have always been a firm believer in the longstanding american principle of having the right to bear arms and i will remain committed to see that this freedom is not infringed upon revoked or limited in any way eventually i want to be a fulltime mother who works occasionally  and being an actor you have that freedom many have left their families to defend our freedom we salute their bravery we express our appreciation and support to their families and we pray for their safe return the old romans all wished to have a king over them because they had not yet tasted the sweetness of freedom we believe that salvation is to be found in wholesome work in a beloved land work will provide our people with the bread of tomorrow and moreover with the honor of the tomorrow the freedom of the tomorrow time misspent in youth is sometimes all the freedom one ever has when i was younger i was listening to a lot of armenian music you know revolutionary music about freedom and protest in the 70s i was listening to soul and the bee gees and abba and funk the thing is this you got to have fun while youre fightin for freedom cause you dont always win i dont think that there is absolute freedom of the press we operate under laws  against libel for instance the idea that there is some absolute press freedom is kind of a myth many a time freedom has been rolled back  and always for the same sorry reason fear havin fun while freedom fightin must be one of those lunatic texas traits we get from the water  which is known to have lithium in it  because it goes all the way back to sam houston surely the most lovable the most human and the funniest of all the great men this country has ever produced the freedom to connect to the world anywhere at anytime brings with it the threat of unscrupulous predators and criminals who mask their activities with the anonymity the internet provides to its users yoga is a way to freedom by its constant practice we can free ourselves from fear anguish and loneliness there is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you except that which he gains by kindness and attachment latinos have fought in all of americas wars beginning with the revolutionary war many latinos are fighting and dying for our country today in iraq just as several of their ancestors fought for freedom in mexico over a century ago history is full of examples of people who clamp down after they began to enjoy too much freedom freedom can lead to instability anarchy and confusion so there can be a moral counterrevolution with napster and the sharing of music of course there are going to be people who exploit it greed has no end but theres a lot of good that could happen we shouldnt let the economic concerns of the major labels infringe on our freedom to share music i do have the freedom to choose what i want to do and ill continue to do that jazz is about freedom within discipline usually a dictatorship like in russia and germany will prevent jazz from being played because it just seemed to represent freedom democracy and the united states many people dont understand how disciplined you have to be to play jazz and that is really the idea of democracy  freedom within the constitution or discipline you dont just get out there and do anything you want jazz stands for freedom its supposed to be the voice of freedom get out there and improvise and take chances and dont be a perfectionist  leave that to the classical musicians i was 37 when my father diedand i no longer had any freedom of choice over what i would do with the rest of my life this enemy of peace in the world today is unlike any we have seen in the past and our military is learning from and building on previous successes while carrying peace and freedom into the future i have just enough people paying attention that i have the freedom to be in charge and i have a great record company  nonesuch understands what im about the united states is a giant island of freedom achievement wealth and prosperity in a world hostile to our values maybe a part of me recognized how right the improvising spirit of jazz is not the sounds but the freedom to work with musicians who work that way it felt very natural to me but i think theres a way to do it without it being a jazz record that happens every time i get behind a guitar regardless of what im saying cause music is freedom and being free is the closest ive ever felt to being spiritual you have an absolute freedom in mexican writing today in which you dont necessarily have to deal with the mexican identity you know why because we have an identity we know who we are we know what it means to be a mexican for science must breathe the oxygen of freedom its good that the first half of the speech emphasized freedom because george w bush has been the global champion for freedom as he said if we dont fight tyranny it will not leave us alone in peace a culture without property or in which creators cant get paid is anarchy not freedom the attitude is we live and let live this is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and its an example of freedom from religion i dont have anything to prove anymore i dont have a record deal no one has any expectations im in a position of freedom i dont need anyones approval working with david cronenberg or darren aronofsky or even steven soderbergh isnt really like a typical hollywood movie these are true artists and have a certain amount of freedom when they work and theyre more like independent filmmakers making their way through big studios your life is the sum result of all the choices you make both consciously and unconsciously if you can control the process of choosing you can take control of all aspects of your life you can find the freedom that comes from being in charge of yourself i have always that there ought to be some kind of mandatory national service not necessarily in the military but to show everybody that freedom isnt free that everybody has an obligation to the nation as a community it is not natural or inevitable that half the world goes hungry that the freedom of markets trumps protection of the planet or that citizens rights come second to those of corporations in times such as these people should recognize that evil knows no borders knows no limits and knows no compassion those around the globe that value freedom must continue to persevere even in the darkest of times to her audience janis joplin has remained a symbol artifact and reminder of late sixties youth culture her popularity never derived from her musical ability but from her capacity to link her fantasies of freedom and immortality with ours the enemies of freedom will not prevail in short is not liberty the freedom of every person to make full use of his faculties so long as he does not harm other persons while doing so how can you be conservative and justify wiretapping people without a warrant were supposed to be the party of personal freedom and civil liberties another hero was tom swift in the books what he stood for the freedom the scientific knowledge and being and engineer gave him the ability to invent solutions to problems hes always been a hero to me i buy old tom swift books now and read them to my own children real change isnt found in some new way to think about yourself but in freedom from the need to think about yourself at all its great to have the freedom to enjoy your work and not feel like youre leaving your other life behind i always wanted to make a childrens album because you have the freedom to explore so many wonderful topics and sounds the first of all commodities to be exchanged is labour and the freedom of man consists only in the exercise of the right to determine for himself in what manner his labour shall be employed and how he will dispose of its products you know you dont retreat in the defense of freedom you dont retreat in the defense of moral government and limited government you dont retreat because people are going to defend bad things if governments let themselves be fully bound by the decisions of their parliaments without protecting their own freedom to act a breakup of europe would be a more probable outcome than deeper integration it the british system is the most gigantic system of slavery the world has yet seen and therefore it is that freedom gradually disappears from every country over which england is enabled to obtain control yes we have the freedom to do what we please but it only works because we dont do everything we might please  we should exercise some degree of personal and corporate responsibility freedom of expression comes with responsibilities especially when it comes with serious implications for peace my name became known because i was one might say accidentally the target of state repression and because so many people throughout the country and other parts of the world organized around the demand for my freedom creative freedom is an imperative for me but it doesnt really exist in a hollywood game america has never seen itself as a national state like all others but rather as an experiment in human freedom and democracy i want to have the freedom to do whatever i want money buys many things the best of which is freedom you the foreign media have been the companion of my people in its long and painful journey to freedom you have spent many lives and much treasure to bring freedom to many lands that were reluctant to receive it and here you have a people who won it by themselves and need only the help to preserve it my father described this tall lady who stands in the middle of the new york harbor holding high a torch to welcome people seeking freedom in america i instantly fell in love wherever on this planet ideals of personal freedom and dignity apply there you will find the cultural inheritance of england not to mention the fact that of course terrorists hate freedom i think they do hate but believe me i dont think they sit there abstractly hating freedom people ask how does doing a film compare to doing an ad well when youre doing a commercial you dont have to sell tickets you have a captured audience which is actually completely rare and great it gives you a lot of freedom when you make a film you have to do advertisements for the film i was inspired to write this book by those who are sceptical of the power of freedom to change the world the three main sources of scepticism are first that not every people desires freedom second that democracy in certain parts of the world would be dangerous and third that there is little the worlds democracies can do to advance freedom outside their countries by helping readers understand these mechanics i hope they will appreciate why freedom is for everyone why it is essential for our security and why the free world plays a critically important role in advancing democracy around the globe believe me the drug of freedom is universally potent i am optimistic that peace can be achieved in the region because i believe that every society on earth can be free and that if freedom comes to the middle east there can be peace i take life as it happens and i give myself a lot of freedom i used to think that if i had success i would have freedom but i have less freedom now than ive ever had and what gives me satisfaction is not the jewelry and not the cars what gives me satisfaction is doing things for others like children when i went off to the army when i was 17 years old i believed in america and the rights of freedom but today i believe my government is lying to the american people and that my president george bush is a criminal without freedom of the press there can be no representative government i have a fantastic relationship with money i use it to buy my freedom three simple words  freedom justice and honesty these sum up what the liberal democrats stand for money equals freedom a man of strength and wisdom john paul became an inspiration to generations of both catholics and noncatholics throughout the world by encouraging freedom promoting peace and respecting all faiths as a child i was given the freedom to explore my passion for acting but i also grew up in a home where there were a lot of rules i didnt have yes parents if a jerk burns the flag america is not threatened democracy is not under siege freedom is not at risk i know what youre going to say they are men and men should be free a free man is dangerous to himself and everyone else freedom should be left to those who can put it to good use freedom is a muscle you have to exercise it people want the freedom they want to be able to shop if you dont like the shop trading hours and youre a shop owner you dont have to open a trait which differentiated new york from european cities was the incredible freedom and ease in which life including sexual life could be carried on on many levels school gives you the freedom to explore different philosophies religions aspects of yourself and subjects the humor is essentially dark for a cartoon and sophisticated but at the same time being a cartoon gives the writers more freedom than in a normal sitcom it always pushes the line that despite human failings the simpsons are really decent people we need international support so that our people live a life of normality of dignity of liberty and freedom i hope that our cry for freedom may be heard in terms of filming yes it really does feel over now theres a real sense of freedom now its a good time to finish i think as much as im going to miss it im ready to move on and do different things our soldiers have nobly fought to protect freedom since our countrys birth and have fought to protect those that could not protect themselves even in foreign lands when called upon to stop terrorists before the strike we must do three things deny them entry into the country curtail their freedom of action inside the country and deprive them of material and moral support from within the country i think that we could be more careful about what were saying to young women in terms of their expectations its unrealistic to expect people to always be in designer clothes girls growing up deserve more freedom in how they look and how they feel about how they look i was the youngest child and got a lot more freedom than my brother and sister i used to wander doing my own thing under the radar but i didnt get in bad bad trouble i grew up under communism so we could only learn russian and then when communism fell in 1989 we could learn a few more things and have the freedom to travel and the freedom of speech  and the freedom of dreaming really now we understand much more clearly why people from all over the world want to come to new york and to america its called freedom the balance between freedom and security is a delicate one freedom  an occupied space which must be reoccupied every day spirit borrows from matter the perceptions on which it feeds and restores them to matter in the form of movements which it has stamped with its own freedom we live in a land like no other  a land of freedom and opportunity unparalleled on the face of the globe weve got to understand that the whole nature of the way american democracy guards its freedom has been changed when public access to voting is impaired or when public confidence in voting is diluted democracy suffers and our freedom is less secure if technology has finally caught up with individual liberty why would anyone who loves freedom want to rethink that i am somebody who  im not saying im perfect but i need that freedom that ability to make mistakes out there because theres a fine line between making a mistake or being brilliant i am not an anti to anything which will bring freedom to my class we are a nation in which freedom is alive in the squares and streets in the daily work of the communications media in the open relationship between the governing and the governed if you ask me to summarise our mission i would put it this way we were a military regime that sought to lay the foundations for freedom and liberty in a complex society most importantly nothing has happened to change my conviction that freedom and the love of liberty remain the essential defining attributes of our national character as a people the challenge as we saw in the nigerian project was to restructure the economy decisively in the direction of a modern free market as an appropriate environment for cultivation of freedom and democracy and the natural emergence of a new social order while its really hard to do at the same time im escaping my body which i really want to do im living someone elses life i get very intensely into the story into the interviews and the research im experiencing things along with my subjects i have a freedom i dont have in my physical life ive never had anything but the freedom to do what i wanted just as long as it made me happy fulfill  you can far more than fulfill  the brightest anticipations of those who in the name of human freedom and in the face of threats that have ripened into terrible realities since fought that battle which placed you where you now stand the wretch who lives without freedom feels like dressing in the mud from the streets those who have you o liberty do not know you those who do not have you should not speak of you but win you i like movies that pop that have a little bit of candy on that freedom to have a little bit of extra fun but are rooted in real behaviour rooted in cause and effect never violating reality the media bring our wars home but only rarely have they been able to do it in complete freedom you make a movie for 9k for the freedom it allows you the men and women who serve in our military have won for us every hour we live in freedom sometimes at the expense of the very hours of the lifetimes they had hoped to live freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter mush that would be a mere shadow of freedom the test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order there is a bright spot or two for the spaniards french toast has become freedom toast on the air force one breakfast menu but the spanish omelet is still a spanish omelet when i was in jail i was a lot of peoples favorite person i practically ran the jail i had more freedom than the police a growing number of young women who have the freedom to decide have decided that career can wait and the delicious early years of their childrens lives cant people ask me if i ever thought of writing a childrens book i say if i had a serious brain injury i might well write a childrens book but otherwise the idea of being conscious of who youre directing the story to is anathema to me because in my view fiction is freedom and any restraints on that are intolerable to me music has to be about freedom its the most important thing in my life the very first things that i did even in theater were bad guys they are meaty roles for the most part with the bad guy you have more freedom to experiment and go further out than with a good guy without economic development any potential for political openness and freedom will be questionable our constitutional liberties shall not be sacrificed in our search for greater security for that is what our enemies and all enemies of freedom and democracy hope to achieve the main thing i believe in is freedom we must guard against the overreaching hand of big government trying to take away our freedom and we must always protect the environment in a manner consistent with our values if i am outspoken of the dangers of intemperance to members of our armed forces it is because we are all especially concerned for the welfare of those who are risking their lives in the cause of freedom what is our freedom fight about is it about the liberation of children or just having sex with them although we have in theory abolished human slavery recognized womens rights and stopped child labor we continue to enslave other species who if we simply pay attention show quite clearly that they experience parental love pain and the desire for freedom just as we do men must stop being jealous of their power and generously allow freedom and responsibility to others the reward is harmonious families and society a successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend a successful woman is one who can find such a man i believe that if life gives you lemons you should make lemonade and try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka and have a party a word to the wise aint necessary  its the stupid ones that need the advice behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes do not take life too seriously you will never get out of it alive i feel sorry for people who dont drink when they wake up in the morning thats as good as theyre going to feel all day when you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second when you sit on a redhot cinder a second seems like an hour thats relativity a day without sunshine is like you know night go to heaven for the climate hell for the company wine is constant proof that god loves us and loves to see us happy a government that robs peter to pay paul can always depend on the support of paul as a child my familys menu consisted of two choices take it or leave it get your facts first then you can distort them as you please between two evils i always pick the one i never tried before my grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty shes ninetyseven now and we dont know where the hell she is people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do my fake plants died because i did not pretend to water them i have six locks on my door all in a row when i go out i lock every other one i figure no matter how long somebody stands there picking the locks they are always locking three housework cant kill you but why take a chance if the facts dont fit the theory change the facts any girl can be glamorous all you have to do is stand still and look stupid i always wanted to be somebody but now i realize i should have been more specific a lot of people are afraid of heights not me im afraid of widths a twoyearold is kind of like having a blender but you dont have a top for it always end the name of your child with a vowel so that when you yell the name will carry weather forecast for tonight dark a womans mind is cleaner than a mans she changes it more often i found there was only one way to look thin hang out with fat people all right everyone line up alphabetically according to your height recession is when a neighbor loses his job depression is when you lose yours i cook with wine sometimes i even add it to the food im an idealist i dont know where im going but im on my way always remember that you are absolutely unique just like everyone else all generalizations are false including this one the only time a woman really succeeds in changing a man is when he is a baby i like long walks especially when they are taken by people who annoy me it takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance everybody knows how to raise children except the people who have them my most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me by all means lets be openminded but not so openminded that our brains drop out a friend doesnt go on a diet because you are fat do not worry about avoiding temptation as you grow older it will avoid you a stockbroker urged me to buy a stock that would triple its value every year i told him at my age i dont even buy green bananas frisbeetarianism is the belief that when you die your soul goes up on the roof and gets stuck i used to be snow white but i drifted you can lead a man to congress but you cant make him think i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by a child of five would understand this send someone to fetch a child of five a nickel aint worth a dime anymore i am not a member of any organized political party i am a democrat i am not afraid of death i just dont want to be there when it happens by trying we can easily endure adversity another mans i mean happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city i refuse to join any club that would have me as a member any kid will run any errand for you if you ask at bedtime anyone who says he can see through women is missing a lot i intend to live forever so far so good if two wrongs dont make a right try three a waffle is like a pancake with a syrup trap before i refuse to take your questions i have an opening statement if youre going to do something tonight that youll be sorry for tomorrow morning sleep late be thankful were not getting all the government were paying for there are only three things women need in life food water and compliments i havent spoken to my wife in years i didnt want to interrupt her a man doesnt know what he knows until he knows what he doesnt know life is hard after all it kills you all people are born alike  except republicans and democrats electricity is really just organized lightning one picture is worth 1000 denials i saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with guess on it i said thyroid problem i knew i was an unwanted baby when i saw that my bath toys were a toaster and a radio im sorry if you were right id agree with you a pessimist is a person who has had to listen to too many optimists a committee is a group that keeps minutes and loses hours my definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to the william tell overture without thinking of the lone ranger i distrust camels and anyone else who can go a week without a drink roses are red violets are blue im schizophrenic and so am i older people shouldnt eat health food they need all the preservatives they can get procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday there cannot be a crisis next week my schedule is already full guilt the gift that keeps on giving never have more children than you have car windows i would never die for my beliefs because i might be wrong why do they call it rush hour when nothing moves money wont buy happiness but it will pay the salaries of a large research staff to study the problem im writing a book ive got the page numbers

love is the answer could you please rephrase the question the world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper i wear a necklace cause i wanna know when im upside down it

personality than goldfish if man knew how women pass the time when they are alone theyd never marry here in hollywood you can actually get a marriage license printed on an etchasketch i have a very low level of recognition which is fine by me im kidding about having only a few dollars i might have a few dollars more id never been in play long enough for the flowers to die in the dressing room im the only man in the world with a marriage licence made out to whom it may concern someone told me that when they go to vermont they feel like theyre home im that way at saks trust is hard to come by thats why my circle is small and tight im kind of funny about making new friends i was asked to act when i couldnt act i was asked to sing funny face when i couldnt sing and dance with fred astaire when i couldnt dance  and do all kinds of things i wasnt prepared for then i tried like mad to cope with it there is hope for the future because god has a sense of humor and we are funny to god life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh from there to here and here to there funny things are everywhere its a funny thing that when a man hasnt anything on earth to worry about he goes off and gets married you know fame is a funny thing man especially you know actors musicians rappers rock singers its kind of a lifestyle and its easy to get caught up in it  you go to bars you go to clubs everyones doing a certain thing its tough design is a funny word some people think design means how it looks but of course if you dig deeper its really how it works forgiveness is a funny thing it warms the heart and cools the sting its funny how most people love the dead once youre dead your made for life its a funny thing about life if you refuse to accept anything but the best you very often get it but you cant focus on things that matter if all youve been is asleep for forty years funny how sleep rhymes with sheep you know i saw 28 days i dont remember rehab being like a day camp or being that funny rehab is a dumping ground its a big landfill its funny the way most people love the dead once you are dead you are made for life the most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds new discoveries is not eureka but thats funny everything is funny as long as its happening to somebody else its hard to be funny when you have to be clean im not funny what i am is brave if i studied all my life i couldnt think up half the number of funny things passed in one session of congress a mans got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book why is cloud 9 so amazing what is wrong with cloud 8 that joke came off the top of my head and the top of my head aint funny life would be tragic if it werent funny all these jokes have been preapproved as funny by me most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody elses expense and i find that thats just a form of bullying in a major way so i want to be an example that you can be funny and be kind and make people laugh without hurting somebody elses feelings i dont mean to be funny like almost everyone who uses email i receive a ton of spam every day much of it offers to help me get out of debt or get rich quick it would be funny if it werent so exciting its a funny old world im odd looking sometimes i think i look like a funny muppet it is funny that men who are supposed to be scientific cannot get themselves to realise the basic principle of physics that action and reaction are equal and opposite that when you persecute people you always rouse them to be strong and stronger i am oddlooking i sometimes think i look like a funny muppet comedy is simply a funny way of being serious god writes a lot of comedy the trouble is hes stuck with so many bad actors who dont know how to play funny screaming at children over their grades especially to the point of the childs tears is child abuse pure and simple its not funny and its not good parenting it is a crushing scarring disastrous experience for the child it isnt the least bit funny whatever is funny is subversive every joke is ultimately a custard pie a dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion i think being funny is not anyones first choice its funny how you never think about the women youve had its always the ones who get away that you cant forget it is not funny that anything else should fall down only that a man should fall down why do we laugh because it is a gravely religious matter it is the fall of man only man can be absurd for only man can be dignified to succeed in life you need three things a wishbone a backbone and a funny bone its always funny until someone gets hurt then its just hilarious you know the funny thing i dont get along with rich people i get along with the middle class and the poor people better than i get along with the rich people the best ideas come as jokes make your thinking as funny as possible i guess when you turn off the main road you have to be prepared to see some funny houses i got a lot of support from my parents thats the one thing i always appreciated they didnt tell me i was being stupid they told me i was being funny theres nothing cure or funny or lovable about being cheap its a total turnoff im blonde and tanned and normalsized im sweet shy funny have a big heart and im nice  and i like to eat i used to think that everything was just being funny but now i dont know i mean how can you tell as i get older all sorts of things become less funny once one has children any cruelty involving children becomes far less amusing than when one was at the mercy of ones friends and relatives children there is nothing funny about halloween this sarcastic festival reflects rather an infernal demand for revenge by children on the adult world i had everything id hoped for but i wasnt being myself so i decided to be honest about who i was it was strange the people who loved me for being funny suddenly didnt like me for being me its funny about men and women men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them women pay emotionally coming and going neither has it easy a funny thing happens in real estate when it comes back it comes back up like gangbusters i know some people say i can be funny but there is always a deeper meaning to what i say i am a socialist at heart and have the interests of the poor in mind when people see how i manage to work my way out of tough situations it gives them hope in their own life my grandchildren are fabulous and funny certainly there are things in life that money cant buy but its very funny  did you ever try buying then without money i could party in a cardboard box with people who are funny and dont care for me its really about who i surround myself with so i just try to always be with hilarious people chaos in the midst of chaos isnt funny but chaos in the midst of order is its a funny thing the less people have to live for the less nerve they have to risk losing nothing one of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys another sells and both think they are astute i dont care what the haters and naysayers say if they make jokes about me ill laugh because theyll probably be funny no matter how popular you are as a standup  you can go out and fill a 10000seat arena and be smart and funny  its delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that its not about you that its about the people who are nominated and respect that but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are ive always believed that there are funny people everywhere but theyre just not comedians in fact some of my best comedic inspirations were not professional entertainers i thought borat was a breakthrough comedy because it was really funny it wasnt some studioproduced script with 14 writers dirty rotten scoundrels is a good one because it not only turned out i think to be a really funny movie but it was also a delight to shoot we were in the south of france working with glenne headly and michael caine and frank oz the director  who were just fun you need to be silly to be funny you know how old i am im so old i remember when letterman used to be funny and it was presidents who were serious thats how old i am in my circle of friends ive always been loud and funny and talkative but as soon as i step out of that circle i get very quiet and introspective i dont want the spotlight on me i remember straightening my hair because i wanted to be like everybody else and now the fact that anybody would emulate what i do its just funny sixth grade was a big time in my childhood of hoops and friendship and coming up with funny things i got attention by being funny at school pretending to be retarded and jumping around with a deformed hand i think its funny to be delicate with subjects that are explosive life can be dramatic and funny all in the same day the middle class is so funny its the class i know best and its the class where you find the most pretension so thats what makes the middle classes so funny im smart and i can be really funny and interesting and i can go toetotoe with anybody in a conversation its to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business as it were and i use almost pure turpentine to start with adding oil as i go along until the medium becomes pure oil i use as little oil as i can possibly help and thats my method i had an idea of what i thought was funny its kind of based on how i am you know being relevant or coming up with something interesting funny to say about whats current is just as hard as it might ever be depending on the serendipity of it all it is funny the two things most men are proudest of is the thing that any man can do and doing does in the same way that is being drunk and being the father of their son thats what i hate about a lot of comedies when youre hitting a line or making it funny i read a lot of scripts that i just dont find very funny my hair has never been my greatest feature so that was funny enough unto itself that my hair became so focused on comediennes are the lucky ones because if youre funny you can be 125 years old and they will still accept you being funny is one of my greatest strengths i can make girls smile when theyre down and when theyre having a good time i can carry on the joke do you know its funny but i never thought of being blind as a disadvantage and i never thought of being black as a disadvantage if you play it straight its funny  the best comedy is always played straight down the middle the adjustment is understanding from the screenplay that a moment is hilarious keep your sense of humor my friend if you dont have a sense of humor it just isnt funny anymore funny is only something that others know about you  you cant be funny by yourself cheryl cole and katy perry are two of the hottest girls in the world  and so normal and funny with it if i was a few years older they are the kind of girls id like to date i want a younger version of cheryl and katy  a mixture of the two would be hot jon stewart is exactly the same guy hes always been only with money he knows that the moment he really believes hes important the funny goes away and he becomes bill oreilly except shorter and jewish stand up is really fun because if i think of a joke or a funny idea then i can just go and tell some people and if they laugh they laugh right away i think a lot of stuff i find funny is from day dreaming i think since i was kid people told me that they thought i was funny the comedians i liked were bill cosby and steven wright like just always as a comedic actor i always liked gary larson whos really funny for a cartoonist obviously its hard to lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse i wear black skinnyfit jeans  i cant get away from them its funny because i wore baggy jeans for ages then one day my friend convinced me to try on a skinny pair and i thought they were great i never smoked i never drank and i never took drugs the funny thing is nothing is more boring people like this for me its ok but most of my friends at least they smoke and drink one time i went into a restroom and a girl followed me in i signed an autograph for her in the sink it was pretty funny because she was in a guys restroom and she wasnt embarrassed at all the follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family their friends people who should be supportive going what are you talking about even just seemingly regular career paths but if its not what people expect for you they kind of react funny a good artist is willing to die many times over whats funny is ive died so many times hollywoods just not funny karaoke isnt fair when youre a comedian the whole idea is to get people laughing and enjoying themselves and im a professional funny guy its funny you succeed but now where are you gonna go from there ive got to keep proving that i can laugh or cry more real each time do i have a longterm plan kind of i have a general direction i think but its funny what comes down the pike the people i grew up around who i really liked were quick on the draw it always just wowed me and my mum would make weird funny comments i can see in myself her selfdeprecating hippie humour i cant take myself too seriously if you tell the truth about how youre feeling it becomes funny i know what germans are they are a funny people they are always choosing someone to lead them in a direction which they do not want to go i was so afraid to even read a paper in front of my classmates it is very funny because at that point my teachers would never have believed that i could speak in front of an audience of over 2000 people its funny when people say i dont think julia likes me honey if i dont like you youre going to know about it its funny how social activists usually protest against the only things that have a credible chance of achieving the activists goals if youre going to tell people the truth be funny or theyll kill you i think were all good and bad but goods not funny bad is funny suppress the good and let the bad out and then you can be funny its funny what a few nohitters do for a body as soon as you are trying to be funny or dramatic thats when things start feeling fake and boring whats funny is that the idea of popularity  even the use of the word popular  is something that had been mostly absent from my life since junior high in fact the hallmark of life after junior high seemed to be the shedding of popularity as a central concern i mean ive seen 3d films so far and i think its a long way to go before they replace actors its a funny thing with 3d i havent quite got it yet yet funny things happen to you in movies for silly reasons chris hemsworth is like christopher reeve in that he can do two things he can wear a big red cape without a shred of selfconsciousness but hes also funny as hell and hes so sweet so with all the fishoutofwater stuff hes so funny so he does almost two jobs in a way i like funny guys and those for some reason tend to be nerdy guys the nightmare is you spend the rest of your life being funny at parties and then people say why didnt you do that when you were on television the funny thing about me that most people never really understand is that at heart im really a jock i was a hoparound i hung out with the rockabilly crew the guys who were trying to be rappers the funny kids i wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning everything i buy is vintage and smells funny maybe thats why i dont have a boyfriend im a pretty funny guy and i would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys  moviestar guys where they could help me through it you cant really be strong until you see a funny side to things its only i have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now i know that im skinny because i know there are even smaller clothes in the store i think im big when i was big i never thought about it i like reading ball tongue lyrics and all that stuff and they published a book and i wouldnt give my lyrics and its all wrong in the book and i giggle its funny they say yogi berra is funny well he has a lovely wife and family a beautiful home money in the bank and he plays golf with millionaires whats funny about that i dont think im funny its funny but you get to a time in your life when you think you have all the friends you will ever have books are funny little portable pieces of thought its funny all you have to do is say something nobody understands and theyll do practically anything you want them to you have to discover when youre inadequate to be funny and you dont know youre inadequate when youre a kid i gave a funny speech at my wifes birthday party and im thinking hey ive still got it theres also a certain rhythm to the way jews talk that might be funny the funniest racism is the racism between minorities its something you dont see dramatized but almost every minority i know whos my age they have these funny stories about their parents stereotyping other minorities very often i dont make it through moments of recording because it is genuinely funny and absolutely ridiculous that a 60yearold grown man is making these noises i had the classic 40 meltdown i did its embarrassing it was pretty funny but then i recovered to me it was like a second adolescence hormonally my body was changing my mind was changing and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness life was a funny thing that happened to me on the way to the grave dont remember me as too nice or beautiful or funny because then youll be disappointed i dont like comedy i like funny things i dont like comedy like comedy movies are just oh jesus the funny thing is im not bothered or sad about being on my own  after all ive never had a husband light and funny has a more compelling quality when youre younger but i havent abandoned the genre i love falling down i love lucille ball its just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that i cant convincingly portray at this age i actually think of being funny as an odd turn of mind like a mild disability some weird way of looking at the world that you cant get rid of when i was a little kid i wrote this play about all these characters living in a haunted house there was a witch who lived there and a mummy when they were all hassling him this guy who bought the house  i cant believe i remember this  he said to them whos paying the mortgage on this haunted house i thought that was really funny sometimes i think what i write is funny in its quiet way actually i never did stand up im not that funny the funny thing is the girls that im always up against for roles are pretty nice and cool like emma watson shes awesome i love readings and my readers but the din of voices of the audience gives me stage fright and the din of voices inside whisper that i am a fraud and that the jig is up surely someone will rise up from the audience and say out loud that not only am i not funny and helpful but im annoying and a phony ive thought for the last decade or so the only actual place raw truth was seeping through in newspapers was on the comics pages they were able to pull off intelligent social comment pure truths not found elsewhere in the news pages and had the ability to make it all funny entertaining and pertinent i have only been funny about seventy four per cent of the time yes i think that is right seventyfour per cent of the time no no i was only funny on stage really i i think i was funny as a person toward my classmates when i was very young you know when i was a child up to about the age of 12 hemingway seems to be in a funny position people nowadays cant identify with him closely as a member of their own generation and he isnt yet historical i think the pattern of my essays is a funny thing happened to me on my way through finnegans wake its funny to be a critic i find it so funny that people find me so interesting great big serious novels always get awards if its a battle between a great big serious novel and a funny novel the funny novel is doomed weve seen some insane signs is that a loaf of bread in your pocket or are you just happy to see me funny stuff along those lines very original one just said i will do unspeakable things i thought that was very interesting  and mildly terrifying you know whats funny i dont ever feel the need to escape i have a strong marriage i like my life you hear about these guys having midlife crises  i dont see that happening to me i dont really get shaken very much people could heckle me a spotlight could go out i could forget a lyric im not operating on somebodys brain you know what i mean so i just think its all funny without hurting anybody we all tend to laugh at others discomfort when someone slips on a banana skin and falls its funny always remember your kids name always remember where you put your kid dont let your kid drive until their feet can reach the pedals use the right size diapers for yourself and when in doubt make funny faces i had to act in a school play when i was about ten years old i really didnt want to do it but everyone had to do it so i didnt have a choice a talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work its funny because id always known that i wanted a movie career i just didnt think that i would be in the movies im like bursting i should be working i dont want to take a break its funny on set i dont have to go to the bathroom i dont have anything wrong im perfectly fine so throughandthrough im not hungry im literally not even in my own body its a funny thing you want so badly for people to see what you do  youre proud of it  and i like the effect that movies have on people but the attention can also make me uncomfortable and i like to keep whatever is mine remaining that way its a funny little game to play and its a slippery slope i always say to myself im never going to give anything away because theres never any point or benefit for me its not an accident that both my sister and i are writers our parents created an accidental petri dish my family has great storytellers and i grew up in a very funny conversational house and didnt have television this small family farm was a bubble world that didnt have much to do with reality come out is so funny to me because ive never been in the word funny is a bit like the word love  we dont have enough words to describe the many varieties a romantic comedy has to be funny and make you think about life but the obstacle that has to be overcome is key theres something dangerous about whats funny jarring and disconcerting there is a connection between funny and scary some people can do things and get away with it comics are famously like that why is it that some guys can say the most horrible things and its not offensive its funny i always like to watch comics and its interesting that you can tell if someones funny in 10 seconds i guess now that i think back i used to play priest and be a funny priest i dont know i grew up in such a catholic family that i kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and i think i had fun watching my mom laugh comedys so subjective and if someone comes to watch doesnt get it doesnt find it funny then fine the funny thing is people wont let me pay for things ill be in a restaurant and the manager will say oh no its on the house the trick is always to write in pairs because if at least two people find it funny youve immediately halved the odds of it not being funny its not common for a woman on television especially if shes the mom of the family to be funny shes usually a straight man or foil i watch things that are fun or funny or interesting funny enough if you are looking at people these days who are putting botox in their face and getting all sorts of plastic surgery we look at them and go i can tell youve had botox i can tell youve had plastic surgery you look really strange to me but no ones saying anything were just accepting the fact that theyre strangelooking no one ever thought clint eastwood was funny but he was i mean i  its so funny i am you know i am you know a working woman out in the world but i still live with my parents half the time ive been sort of taking this very long stuttering period of moving out theres always an article coming out saying the new thing is funny women its funny i never considered that people are going to see me on the show and maybe stop me on the subway i never thought of myself as like a funny person literature has drawn a funny perimeter that other art forms havent the kind of funny irony is that a lot of people talk about ethical meat eating as if its a way to care about things but also not to alienate yourself from the rest of the world but its so much more alienating than vegetarianism im not funny people assume that because my books are funny ill be funny in real life its the inevitable disappointment of meeting me you find out in life that people really like you funny so what do you give em humor and then if you show them the other side they dont like you as much i find too that i can hide behind the idiots mask being funny and you never see the sorrow or the pain at the end of the day its got to be a good movie its got to be a funny movie and its got to make people think hey i couldnt have spent my time any better when youre out of sight for as long as i was theres a funny feeling of betrayal that comes over people when they see you again id like to do a film which is funny japanese people have a funny habit of abbreviating names i find it very easy playing bond i think hes hilarious he gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations at home in la sunday is lazy its the wife and me lying in bed with coffee watching the soup or something funny on tivo the kid will occasionally join us eventually breakfast is at a place down the street called patys and we always have some kind of great dinner  my wife makes a great roast beef what other people call dark and despairing i call funny the funny thing is that im the girl who no one sees at the beach ask anyone whos traveled with me normally im in so many layers i look like lawrence of arabia who do i like i am a big fan of french and saunders  not that that they are particularly standup i have to say but i think they have been great for women and they are of themselves just incredibly funny whether they are male or female the thing i thought about doing it was its comic relief and youve got to be funny so although i did try to sing properly it obviously has hilarious results when you cant sing i made a supreme effort not to do that thing that parents do which is to bore people without children to death by going on and on about how funny their children are so theres none of that hopefully i thought i was funny as a kid it used to be that you had to make female tv characters perfect so no one would be offended by your portrayal of women even when i started out on the office eight years ago we could write our male characters funny and flawed but not the women and now thankfully its completely different people dont want to listen to a celebrity tweeting about their charities and shows thats why comedy writers do well  we put out little funny ideas the reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks if my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor im just gonna tell her be a staff writer for a sitcom because theyll have to hire you they cant really fire you and you dont have to produce that much itll be awesome i dont hate humanity and im not interested in people who do although its funny actually some of my favorite writers really do like martin amis my dirty secret london fields is one of my favorite books ever and its indefensible but hes so funny i forgive him everything i used to say man i think id be a really good dad ill be a great provider im funny ill go on trips with them  ill do all sorts of stuff but the momming im not made for that i have a really good mom i know what she put into it its funny i do try to maintain health i started doing bikram yoga which is that hothouse yoga the 105 degrees yoga for 90 minutes its great you purge out all the sweat and youre drinking water its funny how many people will come to vegas to see your show where they might not come out to see you unless you come to their hometown its funny im a lifelong musician but because i principally play the piano its been a solitary thing our records if you have a dark sense of humor were funny but our records werent about comedy they were about protests fantasy confrontation and all that its funny how people who aint never been down there can think that america is so fair and that we should be alright its funny that the people who have their foot on our neck are telling us get up whats wrong with you its a funny show the characters are surprisingly likable given how ugly they are weve got this huge cast of characters that we can move around and over the last few seasons weve explored some of the secondary characters personal lives a bit more laurence olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts and the other way around because in a comedy you look for whats serious i think thats true sometimes things are really funny if youre absolutely earnest if youre really serious its hilarious i never know when i am being funny and the other way too i dont think you can think about that i dont think you can try to be funny some people are just funny i tend to head for whats amusing because a lot of things arent happy but usually you can find a funny side to practically anything the funny thing is dennis miller got me back into comedy im half jewish im half black i look inbetween i dress funny i play all these different styles of music on one record its like what is he doing the fans of the hunger games of the book are very passionate its funny even at my concerts there are people holding up cinna signs its funny how the music industry is enraged about the internet and the way things are copied without being paid for but you know why people steal the music because they cant afford the music its funny i can sit through the worst horror film ever made but even a quite good romantic comedy can drive me nuts lifes pretty funny when youre objectively on the outside looking at it people used to be funny about approaching me but now they seem to think im as sane as anyone whos done what ive done in movies can be you know you can touch a stick of dynamite but if you touch a venomous snake itll turn around and bite you and kill you so fast its not even funny i have this horrible sense of humor where i think discomfort is funny  partly because i experience discomfort a lot and its a way of laughing at it and getting a release i can never tell when something is funny i just have to do it onstage and find out my parents are very funny when they have to deal with anything racy or offcolor they usually pretend they dont speak english well i mean if a joke or humor is bawdy its got to be funny enough to warrant it you cant just have it bawdy or dirty just for the sake of being that  its got to be funny in this world everyone wants to know everything about you and i think thats funny im just not one of those naturally funny relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it i turned down some like it hot see how smart i am i felt i couldnt bring anything funny to it the outfit was funny i dont need to compete with the wardrobe i mean sometimes a comedian becomes an actor and they just dont deliver because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful and they get that mixed up sometimes or dont even notice that thats the thing i need to be cheered up a lot i think funny people are people who need to be cheered up boston is actually the capital of the world you didnt know that we breed smartass quippy funny people not that im one of them i just sorta sneaked in under the radar its not so much what you learn about mumbai its what you learn about yourself really its a funny old hippie thing but its true as well you find out a lot about yourself and your tolerance and about your inclusiveness i was lucky my family is wonderful and its funny because most of my best friends come from very large families so it always felt as if i had lots of siblings though in the end i had to leave them and go home i kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid i think there have always been funny women from carol burnett to joan rivers when the audience sees a woman they innately know shes worked twice as hard to get there shes had to prove that she can be the leader first and then be funny on top of it she has to emit a confidence that shes in control justin timberlake is everything and what more could you want in a person hes funny hes cute hes great he just understands i get him and he gets me and thats cool when humor can be made to alternate with melancholy one has a success but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time its just wonderful when human judgment and big data intersect there are some funny things that happen its funny when bands or younger musicians ask me so what does it take to make it well first explain to me what you mean by making it do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood i mean its funny playing music how of course you want it to do well you want them to like it but its not competitive like an election its the olympics its not a formula 1 race the billboard charts are just to show you what people like its funny how making odd noises can get you into strange situations sometimes i love things made out of animals its just so funny to think of someone saying i need a letter opener i guess ill have to kill a deer its funny  if you impersonate somebody they have no idea its them being funny it turns out is like being a bank its a confidence trick as long as everyone believes in you you are fine its funny as you live through something youre not aware of it maybe im delusional but im usually funny its not 100 but i have a pretty good batting average if joy behar or sherri shepherd was a dude theyd be off tv theyre not funny enough for dudes what if roseanne barr was a dude think wed know who she was its funny when youre a kid how you can acclimate to almost anything i sometimes lie awake at night trying to think of something funny that richard nixon said my father was always a straightup funny guy he was silly he was my inspiration as a writer or as a filmmaker you have to present yourself and part of what yourself is is what youre interested in or what you think is funny or what you think is sad or what you think is horrible people ask do you make a conscious effort not to swear  if youre doing silly stuff youre not tempted to put swearing in all the comics from my childhood who were funny without swearing were the people that influenced me what i do is quite traditional anyway i always find it kind of embarrassing kind of funny and kind of exciting in new york im recognized a lot although nobody says anything you know they stare at you just a second too long but in paris its not as commonplace to be recognized i dont think gee id like to dress this person there was a picture in us magazine it was a jersey dress and courtney love was wearing it i have this thing about courtney love this funny worship i grew up in a funny way i got to dress up in funny clothes and run around new zealand with a bow and arrow for 18 months how bad could that be it was always a fantasy of mine growing up  my favorite program was always little house on the prairie  so i always wanted to wear those looks when i was a child i wouldnt let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now whaddaya know every day im in a calico dress basically so its kind of funny something about new york man you can do more comedy there probably than you can anywhere in the world if youre interested in being funny new york is the place to go its funny with fiction  once you cut something it hasnt happened anymore i read the script for wonder boys and i said that was almost perfect it was so classy cool and funny its a really specific thing we stuck to it it turned out good and a lot of people liked it its funny that there was so much disturbance about having a catholic in the white house with kennedy and when we finally get a religion in the white house thats causing a lot of conflicts and concerns and disturbances for a lot of people its in the bush administration if you use tact you can say anything then make it funny i think chris rock at the oscars was a great example i thought that was intellectually hilarious the gap starts a war with banana republic that to me was funny id love to date somebody cool fun funny you know ive always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end im very silly as a person but quality silliness onscreen has more of an art to it harrison ford whom i was in morning glory with has mastered that dry funny better than anyone this is going to sound really funny i have a poster of zac efron on my wall i think every girl has a poster of him in their room so why not join the club im an unorthodox type of guy a funny guy  at least i think im funny and one of the things i like to do is come up with nicknames for myself hurried and worried until were buried and theres no curtain call lifes a very funny proposition after all in a funny way poems are suited to modern life theyre short theyre intense nobody has time to read a 700page book people read magazines and a poem takes less time than an article i dont have a caustic sense of humor what i find funny that humor comes from a much gentler place on the stage youre there its live theres a beginning a middle an end when something is funny you hear it right away some of the writers i admire who seem very very funny and very emotional to me can develop a closeness with the reader without giving too much of themselves away lorrie moore comes to mind as does david sedaris when they write the reader thinks that theyre being trusted as a friend i think a lot of humor is about distracting yourself pretend youre not trying to make it funny because for some reason the effort to be funny smells like sulphur in our culture its funny people often compare me to other humor essayists theyre usually quite nice comparisons i will accept those gladly but i am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other more chicky female writers and the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate queer eye for the straight guy is a form of service journalism to be successful i think it has to be a combination of a good story it has to be funny and it also needs to be packed with useful information with improv its a combination of listening and not trying to be funny for a culture that has such a problem with death we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way we see people shot killed and blown up and we find it funny and sexy and all those things but the reality of it is that every day people die and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it sometimes i feel like there are people just waiting for me to fall the funny thing is i cant give them anything i have just never been a partier even in school its funny when i saw the script in my inbox and it said sparkle i thought for real its really called sparkle i was wondering too how does jordin sparks as sparkle sound im so single its funny im usually a relationship girl i love being in love and having a partner in crime but its good to be your own partner in crime god that makes me sound like i have multiplepersonality disorder i think things are funny when the character is taking it totally seriously the word spanx was funny it made people laugh no one ever forgot it its painful for me to watch someone who isnt funny its horrifying to sit in the back and watch some guy who just totally sucks if you are a great dramatic actor then you often dont know if people are enjoying your stuff at all because they are sitting there in silence but with comedy its a simple premise if its funny people laugh if its not they dont the surprising thing is that i was not funny in high school i was always jealous of the funny kids because they always got the girls i couldnt tell a joke to save my life i dont really necessarily think im a funny guy but i like the opportunity to take on something that i dont feel im the best at doing im never afraid to try something if i think its funny and i know ill regret it if i dont here is my prescription to heal all wounds watch the film funny girl at least five times eat at least 45 chocolate bars and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex i truly believe that through a combination of nutella old pals and barbra streisand we can achieve happiness and very probably world peace my size has helped make me an amazing performer too the cliche of the funny fat friend i absolutely was that character  i am that character its a complicated bag of tools i acquired and ive put them all to work onstage it sounds funny but the 2008 olympics were something that just kind of happened and i was lucky they came at a point when i was uninjured and well prepared as a gymnast you cant ask for much more i think i have an inner confidence that my tastes are pretty simple that what i find funny finds a wide audience im not particularly intellectual or clever or minorityfocused in my creative instincts and im certainly not aware of suppressing more sophisticated ambitions funny things tend not to happen to me i am not a natural comic i need to think about things a lot before i can be even remotely amusing this may sound funny but as much as the today show matured me it also was something of a cocoon id been happy there i never went into the bosss office and pounded my fist on the desk saying give me more money give me a primetime show i think im funny because my family my siblings were funny its funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end i show them the funny part the silly part the laughing part the crazy part and then the really deep deep part where im talking from my heart to these people because ive been through everything theyve been through especially with a comedy youve got the clear cut goal of trying to make a scene funny its not like drama where youre trying to achieve some kind of emotion or trying to further the story along youre trying to figure out whats the funniest way to do something ive started looking at my own father a bit funny he assures me though that i really am the son of a scottish postman i dont know now if im funny i just keep talking and hope that i hit something thats funny in terms of the creative side of it its really been a thing where you come up with the funny stuff is usually at a bar or out talking to people or whatever its funny because i think a lot of it is simply weve never considered ourselves satirists but because were on comedy central and because were south park on comedy central we can do any topic we want no writing musicals is the hardest thing in the world and it was really funny because i remember when the south park movie came out there were some critics that said well its obvious that in order to get it to be 90 minutes they filled some time with music nothings funny about someone whos successful tv is easier its all planned out for you and the audience is there to see a show and they are all pumped up but when you are in a comedy club you have to be really funny to win them over its funny because im a sucker for glitz and glitter when it comes to clothes and nail polish but with my makeup im more comfortable with a natural look it feels more like me its funny because its funny im on so late im definitely the last seconds of anyones attention so i just want to give them something dumb to laugh at so they go thats funny then fall asleep i recently spent quite a bit of time in sheffield england which is where im from i wouldnt move back there but its funny when you spend a bit of time in the place where you were brought up you kind of realize how that place has had quite a big effect on you or made you a certain way i listen like mad to any conversation taking place next to me just trying to hear why this is funny womens restrooms are especially great i wash my hands twice waiting for people to come in and start talking i dont just try to be funny its harder to be funny if youre handsome than if youre very normallooking its just more relatable youre the underdog i mean its funny to see people struggle and you dont buy that brad pitt is struggling you know that guy could be the most skillless guy in the world but if you look like that you will be fine for the rest of your life its funny because i never think of myself as little miss alltogether when i was a kid i didnt feel like i fit in because  this is really silly and i probably shouldnt say it but i didnt think anything was funny so i used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my stepdad at the time and i didnt think anything was funny i couldnt laugh i realized my family was funny because nobody ever wanted to leave our house you know what i never really factor hollywood into anything im a black actor so i cant really control what hollywood thinks i gotta go do my thing and my jokes have got to be funny whatever i do has got to be great i really wanted to just be a musician i didnt want to be anything else but i was funny and all that for years i used to bore my wife over lunch with stories about funny incidents movies these days have made killers into funny people whats that all about ive got kids and family and friends and i dont like bad things i dont think theyre funny and its irresponsible to make movies that dont show you how thats not good i tell you its funny because the only time i think about hiv is when i have to take my medicine twice a day a comedians body is funny as well as his mind being funny his whole personage is funny i want to be in funny girl and i want ryan murphy to direct it it would be pretty funny to see a beverly hills white girl with mad rap skills being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you you feel that you mustnt get serious with people they dont expect it from you and they dont want to see it youre not entitled to be serious youre a clown comedy is not funny comedy is hard work and timing and lots and lots of rehearsals thats why i like to get out there and get people to see the other side of mitt and know us in a different reflection when you see the family and how funny he is with the boys and with the grandkids and you know just what a super guy he is thats part of what i am doing is letting people see the other side of mitt funny is funny memories are doing funny things to us my dad loved to laugh he was very funny and very silly europe is scooters europe is five young people on one bench sharing a chocolate bar their idea of entertainment and fun is so much different than ours which is exactly why a movie about them would be funny so thats why one of my rules of parody writing is that its gotta be funny regardless of whether you know the source material it has to work on its own merit people never ask people doing serious music do you ever think about doing funny music ive never really understood that its a funny thing people sometimes accuse us of condescending to our characters somehowthat to me is kind of inexplicable ninetyeight per cent of laughter is nothing to do with jokes which do not deserve to bear the weight of all the funny stuff in the world the history of the relationship between comedy and swimming is short indeed of course it is always funny when someone falls into water but thats about it married with children was racy it was sexist it was a lot of things but mostly it was funny my mother was a terrific force in my life wartimegeneration woman hadnt gone to university but should have done was very funny very verbal very clever very witty i was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible i felt i was deliberately being encouraged and i was overwhelmed its funny recently ive started to notice peoples impersonations of me and its basically like a hyperactive child its funny i actually made poorer decisions when i sobered up then when i was screwed up its funny having the same name as someone me emma watson and emma stone the amount of times ive been called emma watson or emma stone is so funny its just cause were all named emma none of us look alike i dont really have a type of guy i like its just like nice guys cute boys i mean ones that are funny but i think kiss kiss bang bang really got that thing where if a movie reads really funny and then has some dramatic or violent or sinister stuff in it you cant forget that primarily it has to be even funnier than you read it or that other stuff doesnt work i wish i could be as thin as jessica simpson i think she looks gorgeous i have had jessica on my show several times and i can tell you that girl is genuine and funny with a great selfdeprecating sense of humor and at the time it is funny how you can look at something and say for example with my shoulder injury when it first happened i said this is the worst thing that could happen to me why me why now now i look back and say it was probably the best thing that happened to me i think were the only jokeless show on television i mean really we have no setups and no punch lines its not a joke show there are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human weve got a bunch of new writers now who tell me they grew up watching the simpsons its bizarre and theyre writing some very funny stuff sometimes people get mad at the simpsons subversive story telling but theres another message in there which is a celebration of making wild funny stories i can always get better a lot of my exgirlfriends dont think im funny i didnt plan to be the rude middleclass comedian you write a certain type of joke that you find funny and mine happen to be often rude yes its juvenile but thats me only bad golfers are lucky theyre the ones bouncing balls off trees curbs turtles and cars good golfers have bad luck when you hit the ball straight a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky music is more difficult  try naming a political band the dead kennedys the dead kennedys are political but they are more funny than they are political we sit in a room for months trying to think of funny things i love a smart wellwritten show and 30 rock well you cant get any better than that tina fey poos funny theres nothing that she does that isnt funny that show is an example of how brilliant she is its so smart theyve done some brilliant commentary about the housewives with queen of jordan their showwithintheshow i am accusing him of stealing my best material he was a very funny man its unbearable when someone changes around you just imagine that your life partner changes then it is difficult to cope with or your mother or your father they were strong and now theyre like a baby  its not so funny funny games was conceived as a provocation my other films are different if people feel my other films are or respond to them as provocation then thats quite different funny games is the only one of mine where my intention was to provoke the audience when i first envisioned funny games in the mid1990s it was my intention to have an american audience watch the movie it is a reaction to a certain american cinema its violence its naivety the way american cinema toys with human beings in many american films violence is made consumable i have an inability to enjoy things but thats why were in comedy if we were happy we wouldnt be funny i guess for years its driven me crazy that women dont have better roles especially in comedies i know so many funny women but i always felt misogynist streak is too strong a term  but a dismissiveness i love funny people and when im with funny people or people who are amusing in their weirdness i love it because that to me is funny as opposed to someone who stops and says hey let me tell you a joke whats so great about working with really funny women is that vanity comes second whatever makes it real and funny theyre going to go for and its just great what i dont like is when i see stuff that i know has had a lot of improv done or is playing around where theres no purpose to the scene other than to just be funny what you dont want is funny scene funny scene funny scene and now heres the epiphany scene and then the movies over womens humor seems to be a little more supportive its just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people i respond to that i feel less like im going to get beat up in a room full of women than i do in a room full of guys its funny when people say you have sex appeal or call you the next brad pitt i just laugh im not that i dont want to be that by no means do i want to be a piece of meat for the rest of my career its funny when you get asked to do a talk show and then they follow it up with requesting you take your shirt off see i dont really go after girls most of the girlfriends ive had have come after me so its really funny when girls get offended because i dont hit on them its interesting that whenever i meet some of the other bond girls i always have something in common and it is an interesting sorority we all share about our bonds did your bond do that yes mine did so it is quite funny conversations we may as well be in high school you know stephen says in the movies no one ever goes to the bathroom they shave they brush their teeth he goes right at this sort of funny taboo we have about the bathroom and he turned it into this nightmare you know your worst fear of whats in there funny is an attitude my main point is to be funny if i can slip a message in there fine things can be funny only when we are in fun when were dead earnest humor is the only thing that is dead funny is not a color being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone i dont believe that anybody has come to a conclusion on why something is funny its funny because its ridiculous and its ridiculous for different reasons at different times there are so many funny women in the world and there has been for so many years so ill be happy when people can just move on from that and things can just be comedies and not female or male and everyone gets an equal opportunity but if something funny happens i cant resist i have to tell the people i would like to do something modern and possibly funny ive always enjoyed making people laugh but in order for me to be funny i have to get ticked off about something everyone comes up to me saying cooee julie hello as if i know them of course i dont bloody know them am i flummoxed by it sometimes i think ooh love go easy for a time i did feel this pressure that i had to be funny but it passes oh all the time when victoria wood and i did our series there were people asking can women be funny people still ask that its like asking can women breathe in and out i was the little funny one i felt i was the child among grown women its a real primal thing watching someone get hurt its funny and accessible its a funny thing  when im crazed with work spending time with my children relaxes me yet at the end of a long weekend with them the very thing i need to relax is a little work and time away from them its really funny because the same people who loved me as stringer bell were the same people that were watching daddys little girls literally in tears i had seen movies before that that had made me laugh but i had never seen anything even remotely close to as funny as richard pryor was just standing there talking i wouldnt totally rule out doing letterman or the tonight show if i had a set that i just happened to write that i thought was funny but was still appropriate for network censors but im not going to go out of my way the audience changes every night youre the same person you have to speak your mind and do the stuff that you think is funny and makes you laugh the misconception is that standup comics are always on i dont know any really funny comics that are annoying and constantly trying to be funny all the time i used to say i wanted somebody funny and intelligent but kindness is the most important quality in a man the great thing is that the funny side of getting old is fuel for my comedy i think its always funny when you see kids do shakespeare but with comedy its a simple premise if its funny people laugh if its not they dont hitchcock had a charm about him he was very funny at times he was incredibly brilliant in his field of suspense one lion thinks its just hilarious to tackle us hes very funny about it and we always know when it will happen working with chaplin was very amusing and strange his films are so funny but working with him i found him to be a very serious man whereas the films of hitchcock are macabre he could be a very funny man to work with always telling jokes and holding court of course when i worked with charlie he was getting older i actually find novels that are determined to be funny at every turn quite oppressive its funny though with films because you can incorporate a variety of elements and sometimes that can work for you and sometimes i think it can work against you comedians dont laugh theyre too busy analyzing why its funny or not what was really funny is that as i got older all those guys who called me a sissy in junior high school wanted me to be their best friend because they wanted to meet all the girls that i knew in figure skating i cant not find humor in elements of most parts of life but at the same time nothing ever seems perpetually funny to me and in a funny way each death is different and you mourn each death differently and each death brings back the death you mourned earlier and you get into a bit of a pileup also in a funny way if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies people often ask me how i make things funny i dont make things funny if you work at comedy too laboriously you can kill whats funny in the joke for some reason and i dont know why but i dont think that im funny in california so i always want to do my movies east somewhere i took ps i love you thinking it was going to be a little funny and i ended up crying every day on that film i think saturday night live starting in the 1970s really gave women an outlet to be funny a lot of those women went on to have film careers from kristen wiig now to tina fey and gilda radner i write about wounds the eternal treasons of life its not very funny but its sincere my commitment is to sincerity when i was doing ensemble theater and comedy work i felt i had some talents but when i started doing my shows in berkeley and found that i could be funny on my own i was shocked memory is funny once you hit a vein the problem is not how to remember but how to control the flow people just dont laugh when their family is violated and you dont shrug it off you band together and you defend together its a funny primitive instinct theres always something funny about men chasing women i dont know who the hell paul lynde is or why hes funny and i prefer it to be a mystery to me politicians talk in generalities and lies and i think theyve caused all our grief theyre so awful theyre really funny i hate thinking this because my dad loved politics as soon as i realized you could be funny as a job that was the job i wanted i think when you do comedy you play by a different set of rules no one really wants you to be in that good shape being in good shape implies a level of vanity that isnt necessarily funny to me what separates a funny movie from a good movie is something personal i cant watch other people doing comedy as soon as somebody starts being funny i have to turn off because it upsets me i get comedy indigestion i just hate anybody else being funny thats my job as a fiveyearold in berlin in 1965 i didnt know that funny women existed it wasnt until i got back to england that i realised women could be funny leno conan they are both really funny they really know how to land one straight men just cant imagine the bliss of being in a relationship with someone who finds farting as funny as they do we live in a funny time if you dont go corporate you cant compete youre relegated as irrelevant people used to admire that you cant teach somebody how to be funny youre either funny or you aint the things that make me angry still make me angry george carlin is 67 and hes still as funny as hes ever been and hes still angry and that makes me feel good because i feel like if i stick around long enough ill still be able to work the fact that the kardashians could be more popular than a show like mad men is disgusting its a super disgusting part of our culture but i still find it funny to make a joke about it funny people is my favorite performance of myself to date even though its a comedy and there are serious moments i really felt like leo felt like a real person it didnt feel like i was playing myself whether its a comedy or drama i just try to make it as realistic as possible i dont want to be the one to break it to you but the future aint that funny twitter to me works if youre funny twitter doesnt work as a promotional tool unless you do it very very very occasionally ive been to many funerals of funny people and theyre some of the funniest days youll ever have because the emotions run high i think a lot of times on tv we see caricatures  thats whats funny i love being a dad it keeps me fit and inspired and children are so funny they always supply you with acting material its funny how most activists are pacifists ive always been part of comedy one of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other particularly my two brothers and myself when my father was upset with something youd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh because when he didnt laugh you were in trouble so what i do now is to preempt that by making the up into a virtue and telling funny stories about how crap i am before people have a chance to notice it for themselves and think maybe i havent realised if you think somethings funny go with that most comedians pull jokes from a place of honesty funny is funny is funny i really dont know what makes a comedian i think its a family background and environment yet if you put the same ingredients in another person he may never utter a funny line you can go to a play that is enjoyable because its funny and then on the next night you can go to a play thats enjoyable because its disturbing i dont happen to have a sense of humor personally so i dont know whats funny about a character this happens to be a feature of my life generally i was making my living from a joke about my appearance that i didnt understand and in a way still dont because when i look in a mirror it doesnt seem funny to me for some reason people find me funny its quite hard to define why a thought is funny its even harder to define why a person would be funny its a word that i cant define at all but whether i know quite what it is or not i seem to be it we all know funny people who cant get it down on the page  even funny writers who cant get it down on the page if its inappropriate to write about if theres nothing funny about it then its not funny its funny how a chubby kid can just be having fun and people call it entertainment sometimes comics will make the observation that its not jokes that are funny its characters that are funny and isnt that true thats why i always kill jokes im terrible at them because i get the joke right but i cant get the character right and it just goes down like a lead balloon i would call it a comedy variety show we have some people just doing straight standup we usually try to have one musical act of sort so its just people being funny in different ways not just sketch not just standup not just characters all of those things animals are sentient intelligent perceptive funny and entertaining we owe them a duty of care as we do to children strange questions are the more interesting ones children by and large dont try to trip you up they want to find out how you do this funny thing that you do if theyve loved a story they love to know how it started its so funny because right now im very tired and my brains a little dead i tend to get very focused and serious so im probably coming off a lot more like scully right now i tend to play characters that i can infuse with certain kinds of humour even the baddest guy can be funny in his own particular way i want the audience to engage with the character on some deeper level so that they leave the cinema still thinking about him its a required part of your film history to know who woody is his movies are so wonderful and not just funny but so insightful about human behavior i have no idea what im going to say when i stand up to give a toast but i do know that anything i say i find funny you know whats funny to me attitude some people say funny things but i say things funny we are supposed to enjoy the good stuff now while we can with the people we love life has a funny way of teaching us that lesson over and over again i also think if youre an actor and you can improvise when you go on an audition and you can improvise youre just a genius if you can you know take a tide commercial and you can just say one funny line thats not in the commercial they think youre a genius most of the gaffes ive made have not been funny  theyve been stupid my little dog he did not get ill it is so funny that people get ill on a boat and dogs do not who knew rob lowe was funny on parks and rec weve got some of the funniest comedy writers some of the funniest comedians in the world working there and if anything we dont just effuse to one another and be like oh rob lowes really funny if he wasnt the american audience has really opened up to women being a funny and b kinda crude bridesmaids is rrated and i think it was a major coup for women to have an rrated comedy that did really well same as bad teacher its interesting  i always thought when i was doing more melodramatic stuff like everwood that the directors were constantly reeling me in and stopping me from being funny the key is just to ignore the pain because physical comedy only works if you see someone get hurt and they arent actually hurt if someone gets hit in the face with a bat falls down and gets back up its funny if they stay down and their jaw is wired shut in the next scene its really tragic and weird you have to pretend it doesnt hurt its a funny relationship that makeup artists have i always feel kind of like a dentist people look at me and think of pain i love charlie billy burkes character writing for him is so spectacular hes so funny and wry and every scene hes in he just takes theres a scene in eclipse where bella tells him shes a virgin and its the funniest most awkward scene ive ever seen on film its funny how i use social media because i dont use it to promote my restaurants that much i use it for social issues and i think thats what its for i do a few things  i mess around with music a lot because thats a passion of mine if something strikes me and i want to share it i do he is very dry but also very funny i think people tend to feel odd when i do my act unless you are an ironic person its not a good place for you to be you know the funny thing about lorne and that show is that you can go over one million things but in a business of bean counters he still likes to laugh at small things and creates a show around it everybodys funny in different ways marie antoinette was funny im sure she was just misinterpreted you know the let them eat cake line she seems like she was kind of funny like a chelsea handler or kathy griffin type you cant make everybody laugh you gotta just do what you think is funny just be obstreperous to everybody you know how it is with writing you just write what you want to write theres no way to predict what is good or bad you just do what you think is funny and either it works or youre finished its impossible to predict anything ive dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do but these things have become part of my process i think the things i do for my appearance help make me look better i even colour my hair because i like how it makes me look im terrible at practical jokes i do them too well so theyre not funny i end up saying oh no im joking im joking everybodys funny if you love them people dont realize that im really funny and im an excellent bridge player people say funny things all the time during really serious moments in life i had a very funny family i think i would say the kings speech is surprisingly funny in fact the audiences in london toronto la new york commented theres more laughter in this film than in most comedies while it is also a moving tearjerker with an uplifting ending the funny thing is that i write and i act a lot about being jewish but i dont really think about it as a regular person its funny when people talk about the 70s i can tell you the year of every album but when it comes to the later efforts i cant remember the exact years its funny isnt it ive always found it easier to be funny than to be serious and the funny thing is ive always been an optimist  its practically a congenital disorder with me its funny how intimate it feels to get a text i knew exactly what to do on alien it was funny i come more to scotland than i ever used to so i feel more connected to it more part of the zeitgeist you know when you realize you have a choice and im choosing my homeland its funny when you get older these things creep up to you its funny because when youre younger youre in a rush to be 18 or 21 or whatever but then you hit 30 and now the days go by like hours you think 40 man this could be the halfway point it could be the threequarters point you know who knows im one of those hovering mothers and i know its really important to have an independent child so im trying to back off but its hard i love him so much and hes so funny and cute to me i actually was class clown but i dont know how that happened because ive never been considered an outwardly funny personas the people in this room will attest i actually was class clown but i dont know how that happened because ive never been considered an outwardly funny person comedy is surprises so if youre intending to make somebody laugh and they dont laugh thats funny scream was great for what it was for a horror film it was intelligent it was funny it took a laugh at itself when i was a kid i wanted to be serious like daniel daylewis no one really dreams of being a comic actor do they now i realise how stupid that is  and its because comic acting isnt taken seriously enough its a discipline you know instantly  either youre funny and getting the laughs or youre not i think theres something in the fact that its hard to be good looking and funny you have to have an oddball quality people have to sympathise with you to find you funny one of the things i like about acting is that in a funny way i come back to myself for a catholic kid in parochial school the only way to survive the beatings  by classmates not the nuns  was to be the funny guy its sort of an action flick you cant be that funny trying to steal diamonds i do find comedy difficult i dont know why maybe i think about it too much theres a tremendous amount of pressure to be funny i think sometimes my humor is extremely dry and a lot of times i would say things that i thought were very funny but i have a reputation of  people think of me as a very fundamentalist humorless fellow i dont dismiss the music that i was involved with i dont think it was a joke i dont think it was funny or a phase i dont think it was just something i was doing back then to me it was who i am it connects all the way through i dont distance myself from any of it even as a kid i was never the generator of humor but i always knew who was funny who to hang out with in italy i had an afro and a lot of the kids came up and felt my hair it really was funny i wish i had understood italian i think a lot comes from having the experience of doing standup comedy it allows you to figure out the psychology of an audience what things are funny and not life is funny and it is interesting how we make it as serious as possible its funny though speaking of fathers and sons because me and john goodman played father and son like five or six years ago in the film death sentence and i got back with him again in inside llewyn davis its funny that i got to do on the road because the thing that had the biggest impact on me growing up was reading books i was very inspired by the book and this spirit of dean moriarty and how envious we all are of somebody who can be that carefree its funny  i read that women look to chiseledfaced guys for onenight stands and to roundfaced guys for marriage when im rounder in the face i like to say this is my longterm look or this is my wifeandkids look right here this is the great thing about northern ireland i walk down the street and people stop me and say things like i know you youre that wee golfer arent you i say yeah thats me they say keep it up wee man its very funny and thats why i want to stay here as long as possible i have an alljapanese design team and none of them speak english so its often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation the most important thing is to write material that you think is funny if you dont think its funny but youre convinced that other people will think it is well they wont when it comes to war we focus more on the mainstream coverage of the event rather than the event itself people dying is never funny protest puppets are always funny i think that obama is very cool and i think hes clever and i think he can be witty but i dont think hes funny in either the way that reagan was funny  or john mccain and dick cheney are both funny in that ruthless kind of mean way we want to be funny we want to make people laugh well do whatever it takes but sooner or later id love to do a comedy i mean i think that you know people dont think that thats in my wheelhouse because ive sort of played a lot of dramatic stuff and thats certainly a side of myself that i want at some point in the right context in the right stuff that i find really funny i love nerds comiccon junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow isnt that funny the tables have turned i think the cold war works as a great analogy or simile for different kinds of conflict its funny when you look back at it its one of the last times that the boundaries were clear now as we see on homeland there are no clear boundaries and enemies i always just wanted to be funny i never really planned to be scary i started writing when i was 9 years old i was like this weird kid who would just stay in my room typing little funny magazines and drawing comic strips the token gay character is always so funny and so fantastic thats happened a lot or theyre often purely victims you cant be funny if you dont have good material i have funny bones if theres ever any kind of tension ill always be the one to try and be funny to loosen things up its funny  nowadays people that are famous get chased by paparazzi they have this fame but they dont have the money to hide from it being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone a broader character that i try to humanize a kind of silly or wacky persona that i try to fill in you cant be funny for funnys sake you try to get as outrageous situation as you can but it always has to be believable and based in real character motivations and what people would really do its funny because i sometimes feel that im most creative when im pregnant johnny rotten hes a big fan of mine i used to see him out in the audience in england and hed stand up and holler hes funny smart too and a nice guy dont think hes a jerk because he isnt if people want to compete for leadership of a religious group they can compete in piety a chilling thought or funny back in the 70s like one of my favorite movies ever was the bad news bears and that was a kids movie but i dont think of it that way i think of it as just a great movie because walter matthau was so funny and so harsh with those kids i just couldnt go back to suddenly susan after david stricklands suicide i didnt see how we could make the show light and funny any more its funny now how much we look at  whatever you want to call it art design culture stuff film  online and how in the online world youre instantly global one can always come up with funny lists and jokes you know what i take it back not everyone can always come up with funny lists and some jokes im very lucky to have a gift where i can do that pretty ably people forget how outcast they might be giants can be they have a reputation for writing really deft funny clever melodies and they also make a lot of music for kids which is terrific but when you see them in concert they can rock the house its so funny looking back but my socalled overnight success actually took 15 years i remember when i didnt have any money and my only car was moms hyundai mmmm the comedy that matters is the comedy you pull out of thin air its a bit like when something funny has happened and you try to explain it to someone else and end up saying you had to be there plus i love comic writing nothing satisfies me more than finding a funny way to phrase something its funny because im a man of strong opinions and when i make one i stand by it even if it starts to appear incorrect to me after a while i think i have a dark view of the world i have to make everything funny otherwise it all seems so sad its sad and upsetting when you see somebody crying hysterically but at the same time its real funny well in the book carrie was my alter ego in real life sarah jessica and i dont look anything alike but people do say that we sound alike sarah jessica is an adorable girl and she is very funny i think if actors dont think of themselves as funny in real life they think they cant do comedy i joke around a lot about the manic times because theyre funny we manics do outrageous things and it is part of our colorful nature i like all jim carrey films theyre really funny yes i believe blue material is funny but if thats all youve got youre dead in the water its not good im not a very serious person you know how they say that clowns are very funny in public and are really sad at home im really kind of stupid at home and more serious in public its funny because i did all of these interviews as soon as i had the baby and they were asking questions and i really didnt have an idea of anything because i was so blurry thats a funny thing fame people definitely do treat you differently when you begin to be successful people say dont go changing well thats easy to say but the fact is you dont change at all  other people do i tell girls all the time that the men that have fallen in love with me have all fallen during a man repeller stage funny how life works out like that i think its really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there its funny to me that were expected to keep quiet just because of who we are why do i lose my right to speak my mind because im famous im not a movie guy im not a tv sitcom guy but whatever seems to fit and is funny is good for me you have to understand the tone of the movie because if its supposed to be funny it can be funny violent like the home alone stuff but you have to really understand the tone of what youre doing and make the action work for that and for the character i really love soapdish i wish soapdish had more of a moment because i felt that that is a really strong funny movie kevin kline is hilarious in that movie i dont know i think its funny i think its funny i go what its so absurd im alone its funny that all these goths paint their faces with such white makeup and that is the actual colour of my skin i am that pale to this day ive found that it doesnt matter what a guy looks like if hes really funny his sense of humor makes him attractive on the other hand you dont hear men saying no shes not pretty but is she ever funny everything seems fine until youre about 40 then something is definitely beginning to go wrong and you look in the mirror with your old habit of thinking while i accept that everyone grows old and dies its a funny thing but im an exception to that rule its funny but when i arrived in california to start college i was much more interested in becoming a surfer and cruise along in life from one beach to the next i didnt plan out any huge career for myself i was going through a little bit of turbulence in my career and so its funny how turbulence itself will make you hold onto something for security and so the only thing i knew is trust in the lord and lean not unto your own heart in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path i actually feel like for a lot of my career i wasnt able to show my comedic range i did a lot of dramas and dramedies i was on er thats not generally thought of as a funny show i have an older sister named haley and she wanted to be an actress so i wanted to be an actress its really funny the way that some people dont give kids enough credit for like really being driven and really wanting to do things so badly if im in something funny i like to try and find some kind of serious line in it that people can relate to if you could cross a lion and a monkey thats what id be because monkeys are funny and lions are strong im good at coming up with wacky characters and funny dialogue comedy clubs can be brutal those people are for real and if you arent funny they arent laughing they dont care who you are gotta stay in the gym stay funny stay sharp i just love working i think its actually a misperception that i am a comedic actress i do more drama than comedy but very little of it has been seen when you are in big funny movies and they do well and your little part in it kind of explodes people perceive you as a comedian i dont think of myself as a comedian but as an artist a scientist and chemist who just happens to be funny i started doing standup to add another level to my game i feel that im a young rookie with a veterans skill i feel cheesy when i see silver spoons some of it was funny but some of it was just cheese my kids love it but i look at it and cringe ive got to get on myself to be sharp funny and loose sometimes i am so dry that people dont know im kidding and think im being serious i enjoy this because their reactions are often funny i would love to play funny girl or evita but i idolize the women who have played those parts i dont know if there needs to be another version of those shows i understand a woman who validates herself by getting attention from the opposite sex i have a friend who is that to a t doesnt mean she isnt a good person thats a funny character to play at school i was very shy i wasnt funny really i love weird or funny or beautiful sentences joy williams could write a microwaveoven manual and im sure id love it because the sentences would be tuned up like music i remember listening to the radio as a kid and finding that the songs always made me feel more peaceful funny but the more hurtin the music was the better it made me feel i think of that now when i write my songs i may not be feelin the blues myself but im writing them for other people who have a hard life what was funny if you were there is that we were all immensely sophisticated people who knew exactly what she was going to say and were chatting away nice to see you im so unprofessional on set its not even funny its funny that it all becomes about clothes its bizarre you work your butt off and then you win an award and its all about your dress you cant get away from it i follow the most random people on twitter i follow famous people like khloe kardashian who surprisingly makes really funny tweets all the time i was not particularly bright i wasnt very athletic i was a little too tall odd funny looking i was just really weird as a kid i think its so funny when people think they cant control a movie star they can were just women you know i always approach comedy roles pretending they arent funny i feel funny about owning art i dont really want to say wow come and see my monet  its in a dark room at the bottom of my cellar i love mikhail bulgakov he is very original and takes the story to unexpected places i didnt realise political writing could be so funny and theres a visceral fun in watching team america and making it like taking a puppet and throwing it against the wall because its not cg theres something funny about it so often i read scripts and am like this would never happen in real life its not trying to be funny its trying to be serious acting is all about big hair and funny props all the great actors knew it olivier knew it brando knew it billy crystal knows how to make people laugh hes got 30 years on stage theres no telling him whats funny im not a believer in the pratfall i dont think its funny just to have someone fall down they did that little thing on south park and they mentioned my name and had a character of me judging a halloween contest it was really funnythat made me the coolest aunt on earth theres a constant flow of child actors its kind of funny to watch the new crew come through i think you poor little things youre going to have to struggle for a long time its funny growing up there was never anybody around me with any kind of artistic bent when i was in college i was in the theater department which for anyone who has been involved in any kind of theater program you know that its really wacky and tightknit a real family me and my good friends from college would do random shows and plays that were sometimes serious but most of the time really goofy and funny with portlandia i dont think our intention is always to find something funny sometimes the humor comes from taking something really seriously were okay with making somebody feel uncomfortable or uneasy i got to play with nintendos wii yes its a funny name and not very revolutionary but it was fun whipping your arms around jon stewart hires people that he thinks are funny thats it thats the only requirement it is possible in this world to be pretty and funny and successful all at the same time i think its always funny when somebody thinks youre going to do something super sexy and then you dont sometimes in the most tragic situation something just profoundly funny happens and i think that being able to make people laugh and write a book thats funny makes the information go down a lot easier and it makes it a lot more fun to read easier to understand and often stronger so theres all kinds of advantages to it it is funny what a year can do its funny in a way the actor is a writer its not like the two things are so separate as to be like apples and oranges the writer and the actor are one stealing youll go far in life actually there is something funny about getting away with it movies dont look hard but figuring it out getting the shape of it getting everybodys character right and having it be funny make sense and be romantic its creating a puzzle yes having been a writer for so long i have an awareness of when things are going awry but it doesnt mean i know how to fix them i can do comedy so people want me to do that but the other side of comedy is depression deep deep depression is the flip side of comedy casting agents dont realize it but in order to be funny you have to have that other side whats funny is my husband doesnt have any tattoos at all so he must be the very conservative one i watched a lot of silent directors who were absolutely great like john ford and fritz lang tod browning and also some very modern directors like the coen brothers the directors take the freedom within their own movies to be melodramatic or funny when they chose to be they do whatever they want and they dont care about the genre what i fell in love with as a child was my fair lady funny face american in paris and singin in the rain just perfect movies to me and i was dancing i started ballet when i was three and i fell in love with those movies and fell in love with audrey hepburn and leslie caron my job is mostly to entertain and be funny sometimes you have to take the focus off of you and put it on someone else and its funny what you can accomplish and how much strength you really have i dont think i was funny until college i lived with some harvard mdphd students  they were so smart and what i contributed to the house was i was the funny one when i was younger i wanted to be a big movie star whod get to be funny on talk shows and then i wanted to retire and write science fiction when you are not treated seriously you develop comically its sense of oneself is so fractured and fragile that its like the pickedon kid who has to become funny i got pregnant at 40 by surprise its funny because when we found out we were pregnant i said okay lets experience that you just have to just go with it because its rare billy is a funny cheeky lovely boy and i love being with him parenthood is terrifying though i can barely walk past a building without panicking that its going to collapse on his head the funny thing is the songs that people think are about me probably arent and the songs that are probably are the ones they wouldnt think so thats where it kind of is funny funny i dont feel any more powerful today than yesterday the islam of the 18th 19th and first half of the 20th century was a poor thing nobody bothered about it islam was that funny sort of pure system of beliefs that depressed people in the middle east held as their religion most of my ideas just come out funny sometimes laughing isnt the best judge of whats funny cause i think theres a lot of things that are really funny that dont make you laugh that dont make you physically audibly make a noise but is something that is much more powerful than that there is nothing funny about a welladjusted intelligent person making the right choices im always in situations where you cant be funny and yet i want to do it anyway its a funny thing about me i dont have any interest in food most of the time now although when i was a kid i was always hungry i wasnt even 20 at the time but it taught me something about drugs they can take a good man a warm funny loving family man and turn him into a loser and worse i believe in a funny way the job of the novelist is to be out there on the fringes and speaking for an experience that has not really been spoken for funny how moms can tell you what to do no matter how old or big you are i didnt grow up identifying with beauty i grew up thinking i could be smart and funny  those are the things i got feedback on inappropriateness is funny to me rudeness is hilarious i think if they put a laugh track on intervention it would be funny we all know how funny morrissey is actually you know what i say that sarcastically his songs are some of the funniest songs ive ever heard in my life i mean really i mean not that the girlfriend in a coma is like really funny when i was in high school i used to sit by myself in the cafeteria  not necessarily by choice  but i thought it was funny to talk to people that werent there laughter is involuntary if its funny you laugh whats funny about that is when i was writing twilight just for myself and not thinking of it as a book i was not thinking about publishing and yet at the same time i was casting it in my head because when i read books i see them very visually i auditioned for a solo in church and got it i was about seven and i sang a song called jesus i heard you had a big house and i remember people standing up at the end and me thinking oh i think im going to like this thats how it all began sounds funny to say you got your start in church but i did its so different when you change your hair color youre treated so differently its a very funny experience its fun  i love changing up my hair im a big fan of certain new acts i love any genre of music and i think its really great to see that there are new artists coming through its kinda funny to think that im like the old man on campus now but im really happy for groups like one direction i think theyre really good guys when i turned about 12 or 13 i realised that being funny wasnt about remembering jokes it was about creating them theyre great girls theyre very funny theyre very smart theyre fun to be with theyre very lively as i think people can tell and you know theyre very confident girls and regardless of the fact that in this country certainly in the arts we treat comedy as a secondclass citizen ive never thought of it that way ive always thought it to be important the last time i looked the greeks were holding up two masks ive always thought of it not only as having equal value but as the craft of it being funny its funny but we were living on this small island off the coast of charleston south carolina when i was 9 i have no agenda except to be funny neither i or the writers profess to offer any worldly wisdom in my experience its not just that serious books get a hearing on comedy shows but serious books get a serious hearing as well as a funny one on comedy shows its a bit like school camp shooting a film everyones on heat its a strange energy its full of adrenalin i funnel my excess energy in funny little ways i do a lot of dancing in my trailer i love music heres the funny thing about the response ive been aware of to my dating famous people its been very negative im either not goodlooking enough not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people i like the hotcold the sugarsalt being able to play overthetop and dramatic things  in the same film just as in my life i can be very funny and at other times almost extinguished im an offroad racecar driver and i think every woman in my life has told me thats not a sensible hobby but when i was growing even more than i wanted to be funny i wanted to be a racecar driver thats all i thought about i worked for a race team when i was 15 and i traveled with them kyle bakers work is really funny but its also got a very clear vision its funny ive been very successful and done a lot of films and i dont really have an agent  i dont really pursue jobs i let people come to me if you look at the game and everything its not quite like looking at an animated film because thats total character this this is really movement but its got funny little things if you look for the humor theyre actually getting to the character its a funny thing because you look at the careers of other filmmakers and you see them sort of slow down and you realize maybe this becomes harder to do as you get older thats sort of a cautionary thing i hope it doesnt happen to me theres a darkness under the hangover because ultimately theres a missing person and its not really that funny theres a sort of darkness under it that i love and still people are laughing as hard if not harder than they did in old school i think people like comedies and i think concept driven comedies seem to be working when its a clear concept and you deliver funny stuff now that im more mature in a funny way i can even appreciate that ive bad to become more aware of my body since ive chosen acting as my career i have to keep my weight down anywayive been used to it for years so its no problem and theres nothing i cant do comedy is so subjective you could be in a room with 400 people laughing at a joke and you could just not think its funny youre just sitting there like am i in the twilight zone why is everyone laughing its such a personal thing people have such a personal visceral response to comedy i would do it today because the thing that appealed to me was not necessarily the mechanics of the robot but it was his personality and how funny and charming he was you know if i started worrying about what the critics think id never make another comedy you couldnt pick a less funny group than critics  you couldnt find a more bitter group of people when i was a kid i had this funny blonde hair and everyone called me chick because i looked like tweety bird i think that hangover ii is as funny as the hangover i honest to god but i think that its a little bit darker and the stakes are a little bit higher i dont think know if anythings going to translate anywhere youre making a movie you hope its going to be funny you cant think about how its going to go over if you can find the line between sympathetic and creepy you have reached a very funny area i dont think the public is dying to see me necessarily be funny all the time i love new york i was sad depressed and incredibly moved by our fellow countrymen and what theyve done i wanted to give people a chance to see something funny have a distraction jim carrey a comic genius has a harder time overcoming the publics desire for him to be funny simply because hes so good at it if you take a bunch of superstars and put them in a room where they dont have their assistants and entourage its funny to see what happens because death and illness are the most horrible things in life of course thats where the most absurdly funny things are going to happen i think one of the basic tasks in life  one of the nice things we can do for each other  is to take things that are horrible and scary and make them acceptable and less frightening and if possible funny it feels great to succeed at that i appreciate humor so much but im actually not a funny girl during the great depression when people laughed their worries disappeared audiences loved these funny men i decided to become one i remember interviewing someone i actually felt bad for and therefore didnt want to take an ironic stance against him it actually turned out to be a really funny piece i dont think my judgment is that good i dont know what is funny its funny the hardest thing to do is to make something look like its fast loose and improvised and get somebody to laugh sometimes we have to actually say i think youre really funny but none of your jokes are going to make it on the air so just answer my questions seriously im not a comedian im an actor who just happens to be funny on occasion the prospects for a coherent hilarious and consistent american comedy seem to lessen every year as the poor waterlogged gassy corpse called evan almighty proved when it floated ashore recently so theres a temptation to think too highly of robin williamss uneven but occasionally funny license to wed lucky is for laughs and theres really nothing funny that im doing on dexter i think more than anything both comment on the fact that anybody is capable of anything just because they are the shy guy in the corner doesnt mean that they are a harmless little bunny there have been times when i felt suicidal and i would stop my head from going in that direction of negativity because i thought thered be something id miss that was funny in the future if theres a chance im going to laugh tomorrow then want to live to experience that and remember its also very funny because side by side with grief lies joy i liked getting the best villain award i thought that was funny the music industry is really funny when you have a hit record everyone knows who are you everyone wants to do duets with you then if you have a miss people suffer from amnesia this is funny because i just had a job over the summer for vh1 a project i did called strange frequency where i got to play a goth rock band singer i mean im married first of all to one of if not the most wonderful women in the world she is everything  funny attractive hardworking she has integrity she loves me to bits a film that i love is raising arizona and thats funny but its quite indie and weird and odd and quirky id love to do something like that who knows and of course marc cherry heightens it and makes it hilarious but theres so many universal themes in the show and he made it so funny we knew he was onto something if he could keep it up and thankfully he did its so funny when youre actually directing because things start popping that you dont expect to pop and something that you think is going to pop maybe doesnt quite have the impetus that you thought it might well im not afraid to say something if i think its funny even if its harsh or racist the promos with all of the beautiful women probably attracted some men but the mystery story line is pretty cool its got that dark edge and people will watch anything funny but i think you can make fun of anything as long as its funny enough its funny because 1600 penn was the first time i really started to read the reviews because i am an executive producer and i wanted to see what people were enjoying and not enjoying as a means to an end right i mean i talk about being jewish a lot its funny because i do think of myself as jewish ethnically but im not religious at all i have no religion its funny because the book of mormon is the book of mormon now when i was doing it at the very beginning and i was a part of it for four years and always believed in it i never really knew if it was going to be more than a convention for south park fans i know people will think its funny because ive done glamour modelling in the past but i felt embarrassed about my body and just wanted to cover it up i got the wakeup call that no one is policing our oceans i wondered how can i do anything what really can i do to make things better there are some perks to being a celebrity my job is to be funny once in a while but its my responsibility to make good use of it my parents grandparents aunts and uncles were all funny and i felt that energy that delivery that timing that sarcasm all that stuff seeped into my brain wikipedia is just an incredible thing it is factencirclingly huge and it is idiosyncratic careful messy funny shocking and full of simmering controversies  and it is free and it is fast i dont write literary fiction  i write books that are entertaining but are also i hope wellconstructed and thoughtful and funny and have things to say about men and women and families and children and life in america today do you want me to apologize after every joke if it doesnt offend somebody its probably not a joke its probably an observation thats not funny its gotta offend somebody somewhere billy tauzin is one of the most interesting people in washington he is smart funny and interesting ive actually tried to roast somebody that i dont like and it doesnt go well either theyre a bad sport or im not as funny as i could be my parents are both very funny but theyre also relatively softspoken normal human beings while im just a lunatic i dont know where this loud ballsy hammy ridiculousness came from im just glad i followed my goals and my parents did too its not like we even had a plan when i dragged my mom to los angeles its funny though because when i first started going to races after we met i was extremely nervous its like being backstage and hoping you dont trip over something or break an amp or accidentally speak into a live microphone so i was really hesitant people are funny and in the most tragic situations when comedy erupts from nowhere it can turn on its head within the space of a second or a minute youre laughing one minute and youre crying the next and thats just life for me and that is what people are like so it was just funny to read a script that was just similar to what had been going on in my life when we criticize in iran the actions of the government the fundamentalists say that we and the bush administration are in the same camp the funny thing is that human rights activists and mr bush can never be situated in the same group i have a funny family but none of them are remotely in show business it is funny because the guy who is my boss now howard stern has a similarity there he got big being a regular guy he wasnt the greatest looking guy in the world but i think funny and talent will always win out i mean of course there are hurdles but i think if youre funny you will get over all of that the last person they expected to connect with a screenplay was the comedic blonde actress with the funny voice happiness often sneaks in through a door you didnt know you left open happiness is not something ready made it comes from your own actions most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be i am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation i may find myself for i have learned that the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony some cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go if you want others to be happy practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion a table a chair a bowl of fruit and a violin what else does a man need to be happy the purpose of our lives is to be happy our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits be happy with what you have and are be generous with both and you wont have to hunt for happiness dont wait around for other people to be happy for you any happiness you get youve got to make yourself true happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done the zest of creating things new the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life and that happiness not pain or mindless selfindulgence is the proof of your moral integrity since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values it is not how much we have but how much we enjoy that makes happiness happiness depends upon ourselves happiness doesnt depend on any external conditions it is governed by our mental attitude future that period of time in which our affairs prosper our friends are true and our happiness is assured we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts therefore guard accordingly and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing i know there is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will just do what must be done this may not be happiness but it is greatness there are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one  keep from telling their happiness to the unhappy the first recipe for happiness is avoid too lengthy meditation on the past happiness is not a goal it is a byproduct it is neither wealth nor splendor but tranquility and occupation which give you happiness money cant buy happiness but it can make you awfully comfortable while youre being miserable action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action true happiness is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose happiness is like a kiss you must share it to enjoy it if your happiness depends on what somebody else does i guess you do have a problem but what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads love is trembling happiness happiness is the only good the time to be happy is now the place to be happy is here the way to be happy is to make others so happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance order rhythm and harmony happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length if you want to be happy be be happy for this moment this moment is your life to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness in order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness  otherwise how would you know when youre happy your successes and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them true happiness is to enjoy the present without anxious dependence upon the future happy is the man who has broken the chains which hurt the mind and has given up worrying once and for all you can be happy where you are happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of ones values an effort made for the happiness of others lifts above ourselves everyone chases after happiness not noticing that happiness is right at their heels a sure way to lose happiness i found is to want it at the expense of everything else the two enemies of human happiness are pain and boredom happiness is found in doing not merely possessing the person born with a talent they are meant to use will find their greatest happiness in using it what we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of anything youre good at contributes to happiness there is only one happiness in this life to love and be loved happiness is an inside job every gift from a friend is a wish for your happiness all happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love happiness is a continuation of happenings which are not resisted happiness depends more on how life strikes you than on what happens there is something curiously boring about somebody elses happiness nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people in society it is a goal and an essential part of my life  a kind of destiny whoever is in distress can call on me i will come running wherever they are never mind your happiness do your duty you know its love when all you want is that person to be happy even if youre not part of their happiness happiness is ideal it is the work of the imagination do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself all who joy would win must share it happiness was born a twin you must try to generate happiness within yourself if you arent happy in one place chances are you wont be happy anyplace the greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness happiness an agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of another i am a kind of paranoid in reverse i suspect people of plotting to make me happy happiness is neither without us nor within us it is in god both without us and within us happiness exists on earth and it is won through prudent exercise of reason knowledge of the harmony of the universe and constant practice of generosity man needs for his happiness not only the enjoyment of this or that but hope and enterprise and change always leave something to wish for otherwise you will be miserable from your very happiness it is not gods will merely that we should be happy but that we should make ourselves happy when what we are is what we want to be thats happiness happiness is like those palaces in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons we must fight in order to conquer it happy he who learns to bear what he cannot change dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved happiness is having a scratch for every itch happiness grows at our own firesides and is not to be picked in strangers gardens the secret of happiness is to admire without desiring if you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured it may never arrive mountains will not be climbed races won or lasting happiness achieved happiness does not lie in happiness but in the achievement of it happiness comes only when we push our brains and hearts to the farthest reaches of which we are capable happiness is a direction not a place nothing prevents happiness like the memory of happiness the happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions true happiness consists not in the multitude of friends but in the worth and choice lovers who love truly do not write down their happiness its pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness poverty and wealth have both failed happiness is brief it will not stay god batters at its sails money cant buy you happiness but it can buy you a yacht big enough to pull up right alongside it happiness isnt something you experience its something you remember happiness is itself a kind of gratitude it is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be what he is it is not easy to find happiness in ourselves and it is not possible to find it elsewhere the moments of happiness we enjoy take us by surprise it is not that we seize them but that they seize us to describe happiness is to diminish it our happiness depends on wisdom all the way happiness includes chiefly the idea of satisfaction after full honest effort no one can possibly be satisfied and no one can be happy who feels that in some paramount affairs he failed to take up the challenge of life if you hope for happiness in the world hope for it from god and not from the world desire is individual happiness is common one of the keys to happiness is a bad memory happiness never lays its finger on its pulse happiness is the interval between periods of unhappiness happiness is like a cloud if you stare at it long enough it evaporates people let their own hangups become the obstacles between them and personal happiness unquestionably it is possible to do without happiness it is done involuntarily by nineteentwentieths of mankind happiness is a virtue not its reward happiness is mostly a byproduct of doing what makes us feel fulfilled happiness seems made to be shared there is only one passion the passion for happiness the happiness of most people is not ruined by great catastrophes or fatal errors but by the repetition of slowly destructive little things happiness is a byproduct you cannot pursue it by itself happiness is the harvest of a quiet eye happiness does not consist in selflove growth itself contains the germ of happiness to buy happiness is to sell soul only man clogs his happiness with care destroying what is with thoughts of what may be happiness is composed of misfortunes avoided love is the most terrible and also the most generous of the passions it is the only one which includes in its dreams the happiness of someone else satisfaction of ones curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life life in common among people who love each other is the ideal of happiness we possess only the happiness we are able to understand how easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success if you have easy selfcontentment you might have a very very cheap source of happiness to attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something while to secure it in this world we must do something we are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier the right to happiness is fundamental life everlasting in a state of happiness is the greatest desire of all men the happiness which is lacking makes one think even the happiness one has unbearable there is happiness in duty although it may not seem so the secret of happiness is to admire without desiring and that is not happiness happiness will come from materialism not from meaning so long as we can lose any happiness we possess some happiness is hard to recall its just a glow the action is best that secures the greatest happiness for the greatest number there is no worse sorrow than remembering happiness in the day of sorrow affection is responsible for ninetenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives if we can but prevent the government from wasting the labours of the people under the pretence of taking care of them they must become happy happiness is not something you postpone for the future it is something you design for the present thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle and the life of the candle will not be shortened happiness never decreases by being shared you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life to enjoy good health to bring true happiness to ones family to bring peace to all one must first discipline and control ones own mind if a man can control his mind he can find the way to enlightenment and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him the u s constitution doesnt guarantee happiness only the pursuit of it you have to catch up with it yourself your success and happiness lies in you resolve to keep happy and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties happiness resides not in possessions and not in gold happiness dwells in the soul it is very important to generate a good attitude a good heart as much as possible from this happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come happiness cannot be traveled to owned earned worn or consumed happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love grace and gratitude god cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from himself because it is not there there is no such thing friends show their love in times of trouble not in happiness love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own jealousy is a disease love is a healthy condition the immature mind often mistakes one for the other or assumes that the greater the love the greater the jealousy money has never made man happy nor will it there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness the more of it one has the more one wants today i choose life every morning when i wake up i can choose joy happiness negativity pain to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices  today i choose to feel life not to deny my humanity but embrace it the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness it is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only object of good government but o how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes i heard a definition once happiness is health and a short memory i wish id invented it because it is very true happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city the true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life happiness is not being pained in body or troubled in mind truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness success is getting what you want happiness is wanting what you get true happiness involves the full use of ones power and talents man falls from the pursuit of the ideal of plan living and high thinking the moment he wants to multiply his daily wants mans happiness really lies in contentment no one has a right to consume happiness without producing it love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own no matter how dull or how mean or how wise a man is he feels that happiness is his indisputable right never make friends with people who are above or below you in status such friendships will never give you any happiness since you get more joy out of giving joy to others you should put a good deal of thought into the happiness that you are able to give god will prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven and if it takes my dog being there i believe hell be there marriage is the most natural state of man and the state in which you will find solid happiness it is a curious sensation the sort of pain that goes mercifully beyond our powers of feeling when your heart is broken your boats are burned nothing matters any more it is the end of happiness and the beginning of peace choose your lifes mate carefully from this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery are you bored with life then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart live for it die for it and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours they must often change who would be constant in happiness or wisdom we find delight in the beauty and happiness of children that makes the heart too big for the body three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for politicians also have no leisure because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself power and glory or happiness different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government dont wish me happiness  i dont expect to be happy its gotten beyond that somehow wish me courage and strength and a sense of humor  i will need them all a mothers happiness is like a beacon lighting up the future but reflected also on the past in the guise of fond memories there is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself the man who makes everything that leads to happiness depends upon himself and not upon other men has adopted the very best plan for living happily this is the man of moderation the man of manly character and of wisdom the only thing that could spoil a day was people people were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself money wont buy happiness but it will pay the salaries of a large research staff to study the problem to find out what one is fitted to do and to secure an opportunity to do it is the key to happiness success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful happiness is neither virtue nor pleasure nor this thing nor that but simply growth we are happy when we are growing the smallest seed of faith is better than the largest fruit of happiness happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best i would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder independence is happiness happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort we have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it never permit a dichotomy to rule your life a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time i start to think there really is no cure for depression that happiness is an ongoing battle and i wonder if it isnt one ill have to fight for as long as i live i wonder if its worth it happiness can exist only in acceptance people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost remember happiness doesnt depend upon who you are or what you have it depends solely on what you think there is no austerity equal to a balanced mind and there is no happiness equal to contentment there is no disease like covetousness and no virtue like mercy there is nothing i fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources those who are poor illiterate and ridden with terminal disease the happiness of this life depends less on what befalls you than the way in which you take it a man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside thinking that his happiness lies outside him finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him the world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity and a lot of judgment i just think people need to start shifting into joy and happiness as corny as it sounds we need to make a shift there is joy in work there is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something be more dedicated to making solid achievements than in running after swift but synthetic happiness life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles but in avoiding them a masterly retreat is in itself a victory the word happiness would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness no one is in control of your happiness but you therefore you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change our object in the construction of the state is the greatest happiness of the whole and not that of any one class success is getting what you want happiness is liking what you get success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best of course to have money is just great because you can do what you think is important to you i always was a rich person because moneys not related to happiness happiness is a butterfly which when pursued is always just beyond your grasp but which if you will sit down quietly may alight upon you wealth like happiness is never attained when sought after directly it comes as a byproduct of providing a useful service we all want to help one another human beings are like that we want to live by each others happiness not by each others misery love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness the happiness of society is the end of government the happiness and peace attained by those satisfied by the nectar of spiritual tranquillity is not attained by greedy persons restlessly moving here and there happiness is a ball after which we run wherever it rolls and we push it with our feet when it stops a really great talent finds its happiness in execution all you need for happiness is a good gun a good horse and a good wife it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe the person who seeks all their applause from outside has their happiness in anothers keeping  the secret of happiness is this let your interests be as wide as possible and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile the greatest happiness is to know the source of unhappiness the secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible the art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things action may not bring happiness but there is no happiness without action the supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather in spite of ourselves god isnt compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness you must make your choice our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness the only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open there is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery the essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things happiness is beneficial for the body but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind money is human happiness in the abstract he then who is no longer capable of enjoying human happiness in the concrete devotes himself utterly to money one of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between man and nature shall not be broken for the poison of hatred seated near the heart doubles the burden for the one who suffers the disease he is burdened with his own sorrow and groans on seeing anothers happiness happiness a good cigar a good meal a good cigar and a good woman  or a bad woman it depends on how much happiness you can handle ive made an odd discovery every time i talk to a savant i feel quite sure that happiness is no longer a possibility yet when i talk with my gardener im convinced of the opposite contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other peoples happiness and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race it is not in the pursuit of happiness that we find fulfillment it is in the happiness of pursuit a wise woman recognizes when her life is out of balance and summons the courage to act to correct it she knows the meaning of true generosity happiness is the reward for a life lived in harmony with a courage and grace what we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the preferably sudden satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree if there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others we could have a paradise in a few years live by this credo have a little laugh at life and look around you for happiness instead of sadness laughter has always brought me out of unhappy situations doing nothing is happiness for children and misery for old men a smile is happiness youll find right under your nose the first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion lifes greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved happiness is a hard master particularly other peoples happiness i do believe that if you havent learnt about sadness you cannot appreciate happiness where fear is happiness is not friendship improves happiness and abates misery by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief to be perfectly happy it does not suffice to possess happiness it is necessary to have deserved it how to gain how to keep how to recover happiness is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all they do and of all they are willing to endure procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy if all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness one test of the correctness of educational procedure is the happiness of the child men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone of all forms of caution caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness wisdom allows nothing to be good that will not be so forever no man to be happy but he that needs no other happiness than what he has within himself no man to be great or powerful that is not master of himself now and then its good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy happiness is the reward we get for living to the highest right we know my happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance and in inverse proportion to my expectations beauty is the promise of happiness happiness is not a reward  it is a consequence suffering is not a punishment  it is a result when ambition ends happiness begins if virtue promises happiness prosperity and peace then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us progress is always an approach toward it fun i love but too much fun is of all things the most loathsome mirth is better than fun and happiness is better than mirth did perpetual happiness in the garden of eden maybe get so boring that eating the apple was justified a man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy healthy and prosperous being and happiness health and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer of the man with his surroundings he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition will waste his life in fruitless efforts imagination disposes of everything it creates beauty justice and happiness which are everything in this world happiness is a byproduct of function purpose and conflict those who seek happiness for itself seek victory without war resolve not to be poor whatever you have spend less poverty is a great enemy to human happiness it certainly destroys liberty and it makes some virtues impracticable and others extremely difficult happiness is a how not a what a talent not an object happiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination bride a woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her happiness in this world when it comes comes incidentally make it the object of pursuit and it leads us a wildgoose chase and is never attained follow some other object and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it happiness is not a brilliant climax to years of grim struggle and anxiety it is a long succession of little decisions simply to be happy in the moment it were a real increase of human happiness could all young men from the age of nineteen be covered under barrels or rendered otherwise invisible and there left to follow their lawful studies and callings till they emerged sadder and wiser at the age of twentyfive when youre passionate about something you want it to be all it can be but in the endgame of life i fundamentally believe the key to happiness is letting go of that idea of perfection the consuming desire of most human beings is deliberately to plant their whole life in the hands of some other person i would describe this method of searching for happiness as immature development of character consists solely in moving toward selfsufficiency the only happiness a brave person ever troubles themselves in asking about is happiness enough to get their work done were taught to be ashamed of confusion anger fear and sadness and to me theyre of equal value to happiness excitement and inspiration a string of excited fugitive miscellaneous pleasures is not happiness happiness resides in imaginative reflection and judgment when the picture of ones life or of human life as it truly has been or is satisfies the will and is gladly accepted indeed man wishes to be happy even when he so lives as to make happiness impossible in friendship as well as love ignorance very often contributes more to our happiness than knowledge the white mans happiness cannot be purchased by the black mans misery while it is important for people to see your promise you must also remember that hope is the keeper of both happiness and disappointment the father of both progress and failure happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised happiness is the absence of the striving for happiness even in the common affairs of life in love friendship and marriage how little security have we when we trust our happiness in the hands of others the happiness and misery of men depend no less on temper than fortune man is fond of counting his troubles but he does not count his joys if he counted them up as he ought to he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it the health of the people is really the foundation upon which all their happiness and all their powers as a state depend no man chooses evil because it is evil he only mistakes it for happiness the good he seeks happiness is your own treasure because it lies within you my creed is that happiness is the only good the place to be happy is here the time to be happy is now the way to be happy is to make others so ive learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances to be stupid selfish and have good health are three requirements for happiness though if stupidity is lacking all is lost life does not agree with philosophy there is no happiness that is not idleness and only what is useless is pleasurable true happiness arises in the first place from the enjoyment of ones self and in the next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions nothing flatters a man as much as the happiness of his wife he is always proud of himself as the source of it why love if losing hurts so much i have no answers anymore only the life i have lived the pain now is part of the happiness then ladies of fashion starve their happiness to feed their vanity and their love to feed their pride the secret to happiness is freedom and the secret to freedom is courage the intense happiness of our union is derived in a high degree from the perfect freedom with which we each follow and declare our own impressions people say that money is not the key to happiness but i always figured if you have enough money you can have a key made we must have courage to bet on our ideas to take the calculated risk and to act everyday living requires courage if life is to be effective and bring happiness when youre happy you find pure joy in your life there are no regrets in this state of happiness  and thats a goal worth striving for in all areas of your life it is not true that suffering ennobles the character happiness does that sometimes but suffering for the most part makes men petty and vindictive whether happiness may come or not one should try and prepare ones self to do without it a womans heart must be of such a size and no larger else it must be pressed small like chinese feet her happiness is to be made as cakes are by a fixed recipe every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time and may therefore be demanded back the next hour for happiness one needs security but joy can spring like a flower even from the cliffs of despair happiness is the natural flower of duty no man is happy without a delusion of some kind delusions are as necessary to our happiness as realities the happiness of life is made up of minute fractions  the little soon forgotten charities of a kiss or a smile a kind look or heartfelt compliment we exaggerate misfortune and happiness alike we are never as bad off or as happy as we say we are mans only true happiness is to live in hope of something to be won by him reverence something to be worshipped by him and love something to be cherished by him forever happiness lies neither in vice nor in virtue but in the manner we appreciate the one and the other and the choice we make pursuant to our individual organization happiness is good health and a bad memory happiness is different from pleasure happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing the man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent and he is never bored and life is only too short and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness it is pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness poverty and wealth have both failed i have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires rather than in attempting to satisfy them work and live to serve others to leave the world a little better than you found it and garner for yourself as much peace of mind as you can this is happiness i am about to be married and am of course in all the misery of a man in pursuit of happiness there is a difference between happiness and wisdom he that thinks himself the happiest man is really so but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool subordination tends greatly to human happiness were we all upon an equality we should have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleasure happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance money cant buy you happiness but it does bring you a more pleasant form of misery i thank my god for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness whoever said money cant buy happiness simply didnt know where to go shopping our envy always lasts longer than the happiness of those we envy i have this really high priority on happiness and finding something to be happy about selfpity comes so naturally to all of us the most solid happiness can be shaken by the compassion of a fool the happiness of the bee and the dolphin is to exist for man it is to know that and to wonder at it beauty for some provides escape who gain a happiness in eyeing the gorgeous buttocks of the ape or autumn sunsets exquisitely dying while we are focusing on fear worry or hate it is not possible for us to be experiencing happiness enthusiasm or love the most worthwhile thing is to try to put happiness into the lives of others little islands of human happiness peace and prosperity are so exceptional at this point in history that im not even sure we can draw lessons from them the happiness of ones own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul one must try to include as necessary to ones own happiness the happiness of others caring about others running the risk of feeling and leaving an impact on people brings happiness wisdom is the supreme part of happiness plenty of people miss their share of happiness not because they never found it but because they didnt stop to enjoy it the great thing in the world is not so much to seek happiness as to earn peace and selfrespect curiosity is one of the great secrets of happiness there is no end of craving hence contentment alone is the best way to happiness therefore acquire contentment i refuse to accept other peoples ideas of happiness for me as if theres a one size fits all standard for happiness i would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government other than another it is of no moment to the happiness of an individual we are long before we are convinced that happiness is never to be found and each believes it possessed by others to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern there is nothing sir too little for so little a creature as man it is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible there is no private house in which people can enjoy themselves so well as at a capital tavern no sir there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn happiness is a choice that requires effort at times happiness is the only sanction of life where happiness fails existence remains a mad and lamentable experiment you traverse the world in search of happiness which is within the reach of every man a contented mind confers it on all there is no true love save in suffering and in this world we have to choose either love which is suffering or happiness man is the more man  that is the more divine  the greater his capacity for suffering or rather for anguish i can say that i never knew what joy was like until i gave up pursuing happiness or cared to live until i chose to die for these two discoveries i am beholden to jesus happiness serves hardly any other purpose than to make unhappiness possible music should probably provide answers in terms of lyrical content and giving people a sense of togetherness and oneness as opposed to being alone in their thoughts and dilemmas or regrets or happiness or whatever our principles are the springs of our actions our actions the springs of our happiness or misery too much care therefore cannot be taken in forming our principles to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea there is this difference between happiness and wisdom he that thinks himself the happiest man really is so but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool the founders of a new colony whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion as the site of a prison money may not buy happiness but it can damn well give it i hump the wild to take it all in there is no bag limit on happiness every day is a new day and youll never be able to find happiness if you dont move on suspicion is not less an enemy to virtue than to happiness he that is already corrupt is naturally suspicious and he that becomes suspicious will quickly be corrupt the world is full of people looking for spectacular happiness while they snub contentment a sincere and steadfast cooperation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the united states when we recall the past we usually find that it is the simplest things  not the great occasions  that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness dancing and running shake up the chemistry of happiness know then this truth enough for man to know virtue alone is happiness below my imagination can picture no fairer happiness than to continue living for art i have discovered the secret of happiness  it is work either with the hands or the head the moment i have something to do the draughts are open and my chimney draws and i am happy power after love is the first source of happiness selfesteem is as important to our wellbeing as legs are to a table it is essential for physical and mental health and for happiness happiness is inward and not outward and so it does not depend on what we have but on what we are my whole working philosophy is that the only stable happiness for mankind is that it shall live married in blessed union to womankind  intimacy physical and psychical between a man and his wife i wish to add that my state of bliss is by no means perfect the secret of happiness is something to do we never taste happiness in perfection our most fortunate successes are mixed with sadness if you ever find happiness by hunting for it you will find it as the old woman did her lost spectacles safe on her own nose all the time i take it that the good of mankind means the attainment by every man of all the happiness which he can enjoy without diminishing the happiness of his fellow men people are surprised at how downtoearth i am i like to stay home on friday nights and listen to the art of happiness by the dalai lama happiness is within it has nothing to do with how much applause you get or how many people praise you happiness comes when you believe that you have done something truly meaningful happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it is love is not a feeling of happiness love is a willingness to sacrifice character is the basis of happiness and happiness the sanction of character knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of happiness we believe as our founders did that the pursuit of happiness depends upon individual liberty and individual liberty requires limited government ones work usually occupies more than half of ones waking life choosing work that does not bring happiness will lead to a life that is mostly disappointing i understand by this passion the union of desire friendship and tenderness which is inflamed by a single female which prefers her to the rest of her sex and which seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our being what would there be in a story of happiness only what prepares it only what destroys it can be told a wise woman never yields by appointment it should always be an unforeseen happiness completeness happiness these words dont come close to describing my emotions there truly is nothing i can say to capture what motherhood means to me particularly given my medical history when a man has lost all happiness hes not alive call him a breathing corpse happiness is secured through virtue it is a good attained by mans own will you take away all the other luxuries in life and if you can make someone smile and laugh you have given the most special gift happiness happiness a good bank account a good cook and a good digestion happiness is your dentist telling you it wont hurt and then having him catch his hand in the drill false happiness renders men stern and proud and that happiness is never communicated true happiness renders them kind and sensible and that happiness is always shared happiness isnt getting what you want its wanting what you got whats the use of happiness it cant buy you money although the skills arent hard to learn finding the happiness and finding the satisfaction and finding fulfillment in continuously serving somebody else something good to eat is what makes a really good restaurant genuine happiness can only be achieved when we transform our way of life from the unthinking pursuit of pleasure to one committed to enriching our inner lives when we focus on being more rather than simply having more my whole thing is to agree to disagree and to have respect because nothing can really be changed and you wouldnt want to ruin their happiness  even if that happiness is ignorance the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not our circumstances the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness you know the passage where scarlett voices her happiness that her mother is dead so that she cant see what a bad girl scarlett has become well thats me a good way i know to find happiness is to not bore a hole to fit the plug and one who is just of his own free will shall not lack for happiness and he will never come to utter ruin to desire and strive to be of some service to the world to aim at doing something which shall really increase the happiness and welfare and virtue of mankind  this is a choice which is possible for all of us and surely it is a good haven to sail for to be obliged to beg our daily happiness from others bespeaks a more lamentable poverty than that of him who begs his daily bread im fulfilled in what i do i never thought that a lot of money or fine clothes  the finer things of life  would make you happy my concept of happiness is to be filled in a spiritual sense one of the indictments of civilizations is that happiness and intelligence are so rarely found in the same person grief at the absence of a loved one is happiness compared to life with a person one hates if you have not taken the time to define what happiness means to you what have your spent your whole life pursuing there is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball and that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all i want anyone who believes in life liberty pursuit of happiness to succeed and i want any force any person any element of an overarching big government that would stop your success i want that organization that element or that person to fail i want you to succeed existence is a strange bargain life owes us little we owe it everything the only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose so long as you dont feel lifes paltry and a miserable business the rest doesnt matter happiness or unhappiness i might have some character traits that some might see as innocence or naive thats because i discovered peace and happiness in my soul and with this knowledge i also see the beauty of human life unhappiness is something we are never taught about we are taught to expect happiness but never a plan b to use to use when the happiness doesnt arrive happiness that grand mistress of the ceremonies in the dance of life impels us through all its mazes and meanderings but leads none of us by the same route always remember that the most important thing in a good marriage is not happiness but stability happiness is mental harmony unhappiness is mental inharmony happiness is a thing to be practiced like the violin i know not why there is such a melancholy feeling attached to the remembrance of past happiness except that we fear that the future can have nothing so bright as the past music is the refuge of souls ulcerated by happiness when i was waiting tables washing dishes or mowing lawns for money i never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life i was on my own path my own journey an american journey where i could think for myself decide for myself define happiness for myself romance and novel paint beauty in colors more charming than nature and describe a happiness that humans never taste how deceptive and destructive are those pictures of consummate bliss happiness is obsolete uneconomic a pencil and rubber are of more use to thought than a battalion of assistants to happiness the same applies as to truth one does not have it but is in it happiness is an attitude of mind born of the simple determination to be happy under all outward circumstances grief knits two hearts in closer bonds than happiness ever can and common sufferings are far stronger links than common joys now i believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid entwined together on a bed of clover and left there to sleep left there to dream of their happiness some of us might find happiness if we quit struggling so desperately for it actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness by happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain i wish people could acheive what they think would bring them happiness in order for them to realize that thats not really what happiness is such happiness as life is capable of comes from the full participation of all our powers in the endeavor to wrest from each changing situations of experience its own full and unique meaning the secret to true happiness is a combination of low expectations and insensitivity i saw that all beings are fated to happiness action is not life but a way of wasting some force an enervation morality is the weakness of the brain crying is cleansing theres a reason for tears happiness or sadness success is getting and achieving what you want happiness is wanting and being content with what you get just stop for a minute and youll realize youre happy just being i think its the pursuit that screws up happiness if we drop the pursuit its right here one mustnt ask apple trees for oranges france for sun women for love life for happiness oh if i had been loved at the age of seventeen what an idiot i would be today happiness is like smallpox if you catch it too soon it can completely ruin your constitution we are built to conquer environment solve problems achieve goals and we find no real satisfaction or happiness in life without obstacles to conquer and goals to achieve thus happiness depends as nature shows less on exterior things than most suppose alas if the principles of contentment are not within us the height of station and worldly grandeur will as soon add a cubit to a mans stature as to his happiness happiness and virtue rest upon each other the best are not only the happiest but the happiest are usually the best tell him on the contrary that he needs in the interest of his own happiness to walk in the path of humility and selfcontrol and he will be indifferent or even actively resentful an act of goodness is of itself an act of happiness no reward coming after the event can compare with the sweet reward that went with it people truly reaching across boundaries  be they religious or race political or geographic a state that is sincerely civil and respectful of each individuals pathway toward life liberty and the pursuit of happiness will be our goal gods children and their happiness are my reasons for being happiness in the present is only shattered by comparison with the past happiness is a sunbeam which may pass through a thousand bosoms without losing a particle of its original ray nay when it strikes on a kindred heart like the converged light on a mirror it reflects itself with redoubled brightness it is not perfected till it is shared in theory there is a possibility of perfect happiness to believe in the indestructible element within one and not to strive towards it i really love being alive i love my family and my work i love the opportunity i have to do things thats what happiness is happiness is a monstrosity punished are those who seek it happiness is a very small desk and a very big wastebasket everyone has their own way of expressing happiness my faith helps me understand that circumstances dont dictate my happiness my inner peace if thou be industrious to procure wealth be generous in the disposal of it man never is so happy as when he giveth happiness unto another what ever our wandering our happiness will always be found within a narrow compass and in the middle of the objects more immediately within our reach there is no cosmetic for beauty like happiness today we stand as a united country and are much closer to the ideals set forth in our constitution that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness offspring the due performance on religious rites faithful service highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself depend on ones wife alone objects we ardently pursue bring little happiness when gained most of our pleasures come from unexpected sources for this generation ours life is nuclear survival liberty is human rights the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants happiness is dependent on selfdiscipline we are the biggest obstacles to our own happiness it is much easier to do battle with society and with others than to fight our own nature the will of man is his happiness the constitution guarantees us our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness thats all it doesnt guarantee our rights to charity life is to be fortified by many friendships to love and to be loved is the greatest happiness of existence everyone needs a certain amount of money beyond that we pursue money because we know how to obtain it we dont necessarily know how to obtain happiness ive never felt like i was in the cookie business ive always been in a feel good feeling business my job is to sell joy my job is to sell happiness my job is to sell an experience this happiness consisted of nothing else but the harmony of the few things around me with my own existence a feeling of contentment and wellbeing that needed no changes and no intensification the happiness of the creature consists in rejoicing in god by which also god is magnified and exalted the said truth is that it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong happiness contentment the health and growth of the soul depend as men have proved over and over again upon some simple issue some single turning of the soul derive happiness in oneself from a good days work from illuminating the fog that surrounds us there are as many kinds of beauty as there are habitual ways of seeking happiness happiness consists in giving and in serving others off with you youre a happy fellow for youll give happiness and joy to many other people there is nothing better or greater than that there can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do you get to a certain age where you prepare yourself for happiness sometimes you never remember to actually get happy sorrow happens hardship happens the hell with it who never knew the price of happiness will not be happy happiness is working with jack lemmon happiness is spiritual born of truth and love it is unselfish therefore it cannot exist alone but requires all mankind to share it when you relinquish the desire to control your future you can have more happiness happiness is understanding that friendship is more precious than mere things more precious than getting your own way more precious than being in situations where true principles are not at stake it is one of my sources of happiness never to desire a knowledge of other peoples business the british do not expect happiness i had the impression all the time that i lived there that they do not want to be happy they want to be right values are principles and ideas that bring meaning to the seemingly mundane experience of life a meaningful life that ultimately brings happiness and pride requires you to respond to temptations as well as challenges with honor dignity and courage from their teenage years on children are considerably more capable of causing parents unhappiness than bringing them happiness that is one reason parents who rely on their children for happiness make both their children and themselves miserable but happiness is no respecter of persons he who avoids complaint invites happiness happiness and peace will come to earth only as the light of love and human compassion enter the souls of men the ultimate end of human acts is eudaimonia happiness in the sense of living well which all men desire all acts are but different means chosen to arrive at it i always seem to have a vague feeling that he is a satan among musicians a fallen angel in the darkness who is perpetually seeking to fight his way back to happiness but what is after all the happiness of mere power there is a greater happiness possible than to be lord of heaven and earth that is the happiness of being truly loved since every man desires happiness it is evidently no small matter whether he conceives of happiness in terms of work or of enjoyment the office of government is not to confer happiness but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves what can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health out of debt and has a clear conscience ultimately all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness why then have we ended up producing the opposite result could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness i can be forced to live without happiness but i will never consent to live without honor money if it does not bring you happiness will at least help you be miserable in comfort its enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back there is no happiness in having or in getting but only in giving happiness is no respecter of persons to be able to throw ones self away for the sake of a moment to be able to sacrifice years for a womans smile  that is happiness i dont know the true meaning of happiness those who won our independence valued liberty as an end and as a means they believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty maturity  among other things the unclouded happiness of the child at play who takes it for granted that he is at one with his playmates no one is guaranteed happiness you can pursue it but if you happen to find success along the way on that road to happiness conservatives believe you should not be demonized or penalized for it happiness comes when we test our skills towards some meaningful purpose when a small child i thought that success spelled happiness i was wrong happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment but soon flits away happiness isnt happiness unless theres a violinplaying goat i certainly wasnt happy happiness has to do with reason and only reason earns it what i was given was the thing you cant earn and cant keep and often dont even recognize at the time i mean joy happiness is perfume you cant pour it on somebody else without getting a few drops on yourself i have often met with happiness after some imprudent step which ought to have brought ruin upon me and although passing a vote of censure upon myself i would thank god for his mercy try to make at least one person happy every day if you cannot do a kind deed speak a kind word if you cannot speak a kind word think a kind thought count up if you can the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week in a year in a lifetime i dont understand why europeans and south americans can take more sophistication why is it that americans need to hear their happiness major and their tragedy minor and as jazzy as they can handle is a seventh chord are they not experiencing complex emotions the art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change happiness like a child must be allowed to grow up the ultimate end of education is happiness or a good human life a life enriched by the possession of every kind of good by the enjoyment of every type of satisfaction there is no fulfillment in things whatsoever and i think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness but what in fact does is having a cause having a passion and thats really what gives lifes true meaning weve got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because thats easier its much more difficult to make a film about happiness with lots of jokes in it the most exciting happiness is the happiness generated by forces beyond your control happiness is the longing for repetition the bluebird of happiness long absent from his life ned is visited by the chicken of depression it takes great wit and interest and energy to be happy the pursuit of happiness is a great activity one must be open and alive it is the greatest feat man has to accomplish if you are kept in ignorance of the true way and permit yourself to rely upon and be guided by the opinion of imperfect man you can never gain the riches that will bring you peace and lasting happiness fate often puts all the material for happiness and prosperity into a mans hands just to see how miserable he can make himself with them holiness not happiness is the chief end of man happiness is nothing but temporary moments here and there  and i love those but i would be bored out of my mind if i were happy all the time ive run into certain geniuses of individualism  they are very few and far between  who live their lives completely on their own terms they are very powerful and have a great amount of happiness we all should aspire to that as to happiness in this life it is hardly compatible with that diminished respect which ever attends the relinquishing of labour no human being can really understand another and no one can arrange anothers happiness there is no correlation between happiness and amounts of money even when they have nothing the irish emit a kind of happiness a joy and of all illumination which human reason can give none is comparable to the discovery of what we are our nature our obligations what happiness we are capable of and what are the means of attaining it as a child is indulged or checked in its early follies a ground is generally laid for the happiness or misery of the future man well there are two kinds of happiness grounded and ungrounded ungrounded happiness is cheesy and not based on reality grounded happiness is informed happiness based on the knowledge that the world sometimes sucks but even then you have to believe in yourself to play someone who is who they are because of the happiness and contentedness that theyve known in their life is interesting because of sort of how banal it is it is now possible to quantify peoples levels of happiness pretty accurately by asking them by observation and by measuring electrical activity in the brain in degrees from terrible pain to sublime joy oh i adored mickey mouse when i was a child he was the emblem of happiness and funniness you went to the movies then you saw two movies and a short when mickey mouse came on the screen and there was his big head my sister said she had to hold onto me i went berserk i adored mickey mouse when i was a child he was the emblem of happiness and funniness happiness is a matter of ones most ordinary and everyday mode of consciousness being busy and lively and unconcerned with self it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him its horrible when people are only interested in buying labels because it doesnt bring them the happiness they think it will an institution or reform movement that is not selfish must originate in the recognition of some evil that is adding to the sum of human suffering or diminishing the sum of happiness i learned from a very young age that if i pursued the things that truly excited me that they would reward in more important ways like happiness i enjoy being happy every day and hopefully you can hear my happiness in my music life is beautiful all people desire what they believe will make them happy if a person is not full of desire for god we can only conclude that he is engaged with another happiness one must never look for happiness one meets it by the way most people ask for happiness on condition happiness can only be felt if you dont set any condition true religion is giving and finding ones happiness by bringing happiness into the lives of others there is no happiness in love except at the end of an english novel when god loves a creature he wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery he wants him to know all that being alive can bring that is his best gift there is no happiness save in understanding the whole happiness is a wine of the rarest vintage and seems insipid to a vulgar taste i have my moments ever since i was a boy i never was someone who was at ease with happiness too often i embrace introspection and selfdoubt i wish i could embrace the good things people will survive and they will find happiness happiness only comes when youre not looking for it every poll about the left the right and happiness reveals that the farther left one goes the less happy the person is likely to be happiness held is the seed happiness shared is the flower a good cook is like a sorceress who dispenses happiness i am happy as happiness goes for a woman who has so many memories and who lives the lonely life of an actress lucky that man whose children make his happiness in life and not his grief the anguished disappointment of his hopes there is a set of religious or rather moral writings which teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness and vice to misery in this world a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine and to which we have but one objection namely that it is not true america has believed that in differentiation not in uniformity lies the path of progress it acted on this belief it has advanced human happiness and it has prospered remember the rights of the savage as we call him remember that the happiness of his humble home remember that the sanctity of life in the hill villages of afghanistan among the winter snows is as inviolable in the eye of almighty god as can be your own there is no happiness for people at the expense of other people it is the personality of the mistress that the home expresses men are forever guests in our homes no matter how much happiness they may find there i try to stress to my children that buying something never leads to true happiness getting married for me was the best thing i ever did i was suddenly beset with an immense sense of release that we have something more important than our separate selves and that is the marriage theres immense happiness that can come from working towards that the pursuit of happiness which american citizens are obliged to undertake tends to involve them in trying to perpetuate the moods tastes and aptitudes of youth why does watching a dog be a dog fill one with happiness happiness is always a coincidence i will always stay close to all compatriots and share together the happiness and suffering all happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast my idea of perfect happiness is a healthy family peace between nations and all the critics die the gratification of desire is not happiness happiness is a choice you can choose to be happy theres going to be stress in life but its your choice whether you let it affect you or not joy rather than happiness is the goal of life for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings it is based on the experience of ones identity as a being of worth and dignity that is happiness to be dissolved into something complete and great youve got to ask asking is in my opinion the worlds most powerful  and neglected  secret to success and happiness i never was someone who was at ease with happiness it was as if all of the happiness all of the magic of this blissful hour had flowed together into these stirring bittersweet tones and flowed away becoming temporal and transitory once more you believe happiness to be derived from the place in which once you have been happy but in truth it is centered in ourselves we all have a hungry heart and one of the things we hunger for is happiness so as much as i possibly could i stayed where i was happy i spent a great deal of time in my younger years just writing and reading walking around the woods in ohio where i grew up my life has run from misery to happiness happiness no its not there for me friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another life finds its purpose and fulfillment in the expansion of happiness those who seek happiness miss it and those who discuss it lack it try to put your happiness before anyone elses because you may never have done so in your entire life if you really think about it if you are really honest with yourself a comfortable house is a great source of happiness it ranks immediately after health and a good conscience the purpose of human life and the sense of happiness is to give the maximum what the man is able to give the sound of laughter is like the vaulted dome of a temple of happiness happiness is an imaginary condition formerly attributed by the living to the dead now usually attributed by adults to children and by children to adults the dalai lama he is a very wise man of great inner peace who believes that happiness is the purpose of our lives through his teachings and leadership he continues to make this world a better place in which to live its afterwards you realize that the feeling of happiness you had with a man didnt necessarily prove that you loved him when we were together i loved you deeply and you gave me so much happiness i can never repay you you know i think we indians are afraid to show and celebrate our happiness lest things change around but i feel that its okay to be sad and okay to show when you are happy ive gotten to a point where i realize that happiness doesnt come from the outside it is work work that one delights in that is the surest guarantor of happiness but even here it is a work that has to be earned by labor in ones earlier years one should labor so hard in youth that everything one does subsequently is easy by comparison what if i couldnt handle peoples opinions of me i know that shouldnt dictate a persons degree of peace or happiness in life but the problem is i chose a business saturated in judgment so my happiness doesnt come from money or fame my happiness comes from seeing life without struggle happiness is not a state to arrive at but a manner of traveling there is an old saying that money cant buy happiness if it could i would buy myself four hits every game remember that happiness is as contagious as gloom it should be the first duty of those who are happy to let others know of their gladness i admit i cant shake the idea that there is virtue in suffering that there is a sort of psychic economy whereby if you embrace success happiness and comfort these things have to be paid for happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply to enjoy simply to think freely to risk life to be needed i see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire in fact i consider it integral to our success mechanism becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble if you must have it in order to be happy then you are denying the happiness of the here and now to show a child what once delighted you to find the childs delight added to your own  this is happiness i believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves  that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation i dont think that sin and pursuing happiness are not necessarily the same thing how can you tell somebody whose is pursuing happiness that theyre somehow not american when that was the very first promise that america made the pursuit of happiness is a most ridiculous phrase if you pursue happiness youll never find it here is my prescription to heal all wounds watch the film funny girl at least five times eat at least 45 chocolate bars and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex i truly believe that through a combination of nutella old pals and barbra streisand we can achieve happiness and very probably world peace it is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first the very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose aiming at something outside self liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body without health no pleasure can be tasted by man without liberty no happiness can be enjoyed by society my parents theyve been my biggest influences and supporters since day one they teach me every day that happiness comes from within and not from something outside of your heart i think the key to happiness is allowing ourselves to not feel bad or guilty for feeling it and letting it be contagious and to not be dependent on other people to create your own happiness the discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star for me love is happiness and inspiration it is also rarer to find happiness in a man surrounded by the miracles of technology than among people living in the desert of the jungle and who by the standards set by our society would be considered destitute and out of touch people are chasing cash not happiness when you chase money youre going to lose youre just going to even if you get the money youre not going to be happy my mother is a big believer in being responsible for your own happiness she always talked about finding joy in small moments and insisted that we stop and take in the beauty of an ordinary day when i stop the car to make my kids really see a sunset i hear my mothers voice and smile i think happiness comes from selfacceptance we all try different things and we find some comfortable sense of who we are we look at our parents and learn and grow and move on we change there is no excellence without labor one cannot dream oneself into either usefulness or happiness and perfect happiness man thats a the pool is about 92 degrees the jacuzzi is about 102 and an avocado farm i guess happiness is not a state you want to be in all the time when youre in love youre so happy that you want to tell people about it but now i have to censor myself you need to protect the happiness you have ive worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and youre in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room youre taken care of and the food is amazing the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work worldly wealth is the devils bait and those whose minds feed upon riches recede in general from real happiness in proportion as their stores increase as the moon when she is fullest is farthest from the sun one thing ive been happy as peach pie about  because im all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home  is that nannies day cares and babysitters are all collapsing which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home i cant believe its been four years now and from watching that pilot we really all looked like babies its unbelievable just how far everything has come im happier now than ive ever been on the show and in my life i really owe so much of my happiness to glee the mindset of chasing that next 1 record doesnt exist for me anymore its more about being a wellrounded entertainer than being a pop artist obviously it would be wonderful to have a hit record but i dont base my happiness on that anymore its about the accomplishment of a project that satisfies me i just want to enjoy the ride the day when a sportsman stops thinking above all else of the happiness in his own effort and the intoxication of the power and physical balance he derives from it the day when he lets considerations of vanity or interest take over on this day his ideal will die there is something in the pang of change more than the heart can bear unhappiness remembering happiness pleasure only starts once the worm has got into the fruit to become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison i think the secret to happiness is having a teflon soul whatever comes your way you either let it slide or you cook with it i am more and more convinced that our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of life than on the nature of those events themselves my travels led me to where i am today sometimes these steps have felt painful difficult but led me to greater happiness and opportunites if someday they say of me that in my work i have contributed something to the welfare and happiness of my fellow man i shall be satisfied my mother was a public school teacher in virginia and we didnt have any money we just survived on happiness on being a happy family i think a child may be the only thing that could give me true happiness my happiness doesnt come from money or fame my happiness comes from seeing life without struggle it was physically difficult adjusting to wheelchair life but i remember a great relief and happiness that i was finally getting somewhere finding musicians to work with that were sympathetic i see happiness as a byproduct i dont think you can pursue happiness i think that phrase is one of the very few mistakes the founding fathers made im passionate about everything like my family and friends anybody i am talkin to is gonna be bona fide real there is no substitution for happiness period genuine happiness comes from within and often it comes in spontaneous feelings of joy i dont really care how i am remembered as long as i bring happiness and joy to people i am deeply convinced that happiness does not exist in this world i love walking down the street and seeing faces and drama and happiness and sadness and dirt and cleanliness so even though i consider myself a fairly upbeat person energetic and things like that i never do very well on happiness tests those in the west who dismiss the repressiveness of laws against women in countries like iran no matter how benign their intentions present a condescending view not just of the religion but also of women living in muslim majority countries as if the desire for choice and happiness is the monopoly of women in the west i dont have the recipe for happiness but i think the engine is simply having the desire when i was a little kid all i wanted to do was to escape what i thought was the country and get to a city probably film and television had influenced me so much i really thought the key to happiness was living a very artificial life in a penthouse in new york with martini glasses could a government dare to set out with happiness as its goal now that there are accepted scientific proofs it would be easy to audit the progress of national happiness annually just as we monitor money and gdp each person is living for himself his own happiness is all he can ever personally feel every happiness is a hostage to fortune joe e lewis said money doesnt buy happiness but it calms the nerves and that is how i feel about a film being wellreceived the cause of justice is the cause of humanity its advocates should overflow with universal good will we should love this cause for it conduces to the general happiness of mankind people need to realise what real happiness and success is because success as an actor is fleeting you can be up there one day and gone the next your dear baby has died innocent and blameless and has been called away by an all wise and merciful creator most probably from a life to misery and misfortune and most certainly to one of happiness and bliss every man judges his own happiness and satisfaction with life in terms of his possession or lack of possession of those things that he considers worthwhile and valuable as long as i am given the opportunity to keep performing and keep exploring in whatever medium ill be happy as long as i get to spend time with my family ill be happy as long as i can write in some form ill be happy it is the essential things like that i equate with happiness what i mean by that is that the point of life as i see it is not to write books or scale mountains or sail oceans but to achieve happiness and preferably an unselfish happiness i think people really marry far too much it is such a lottery after all and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness heartache is very fertile ground for songmaking but so is happiness so is absolute bliss there once was a demographic survey done to determine if money was connected to happiness and ireland was the only place where this did not turn out to be true goodness does not more certainly make men happy than happiness makes them good i think money is essential to happiness and right now i wouldnt want to be anyone other than wilbur smith  ive had a fantastic life rewarded far more heavily than i deserve maybe id like to be j k rowling but ill settle for second best aye im tellin ye happiness is one of the few things in this world that doubles every time you share it with someone else you can have a lot of unhappiness by not having money but the reverse is no guarantee of happiness happiness must be cultivated it is like character it is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment or it will run to weeds when you analyze happiness it turns out that the way you spend your time is extremely important households cities countries and nations have enjoyed great happiness when a single individual has taken heed of the good and beautiful such people not only liberate themselves they fill those they meet with a free mind this nation is notorious for its ability to make or fake anything cheaply madeinchina goods now fill homes around the world but our giant country has a small problem we cant manufacture the happiness of our people trifles make up the happiness or the misery of human life happiness or misery is in the mind it is the mind that lives even if happiness forgets you a little bit never completely forget about it ive often thought if i didnt make my marriage work i would have failed at my one true shot at happiness how often we fail to realize our good fortune in living in a country where happiness is more than a lack of tragedy we all agree that its fit to be as happy as we can and we need no instructor to teach us this knowledge tis born with us and is inseparable from our being but we very much need to be informd what is the true way to happiness if i have to apply five turns to the screw each day for the happiness of argentina i will do it feminisms agenda is basic it asks that women not be forced to choose between public justice and private happiness scarcely one person in a thousand is capable of tasting the happiness of others happiness lies first of all in health the slave may be happy but happiness is not enough happiness i do not know where to turn to discover you on earth in the air or the sky yet i know you exist and are no futile dream the greatest happiness comes from being vitally interested in something that excites all your energies life is made up of small pleasures happiness is made up of those tiny successes the big ones come too infrequently and if you dont collect all these tiny successes the big ones dont really mean anything the greatest happiness is to transform ones feelings into action i love acting its my playground it lets me explore but my happiness in this world  my level of peace  is never going to be dictated by acting but my happiness in this world  my level of peace  is never going to be dictated by acting seek happiness for its own sake and you will not find it seek for duty and happiness will follow as the shadow comes with the sunshine i had to try and find a way to express happiness without sounding corny history shows that our way of life is the stronger way from it has come more wealth more industry more happiness more human enlightenment than from any other way happiness doesnt depend on how much you have to enjoy but how much you enjoy what you have there is even a happiness  that makes the heart afraid the pop musicians often leave meaning in the dust and substitute it for cartoons the deeper artists  the grunge artists in the world and the emoticon people  tend to leave all of the happiness out of life like it just doesnt exist i dont like paris so much and its only eight shows i mean dont tell them that of course but everyone always thinks theyre so important and im sure they are but to me my happiness is more important when kate was born she was born into a world of joy and happiness and confidence the difference between the children is night and day shes happy shes thriving shes full of selfconfidence i tell her shes beautiful every day before i send her off to school shall i give you my recipe for happiness i find everything useful and nothing indispensable i find everything wonderful and nothing miraculous i reverence the body i avoid first causes like the plague i visited those friends whod just had a baby and she was washing dishes and he was cleaning the house and i burst with happiness and in their minds they were in this terrible domestic rut the divine of the lord in heaven is love for the reason that love is receptive of all things of heaven such as peace intelligence wisdom and happiness is anyone serious about the politics of happiness david cameron dipped a toe in the water using the word lightly but denying the hard policies it implies labour shies away from it but should take up the challenge happiness is a real objective phenomenon scientifically verifiable that means people and whole societies can now be measured over time and compared accurately with one another causes and cures for unhappiness can be quantified inequality makes everyone unhappy the poor most of all and that is well within the remit of the state more money gives less extra happiness the richer we get yet we are addicted to earning and spending more every year inside every adult theres still a child that lingers were happiness merchants  giving people the opportunity to dream like children you find happiness where you find it i love my family and i had a very wonderful magical childhood but new jersey was actually a very cold place there was such an intense concentration of wealth and such a low concentration of any actual human happiness the people have a right to the truth as they have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness while i gave up god a long time ago i never shook the habit of wanting to believe in something so i replaced my creed of everlasting life with life liberty and the pursuit of happiness its up to you to be responsible for how you feel if youre not happy your happiness lies in your hands you cant rely on a man to make you happy or complete you that starts with you i dont get a sense of american pride i just get a sense that everyone is here battling the same thing  that around the world everybodys after the same thing just some minor piece of happiness each day happiness for you we walk on a knife edge to the eyes you are a flickering light to the feet thin ice that cracks and so may no one touch you who loves you my greatest happiness is to serve my gracious king and country and i am envious only of glory for if it be a sin to covet glory i am the most offending soul alive im actually tougher on myself as i get older its a vicious cycle the things that are important in life are the things that you cant buy in life love health and happiness i say that and i believe that and i try to live that i will never forget my beautiful days with you in shanklin they are certainly the most pleasant ones of my life look i have tears in my eyes just to think about it i am furious to be here it is the end of happiness for a whole year the most simple things can bring the most happiness you need characters who want things they want love they want recognition they want happiness the women i know who have children and have careers they seem to be very happy they love their children and they love their jobs but happiness comes out of being willing to do your work in your twenties to find out who you are what you love real happiness is cheap enough yet how dearly we pay for its counterfeit suspicion is far more to be wrong than right more often unjust than just it is no friend to virtue and always an enemy to happiness the idea that happiness could have a share in beauty would be too much of a good thing getting pregnant wasnt easy and i found that devastating i really beat myself up for waiting so long when id always wanted children and family had been the basis of my happiness my whole life i get way too much happiness from good food the secret of happiness is the determination to be happy always rather than wait for outer circumstances to make one happy man must search for what is right and let happiness come on its own musicians are probably the most uncomfortable people in themselves in the world happiness i think only exists when youre a child and once you go past 11 unfortunately its gone we learn the inner secret of happiness when we learn to direct our inner drives our interest and our attention to something besides ourselves you do the right thing even if it makes you feel bad the purpose of life is not to be happy but to be worthy of happiness its not attractive when girls get superskinny guys dont like it girls dont like you as much you lose some happiness when thats all you think about my mum brought me up to think that personal happiness is more important than your family i think my capacity to change has given me tremendous happiness because who i am today i am completely content to be i have to keep reminding myself if you give your life to god he doesnt promise you happiness and that everything will go well but he does promise you peace you can have peace and joy even in bad circumstances the happiness of every country depends upon the character of its people rather than the form of its government the older i get the more i see that there really arent huge zeniths of happiness or a huge abyss of darkness as much as there used to be i tend to walk a middle ground i find that the older i get the more i see that there really arent huge zeniths of happiness or a huge abyss of darkness as much as there used to be some days are just bad days thats all you have to experience sadness to know happiness and i remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day thats just the way it is money is not necessarily although it helps a lot for happiness its not necessarily the best way to be happy to be rich you know for me however that beloved glowing little word happiness has become associated with everything i have felt since childhood upon hearing the sound of the word itself nevertheless whether in occurrences lasting days hours or mere minutes at a time i have experienced happiness often and have had brief encounters with it in my later years even in old age fame is indeed beautiful and benign and gentle and satisfying but happiness is something at once tender and brilliant beyond all things i want fame more than i can tell but more than i want fame i want happiness if happiness truly consisted in physical ease and freedom from care then the happiest individual would not be either a man or a woman it would be i think an american cow happiness is no laughing matter i come before you to declare that my sex are entitled to the inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the house a woman creates is a utopia she cant help it  cant help trying to interest her nearest and dearest not in happiness itself but in the search for it now an infinite happiness cannot be purchased by any price less than that which is infinite in value and infinity of merit can only result from a nature that is infinitely divine or perfect the free market economy is supposed to be the only path leading to the happiness of humanity by promoting wealth and prosperity power and influence of nations so after awhile you can only get so much happiness from a guy whos drunk come up and tell you youre great the inspired scriptures make the clear distinction between false and true riches and make plain the reason why happiness is gained and fully enjoyed only by those who find true riches friends have suggested that i am the least qualified person to talk about happiness because i am often down and sometimes profoundly depressed but i think thats where my qualification comes from because to know happiness it helps to know unhappiness by asking the question am i happy and via the answer setting out what i mean by happiness there is a political route that can be taken by asking another question  can politics deliver happiness and should it try so here is one of my theories on happiness we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end this view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of philip gould philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics when he died i felt like i had lost a limb yes women and men have to be open to love because if were not open then theres no way for us to find happiness but you can be open to it and still have no control over when its going to happen so i started chanting when i was nineteen which was about twelve years ago and it really had a huge impact on my outlook happiness and general creativity this is true enough but success is the next best thing to happiness and if you cant be happy as a success its very unlikely that you would find a deeper truer happiness in failure every man hath a general desire of his own happiness and likewise a variety of particular affections passions and appetites to particular external objects happiness or satisfaction consists only in the enjoyment of those objects which are by nature suited to our several particular appetites passions and affections the principle we call selflove never seeks anything external for the sake of the thing but only as a means of happiness or good particular affections rest in the external things themselves the sum of the whole is plainly this the nature of man considered in his single capacity and with respect only to the present world is adapted and leads him to attain the greatest happiness he can for himself in the present world my parents were not very happy they were very worried about me pursuing a career that even if i had talent might not give me the happiness and the success that they  any parent hopes for their child some of us learned in a school of philosophy which taught that all was for the common good and nothing for oneself and have never in any case regarded the pursuit of happiness as anything other than an aberration of the human spirit i think essentially the meaning of life is probably the journey and not really any one thing or an outcome or a result i think its kinda the process and i think that if you can find happiness in the process then maybe thats it happiness does not come from football awards its terrible to correlate happiness with football happiness comes from a good job being able to feed your wife and kids i dont dream football i dream the american dream  two cars in a garage be a happy father ive had a good life enough happiness enough success the independence of all political and other bother is a happiness to have the sense of creative activity is the great happiness and the great proof of being alive only one thing has to change for us to know happiness in our lives where we focus our attention happiness is making your dreams come true individuality is the aim of political liberty by leaving the citizen as much freedom of action and of being as comports with order and the rights of others the institutions render him truly a freeman he is left to pursue his means of happiness in his own manner i just hope i can spread some of the happiness thats been coming my way money brings some happiness but after a certain point it just brings more money i think government has a major role to play in helping us with the pursuit of happiness sadness is a very interesting idea this idea of sadness being some kind of default setting that artists will go into and then i started thinking about this idea of sadness and happiness and the idea that sadness is very loud and happiness is quiet happiness is like a cat if you try to coax it or call it it will avoid you it will never come but if you pay not attention to it and go about your business youll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap happiness is not that easy to achieve but having a handsome husband a beautiful baby and a great job helps to me the most important thing is happiness the music is the message the message is the music so thats my little ministry that the big man upstairs gave to me  a little ministry called love and happiness the life and liberty and property and happiness of the common man throughout the world are at the absolute mercy of a few persons whom he has never seen involved in complicated quarrels that he has never heard of its obvious but perhaps worth saying that happiness has virtually nothing to do with the state of your intellect one of my producers said this business is like a hamster on that little wheel thing that goes around and around you may have a great day and get great ratings but then youve got another show to do  whatever moment of success or happiness you have youve got to keep grinding it out for the next day the arts are weapons of understanding and weapons of happiness i envy the happiness of others i envy the sense of belonging i seem always to be remaking myself i believe there is a relationship between having an interest in the arts and the behaviour of society as a whole some politicians find it difficult that the arts is a weapon of happiness politics is often about deprivation rather than the opening up of ideas and nourishing creative endeavour to seduce a woman famous for strict morals religious fervor and the happiness of her marriage what could possibly be more prestigious many a happiness in life as many a disaster can be due to chance but the peace within us can never be governed by chance happiness is rarely absent it is we that know not of its presence the object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or of races but the happiness of common man mystery is gone to the certainty of technological principles so the real terror the real aggression against life comes in the form of the pursuit of our technological happiness the arrival of any child brings you a lot of happiness we have a long heritage of freedom that defines america we believe there is a creator who blessed us with life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in securing the future of the planet we secure happiness for ourselves one of the aims of the greens is to turn around the tide of pessimism amongst the young people of the world but if you believe in christ and that your main goal with your life is supposed to be to honor him and do his will then you dont have as much pressure as someone who bases all their happiness on whether theyre a movie star i think people should know more of africa in terms of its joie de vivre its feeling for life in spite of the images that one knows about africa  the economic poverty the corruption  theres a joy to living and a happiness in community living together in community life which may be missing here in america the only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose happiness is the absence of suffering i think its an interesting way of looking at it i think the absence of suffering exists very rarely in the world we live in i am deeply grateful for the concern of all those who constantly prayed for my happiness eventually we reach the point where we start to realize that we are not going to find peace contentment happiness strength fearlessness  all of the things that in our heart of hearts we wish we had  outside of us happiness for me is getting to write about the most important things i know my biography of frank sinatra is not paean to his music but rather an illumination of the man behind the music who once described himself as an 18karat manicdepressive who lived a life of violent emotional contradictions with an overacute capacity for sadness as well as happiness bring love and peace and happiness and beautiful lives into the world in my honor thank you love you theres a higher form of happiness in commitment im counting on it first and foremost youve got to make yourself happy essentially being who you are is the most important thing when youre after truth happiness always comes you know american citizens i dont think ever thought that the right to the pursuit of happiness did not include the right to marry the person you love but for a whole number of americans gay americans that happens to be true according to your sympathy you will take pleasure in your own happiness or in the happiness of other people but it is always your own happiness you seek fashion is all about happiness its fun its important but its not medicine ive had at least my share of tragedy but i have had far more than my share of happiness for my part i do not feel that the scheme of future happiness which ought by rights to be in preparation for me will be at all interfered with by my not meeting again the man i have in my mind happiness has a bad rap people say it shouldnt be your goal in life oh yes it should more company increases happiness but does not lighten or diminish misery happiness was not made to be boasted but enjoyed therefore tho others count me miserable i will not believe them if i know and feel myself to be happy nor fear them to think the world therefore a general bedlam or place of madmen and oneself a physician is the most necessary point of present wisdom an important imagination and the way to happiness but it is my happiness to be half welsh and that the better half we need fundamental change in the past national development led to peoples happiness but now the link between national growth and improvement in peoples lives has been severed time the great destroyer of other mens happiness only enlarges the patrimony of literature to its possessor there is no dramatic difference in happiness on the part of people who are wealthy well my thoughts about california are kind of mythological to me as well as being a real place its a place where people go to find something  to find happiness or to realize their dreams so it has that kind of quality of heroism and heartache and australia has that as well i used to wonder if it was gods plan that i should be alone for so much of my life but i found peace i found happiness within people and the world the lesson i have thoroughly learnt and wish to pass on to others is to know the enduring happiness that the love of a garden gives politics are beautiful they enable a community to live collectively with one another its not about stabbing each other in the back its about enabling people to reach their dreams and pursue happiness i have a theory that the secret of marital happiness is simple drink in different pubs to your other half there may be peace without joy and joy without peace but the two combined make happiness well may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring responsibilities on which may depend our countrys peace and prosperity and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family an order of government established by such an allwise powerful being must be good and perfect and must be calculated to promote the permanent peace happiness and wellbeing of all his subjects michael has a connection with children just like mickey mouse does and he brings happiness to them and joy may there always be peace love and happiness in every house ones happiness depends less on what he knows than on what he feels if kind parents love their children and delight in their happiness then he who is perfect goodness in sending abroad mortal contagions doth assuredly direct their use every age has its happiness and troubles happiness is not a possession to be prized it is a quality of thought a state of mind traveling is the ruin of all happiness theres no looking at a building after seeing italy as long as you are being true to yourself you will always find happiness im an inherently happy person it comes from the inside which means you can achieve happiness under any circumstance the secret of happiness is to find a congenial monotony happiness consists not in having much but in being content with little i was as happy doing theater in new york for little or no money as i am now doing television for more money the happiness i guess comes out of it being a good job the success has to do with the fact that its a good job that will continue our nation was founded on the principals of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the united states are a political state or organized society whose end is government for the security welfare and happiness of all who live under its protection as a bookish child in calcutta i used to thrill to the adventures of bad girls whose pursuit of happiness swept them outside the bounds of social decency tess of the durbervilles emma bovary and anna karenina lived large in my imagination the naughty girls of hollywood films flirted and knew how to drive success can create more madness than happiness i ask the rights to pursue happiness by having a voice in that government to which i am accountable the secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it happiness is being on the beam with life  to feel the pull of life there is no such thing as the pursuit of happiness but there is the discovery of joy my family didnt have a lot of money and im grateful for that money is the longest route to happiness i always had a larger view im interested in real life  my family my friends i have tried never to define myself by my success whatever that is my happiness is way beyond roles and awards before the boat docked however he confessed because he was contemplating running for president he couldnt separate from his wife i believed him when he told me he faced a difficult choice between pursuing personal happiness and his political destiny so many people have said that to me that what they really like about alex is what she brings out in marissa and what this situation brings out in her a hint of happiness and another side to her character leibniz dedicated his life to efforts to educate people to understand that true happiness is found by locating their identity in benefitting mankind and their posterity being rich and famous isnt all happiness and at times the pressures have got to me i always looked for a man to rescue me and bring me happiness i bought into that myth of course and looked for my own prince charming for all its terrible faults in one sense america is still the last best hope of mankind because it spells out so vividly the kind of happiness that most people actually want regardless of what they are told they ought to want virtue is simply happiness and happiness is a byproduct of function you are happy when you are functioning fancy the happiness of pinocchio on finding himself free without saying yes or no he fled from the city and set out on the road that was to take him back to the house of the lovely fairy the folly of endless consumerism sends us on a wild goosechase for happiness through materialism there is no happiness outside of ourselves i have kids and i want to have a long life and there are certain things that are conducive to that and certain things that arent ive opted for the road of happiness and long life i keep mementos from everything ive done ive got my cab drivers license from happiness ive got a pair of glasses and a belt buckle from playing john lennon ive got a pair of sunglasses from playing andy warhol its all in a box in the garage vegas means comedy tragedy happiness and sadness all at the same time he who never sacrificed a present to a future good or a personal to a general one can speak of happiness only as the blind do of colors it is our happiness to live under the government of a prince who is satisfied with ruling according to law as every other good prince will  we enjoy under his administration all the liberty that is proper and expedient for us character is power it makes friends draws patronage and support and opens the way to wealth honor and happiness we all of us deserve happiness or none of us does you always hear the phrase money doesnt buy you happiness but i always in the back of my mind figured a lot of money will buy you a little bit of happiness but its not really true i got a new car because the old ones lease expired the sexes were made for each other and only in the wise and loving union of the two is the fullness of health and duty and happiness to be expected for mythology is the handmaid of literature and literature is one of the best allies of virtue and promoters of happiness ive never seen an obese person who has said i am well in my mind happiness stops food being a compensation happiness to some elation is to others mere stagnation im interested in the dark side of man im interested in taboos and murder is the greatest taboo characters are fascinating in their extremity not in their happiness id learned how much happiness money can bring you very little happiness is the real sense of fulfillment that comes from hard work i have a talent for happiness i look with the eyes of a painter and i see beauty the one happiness is to shut ones door upon a little room with a table before one and to create to create life in that isolation from life the groundwork of all happiness is health its good to follow the path of personal happiness to some extent people tend to get upset however when you drive a steamroller down it happiness consists in activity it is running steam not a stagnant pool the pursuit of happiness is in our constitution were all entitled to have the best we can see to do good and you will find that happiness will run after you to me flowers are happiness we all have to work for happiness and you cannot listen to other people that is the worst mistake you can make happiness consumes itself like a flame it cannot burn for ever it must go out and the presentiment of its end destroys it at its very peak money cant buy happiness marriage is wild i thought it was this perfect land of happiness and joy wrong after you say you do you dont for a long time if you can measure success in this business based on happiness alone i feel like ive hit the lottery experienced happiness refers to your feelings to how happy you are as you live your life in contrast the satisfaction of the remembering self refers to your feelings when you think about your life i believe economic growth should translate into the happiness and progress of all along with it there should be development of art and culture literature and education science and technology we have to see how to harness the many resources of india for achieving common good and for inclusive growth so i decided to move that scene in the doctors office to twothirds into the movie after the viewers had come to know ryan and ali and share in their happiness what happiness is there which is not purchased with more or less of pain if you asked somebody what do you wish for in life they wouldnt say happiness i would have answered excitement knowledge god knows  i mean many many different things but certainly not happiness it seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular as long as you understand that you find happiness through family friends and love then money is just a nice bonus 90 100 are going there to hear the singing the story is another thing nobodys interested in the story happiness is happiness even when there are times that were not happy happiness will creep in it is great happiness to be praised of them who are most praiseworthy law is stable the societies we are speaking of are progressive the greater or less happiness of a people depends on the degree of promptitude with which the gulf is narrowed in my life ive learned that true happiness comes from giving helping others along the way makes you evaluate who you are i think that love is what were all searching for i havent come across anyone who didnt become a better person through love the truth is that relative income is not directly related to happiness nonpartisan socialsurvey data clearly show that the big driver of happiness is earned success a persons belief that he has created value in his life or the life of others i dont know why my smile has become a signature pose i think its a nice change i think people want to see happiness so a smile is what can bring that i didnt make it my trademark on purpose happiness is when you love who you are and you are able to accept yourself and others it is the people who can do nothing who find nothing to do and the secret to happiness in this world is not only to be useful but to be forever elevating ones uses clothes are my drug i love camden market  i have so many vintage pieces from there its unbelievable clothes are really important to me they give me that feeling of happiness i love being a bit free with it all and not giving myself rules since therefore no man is born without faults and he is esteemed the best whose errors are the least let the wise man consider everything human as connected with himself for in worldly affairs there is no perfect happiness under heaven the thing is when i had my first success it did coincide with the end of my first marriage and because i went on to have a very very unhappy two years i dont think i equate career success with personal happiness we hear of the wealth of nations of the powers of production of the demand and supply of markets and we forget that these words mean no more if they mean any thing then the happiness and the labor and the necessities of men that which makes people dissatisfied with their condition is the chimerical idea they form of the happiness of others with respect to the first of these obstacles it has often been made a matter of grave complaint against political economists that they confine their attention to wealth and disregard all consideration of happiness or virtue ive done an informal anecdotal survey about marriage and ive found no evidence that it brings happiness i find happiness comes from numerous sources in my life most often the happy moments i cherish most are quiet moments with my wife and family back home in nova scotia the applause was so loud and insistent that i had to respond with several encores i was numb with happiness when it was over i knew that this alone must be my life and my world although one may fail to find happiness in theatrical life one never wishes to give it up after having once tasted its fruits my grandmother had six kids  one died as an infant  and she was dirtpoor and all her kids got an education and my mom grew up poor and they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness i wanted to have that like an amulet not like armor but like a magic feather like dumbos magic feather the path i am trying so hard to follow is in fact the one that god my father and his son jesus christ want me to pursue it has brought me deep happiness this is why i belong and why i believe i commend to all this same search for happiness and for the truth heaven takes care that no man secures happiness by crime to comprehend the wisdom of this injunction the better and explain the duty before us it should be considered that government is the only means by which human happiness can be attained if we did not look to marriage as the principal source of happiness fewer marriages would end in tears the fabric of north carolina and what makes our state so special is our families and our common desire for a brighter future for our children no matter what your family looks like we all want the same thing for our families  happiness health prosperity a bright future for our children and grandchildren we have arrived at that point of time in which we are forced to see our own humiliation as a nation and that a progression in this line cannot be a productive of happiness private or public every moment of your life that is not a complete nightmare is happiness eternal principles that govern happiness apply equally to all i think i am missing a gene that most people have to enable them to feel happiness about success and these kind of things happiness a way station between too little and too much when i first found out that i was an idol finalist i cried tears of happiness i was just so happy and my family was there and the fact that got to see that moment and share that moment with me was just everything to me from the taoist point of view the natural result of this harmonious way of living is happiness the secular world looks to the church and to its chagrin finds no love no life no laughter no hope and no happiness by mere burial man arrives not at bliss and in the future life throughout its whole infinite range they will seek for happiness as vainly as they sought it here who seek it in aught else than that which so closely surrounds them here  the infinite sitting behind the bench at games is the hardest thing ive ever had to go through because basketball is really most of my happiness so when i cant go out there and exert energy and have fun and things like that it kind of puts everything else into perspective in civilized life where the happiness and indeed almost the existence of man depends on the opinion of his fellow men he is constantly acting a studied part i knew everything and received everything but real happiness is giving i always remembered that when i saw people get married they got on a rocketship and went to planet happiness population them some of you read with me 40 years ago a portion of aristotles ethics a selection of passages that describe his idea of happiness you may not remember too well the last part the part youre now approaching was for aristotle the most important for happiness happiness is not a matter of events it depends upon the tides of the mind the only real happiness a ballplayer has is when he is playing a ball game and accomplishes something he didnt think he could do we pray that every field of science may contribute in bringing happiness  not disaster  to human beings happiness is only real when shared and in fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources contributes to unhappiness but the increase in material resources do not increase happiness i love being on stage im completely totally relaxed its the only time in my life when i know where i am and whats coming next the other robert powell is probably fairly melancholic lets just say happiness isnt my default position there are dark parts im very good at it i frighten people sometimes hope is itself a species of happiness and perhaps the chief happiness which this world affords id rather have happiness than money people ask for it sometimes when i dont have it i make other peoples problems my problem because they want me to they ask me to so many people equate money and success with happiness especially in the music industry let us never know what old age is let us know the happiness time brings not count the years five or six hundred heads cut off would have assured your repose freedom and happiness i say there is not more happiness for me than the freedom of my homeland your destiny is my destiny your happiness is my happiness i learned that people everywhere are basically the same and have similar goals that we do they want health and happiness and the opportunity to provide for their families there is nothing can pay one for that invaluable ignorance which is the companion of youth those sanguine groundless hopes and that lively vanity which makes all the happiness of life a face is too slight a foundation for happiness we are selling dreams we are merchants of happiness the gods conceal from men the happiness of death that they may endure life lots of people i know have bootlegged tapes of performances and if they play it i will be transported back sometimes with happiness sometimes with horror too much good fortune can make you smug and unaware happiness should be like an oasis the greener for the desert that surrounds it happiness is realizing that nothing is too important no true and permanent fame can be founded except in labors which promote the happiness of mankind no period of my life has been one of such unmixed happiness as the four years which have been spent within college walls religion is of general and public concern and on its support depend in great measure the peace and good order of government the safety and happiness of the people it is not only my laboratory and my place of work but also my home so that on the 30th october i was able to share my happiness immediately with my students and collaborators and at the same time with my wife and family when the honour is given to that scientist personally the happiness is sweet indeed science is on the whole an informal activity a life of shirt sleeves and coffee served in beakers the crown of life is neither happiness nor annihilation it is understanding happiness is the sublime moment when you get out of your corsets at night although freud said happiness is composed of love and work reality often forces us to choose love or work money cannot buy happiness the bourbon king was first ambassador of reason and human happiness happiness comes from some curious adjustment to life life is full of happiness and tears be strong and have faith i can only point out a curious fact year after year the nobel awards bring a moment of happiness not only to the recipients not only to colleagues and friends of the recipients but even to strangers the principles we live by in business and in social life are the most important part of happiness a good education is another name for happiness it was a joy to be a part of the team that created round the horne i was involved with the show at a time of my life when i was very happy and that happiness overflowed into the scripts that action is best which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers it is in his knowledge that man has found his greatness and his happiness the high superiority which he holds over the other animals who inhabit the earth with him and consequently no ignorance is probably without loss to him no error without evil purring would seem to be in her case an automatic safety valve device for dealing with happiness overflow the unproductive tillage of human cattle takes that which of right belongs to free labor and which is necessary for the support and happiness of our own race there is only one real happiness in life and that is the happiness of creating what is the worth of anything but for the happiness twill bring in hollywood if you dont have happiness you send out for it on a soap happiness never lasts for very long in three words i can sum up everything ive learned about life it goes on do not dwell in the past do not dream of the future concentrate the mind on the present moment throughout life people will make you mad disrespect you and treat you bad let god deal with the things they do cause hate in your heart will consume you too life is a song  sing it life is a game  play it life is a challenge  meet it life is a dream  realize it life is a sacrifice  offer it life is love  enjoy it a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing when i stand before god at the end of my life i would hope that i would not have a single bit of talent left and could say i used everything you gave me never be bullied into silence never allow yourself to be made a victim accept no ones definition of your life define yourself believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact dont go around saying the world owes you a living the world owes you nothing it was here first i still find each day too short for all the thoughts i want to think all the walks i want to take all the books i want to read and all the friends i want to see you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life all life is an experiment the more experiments you make the better life is a dream for the wise a game for the fool a comedy for the rich a tragedy for the poor change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future life is really simple but we insist on making it complicated how far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young compassionate with the aged sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong because someday in your life you will have been all of these the truth is you dont know what is going to happen tomorrow life is a crazy ride and nothing is guaranteed open your eyes look within are you satisfied with the life youre living life is what happens while you are busy making other plans go confidently in the direction of your dreams live the life you have imagined a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them  that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like my formula for living is quite simple i get up in the morning and i go to bed at night in between i occupy myself as best i can only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile i have a simple philosophy fill whats empty empty whats full scratch where it itches any idiot can face a crisis  its day to day living that wears you out the most important thing is to enjoy your life  to be happy  its all that matters we must let go of the life we have planned so as to accept the one that is waiting for us lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day change your life today dont gamble on the future act now without delay every man dies not every man really lives i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived if you love life dont waste time for time is what life is made up of a man sooner or later discovers that he is the mastergardener of his soul the director of his life all the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on good friends good books and a sleepy conscience this is the ideal life our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts we need to give each other the space to grow to be ourselves to exercise our diversity we need to give each other space so that we may both give and receive such beautiful things as ideas openness dignity joy healing and inclusion he who has a why to live can bear almost any how a baby is gods opinion that life should go on to live a pure unselfish life one must count nothing as ones own in the midst of abundance remember when lifes path is steep to keep your mind even life is like dancing if we have a big floor many people will dance some will get angry when the rhythm changes but life is changing all the time when we remember we are all mad the mysteries disappear and life stands explained life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood we must be willing to let go of the life we have planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us the price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it dont go through life grow through life life is 10 percent what you make it and 90 percent how you take it the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are it is not length of life but depth of life every creature is better alive than dead men and moose and pine trees and he who understands it aright will rather preserve its life than destroy it dont let life discourage you everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was here is the test to find whether your mission on earth is finished if youre alive it isnt i slept and dreamt that life was joy i awoke and saw that life was service i acted and behold service was joy a person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body  the wishbone there are three constants in life change choice and principles its all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced my life is my message the true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life i love those who yearn for the impossible i love life because what more is there i dont believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well life loves the liver of it nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less once you say youre going to settle for second thats what happens to you in life life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about the courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy i do not regret one moment of my life our life is what our thoughts make it beware the barrenness of a busy life the shoe that fits one person pinches another there is no recipe for living that suits all cases everything has been figured out except how to live the only disability in life is a bad attitude if life were predictable it would cease to be life and be without flavor who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies when life is too easy for us we must beware or we may not be ready to meet the blows which sooner or later come to everyone rich or poor i think ive discovered the secret of life  you just hang around until you get used to it what we think determines what happens to us so if we want to change our lives we need to stretch our minds doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life everything in life is luck use your health even to the point of wearing it out that is what it is for spend all you have before you die do not outlive yourself life is a series of collisions with the future it is not the sum of what we have been but what we yearn to be with the past i have nothing to do nor with the future i live now the story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye the story of love is hello goodbye most people have never learned that one of the main aims in life is to enjoy it the aim of life is to live and to live means to be aware joyously drunkenly serenely divinely aware life consists in what a man is thinking of all day not life but good life is to be chiefly valued life becomes harder for us when we live for others but it also becomes richer and happier a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives i have found that if you love life life will love you back may you live all the days of your life a healthful hunger for a great idea is the beauty and blessedness of life life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh to affect the quality of the day that is the highest of arts life is a tragedy when seen in closeup but a comedy in longshot the art of living is more like wrestling than dancing begin at once to live and count each separate day as a separate life look i dont want to wax philosophic but i will say that if youre alive youve got to flap your arms and legs youve got to jump around a lot for life is the very opposite of death and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully or youre not alive when i hear somebody sigh life is hard i am always tempted to ask compared to what people living deeply have no fear of death a wellspent day brings happy sleep fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts life itself still remains a very effective therapist life in abundance comes only through great love the greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes what is important in life is life and not the result of life you have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need an aim in life is the only fortune worth finding i look back on my life like a good days work it was done and i am satisfied with it while theres life theres hope get correct views of life and learn to see the world in its true light it will enable you to live pleasantly to do good and when summoned away to leave without regret life is a long lesson in humility life is half spent before we know what it is life must be lived as play maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets there is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner that in the dinner the sweets come last one way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure kindness ive discovered is everything in life unbeing dead isnt being alive to change ones life start immediately do it flamboyantly life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs this life is worth living we can say since it is what we make it life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome the purpose of life is a life of purpose we are all here for a spell get all the good laughs you can the greatest pleasure of life is love the great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it our business in life is not to succeed but to continue to fail in good spirits the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge while we are postponing life speeds by there is just one life for each of us our own the basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy but that it is a bore it is not so much a war as an endless standing in line a chain is no stronger than its weakest link and life is after all a chain life is never easy for those who dream life is too short to work so hard the chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions we are here to add what we can to life not to get what we can from life for the happiest life days should be rigorously planned nights left open to chance life well spent is long if you live long enough youll make mistakes but if you learn from them youll be a better person its how you handle adversity not how it affects you the main thing is never quit never quit never quit life is something to do when you cant get to sleep life isnt a matter of milestones but of moments we cant plan life all we can do is be available for it life will always be to a large extent what we ourselves make it life is wasted on the living life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself the art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much the most exhausting thing in life is being insincere the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death life is a succession of moments to live each one is to succeed there is no wealth but life life is largely a matter of expectation give me the luxuries of life and i will willingly do without the necessities the indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this decide what you want i take a simple view of life it is keep your eyes open and get on with it seventy percent of success in life is showing up life is not an exact science it is an art every man regards his own life as the new years eve of time to live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else what a wonderful life ive had i only wish id realized it sooner life is like a trumpet  if you dont put anything into it you dont get anything out of it i take care of my flowers and my cats and enjoy food and thats living no man is a failure who is enjoying life the man who has no innerlife is a slave to his surroundings wrong life cannot be lived rightly life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises life is anything that dies when you stomp on it my life is every moment of my life it is not a culmination of the past life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act to me if life boils down to one thing its movement to live is to keep moving i did not direct my life i didnt design it i never made decisions things always came up and made them for me thats what life is human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning to live is to change and to be perfect is to have changed often our entire life  consists ultimately in accepting ourselves as we are to know nothing is the happiest life to be free is to have achieved your life varietys the very spice of life that gives it all its flavor you dont have to be the dalai lama to tell people that lifes about change life is but thought life itself is the proper binge the whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work  that goes on it adds up life is a culmination of the past an awareness of the present an indication of a future beyond knowledge the quality that gives a touch of divinity to matter the less routine the more life life is much shorter than i imagined it to be life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul the indian summer of life should be a little sunny and a little sad like the season and infinite in wealth and depth of tone but never hustled any life is made up of a single moment the moment in which a man finds out once and for all who he is what we play is life life is a great sunrise i do not see why death should not be an even greater one life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious the fear of life is the favorite disease of the 20th century life has a higher end than to be amused the person lives twice who lives the first life well unrest of spirit is a mark of life life itself still remains a very effective therapist life is a lot like jazz its best when you improvise i have inspiration and feelings of being alive most every day i live i had no blood relatives till i made some keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead i believe that if life gives you lemons you should make lemonade and try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka and have a party where there is love there is life life is one big road with lots of signs so when you riding through the ruts dont complicate your mind flee from hate mischief and jealousy dont bury your thoughts put your vision to reality wake up and live ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career ive lost almost 300 games 26 times ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed if you dont design your own life plan chances are youll fall into someone elses plan and guess what they have planned for you not much thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle and the life of the candle will not be shortened happiness never decreases by being shared i hated every minute of training but i said dont quit suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion in everyones life at some time our inner fire goes out it is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being we should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit you have enemies good that means youve stood up for something sometime in your life do not take life too seriously you will never get out of it alive take up one idea make that one idea your life  think of it dream of it live on that idea let the brain muscles nerves every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone this is the way to success our prime purpose in this life is to help others and if you cant help them at least dont hurt them your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma  which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition in the end its not the years in your life that count its the life in your years choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how youre going to live your life ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed clouds come floating into my life no longer to carry rain or usher storm but to add color to my sunset sky life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards my mother was the most beautiful woman i ever saw all i am i owe to my mother i attribute all my success in life to the moral intellectual and physical education i received from her character develops itself in the stream of life for the past 33 years i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something i would rather live my life as if there is a god and die to find out there isnt than live my life as if there isnt and die to find out there is but friendship is precious not only in the shade but in the sunshine of life and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it i like nonsense it wakes up the brain cells fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living its a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope which is what i do and that enables you to laugh at lifes realities every moment and every event of every mans life on earth plants something in his soul lifes most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others imagine all the people living life in peace you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world will be as one life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing whatever your lifes work is do it well a man should do his job so well that the living the dead and the unborn could do it no better too often we underestimate the power of a touch a smile a kind word a listening ear an honest compliment or the smallest act of caring all of which have the potential to turn a life around your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of lifes longing for itself they came through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness it is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity all changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another all life demands struggle those who have everything given to them become lazy selfish and insensitive to the real values of life the very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today if you can dream it then you can achieve it you will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size government programs once launched never disappear actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life well ever see on this earth i cannot even imagine where i would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy lets face it friends make life a lot more fun to be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life foolish people are idle wise people are diligent imagination is everything it is the preview of lifes coming attractions im not going to change the way i look or the way i feel to conform to anything ive always been a freak so ive been a freak all my life and i have to live with that you know im one of those people god gave us the gift of life it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well just as a candle cannot burn without fire men cannot live without a spiritual life success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another learn to enjoy every minute of your life be happy now dont wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future think how really precious is the time you have to spend whether its at work or with your family every minute should be enjoyed and savored if you always put limit on everything you do physical or anything else it will spread into your work and into your life there are no limits there are only plateaus and you must not stay there you must go beyond them gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend bad things do happen how i respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life i can choose to sit in perpetual sadness immobilized by the gravity of my loss or i can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift i have  life itself the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat music is a moral law it gives soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and charm and gaiety to life and to everything again you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something  your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty anyone who keeps learning stays young the greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young when you rise in the morning give thanks for the light for your life for your strength give thanks for your food and for the joy of living if you see no reason to give thanks the fault lies in yourself we love life not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving the quality not the longevity of ones life is what is important without music life would be a mistake i believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone best both for the body and the mind people fear death even more than pain its strange that they fear death life hurts a lot more than death at the point of death the pain is over yeah i guess it is a friend just as treasures are uncovered from the earth so virtue appears from good deeds and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind to walk safely through the maze of human life one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits i remember my mothers prayers and they have always followed me they have clung to me all my life ive learned that you shouldnt go through life with a catchers mitt on both hands you need to be able to throw something back of lifes two chief prizes beauty and truth i found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborers hand you cant stop loving or wanting to love because when its right its the best thing in the world when youre in a relationship and its good even if nothing else in your life is right you feel like your whole world is complete the monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people i love being married its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life property is intended to serve life and no matter how much we surround it with rights and respect it has no personal being it is part of the earth man walks on it is not man its the game of life do i win or do i lose one day theyre gonna shut the game down i gotta have as much fun and go around the board as many times as i can before its my turn to leave love is life and if you miss love you miss life the best thing to hold onto in life is each other there is nothing more tragic than to find an individual bogged down in the length of life devoid of breadth the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time we make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give the only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows today more than ever before life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility not only nation to nation and human to human but also human to other forms of life without health life is not life it is only a state of langour and suffering  an image of death he who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life when i was young i thought that money was the most important thing in life now that i am old i know that it is beginning today treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight extend to them all the care kindness and understanding you can muster and do it with no thought of any reward your life will never be the same again the more you praise and celebrate your life the more there is in life to celebrate in dwelling live close to the ground in thinking keep to the simple in conflict be fair and generous in governing dont try to control in work do what you enjoy in family life be completely present if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with success unexpected in common hours learning to trust is one of lifes most difficult tasks achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life and that happiness not pain or mindless selfindulgence is the proof of your moral integrity since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values the things that will destroy america are prosperityatanyprice peaceatanyprice safetyfirst instead of dutyfirst the love of soft living and the getrichquick theory of life trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement dont make assumptions find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings sadness and drama with just this one agreement you can completely transform your life life is tough but its tougher when youre stupid a man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life lifes tragedy is that we get old to soon and wise too late focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something  your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life all the adversity ive had in my life all my troubles and obstacles have strengthened me you may not realize it when it happens but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you all my life i have tried to pluck a thistle and plant a flower wherever the flower would grow in thought and mind we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light an armed society is a polite society manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life i love sleep my life has the tendency to fall apart when im awake you know the best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own you do not blame them on your mother the ecology or the president you realize that you control your own destiny tomorrow is the most important thing in life comes into us at midnight very clean its perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands it hopes weve learned something from yesterday remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything  all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure  these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life so long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart i shall say that life is good today i choose life every morning when i wake up i can choose joy happiness negativity pain to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices  today i choose to feel life not to deny my humanity but embrace it to succeed in life you need two things ignorance and confidence you can have everything in life you want if you will just help other people get what they want life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit my life has been one great big joke a dance thats walked a song thats spoke i laugh so hard i almost choke when i think about myself your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it there is only one thing in life worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about through humor you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers and once you find laughter no matter how painful your situation might be you can survive it the secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you if you do that youre in control of your life if you dont life controls you all my life my heart has yearned for a thing i cannot name if the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you it will be enough there are only two tragedies in life one is not getting what one wants and the other is getting it the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves what a wee little part of a persons life are his acts and his words his real life is led in his head and is known to none but himself those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them for these only gave them life those the art of living well life is full of beauty notice it notice the bumble bee the small child and the smiling faces smell the rain and feel the wind live your life to the fullest potential and fight for your dreams the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts therefore guard accordingly and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature in our daily life we encounter people who are angry deceitful intent only on satisfying their own needs there is so much anger distrust greed and pettiness that we are losing our capacity to work well together to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love god better because of them make it a habit to tell people thank you to express your appreciation sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return truly appreciate those around you and youll soon find many others around you truly appreciate life and youll find that you have more of it each person must live their life as a model for others i believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life you cant truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles true wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life ourselves and the world around us there are four questions of value in life what is sacred of what is the spirit made what is worth living for and what is worth dying for the answer to each is the same only love money isnt the most important thing in life but its reasonably close to oxygen on the gotta have it scale im the one that has to die when its time for me to die so let me live my life the way i want to i decided very early on just to accept life unconditionally i never expected it to do anything special for me yet i seemed to accomplish far more than i had ever hoped most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it life is a gamble you can get hurt but people die in plane crashes lose their arms and legs in car accidents people die every day same with fighters some die some get hurt some go on you just dont let yourself believe it will happen to you i dont believe in guilt i believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person and dont judge people in your life i think you should live completely free you change your life by changing your heart probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age when the eager passions of youth are cooled and the infirmities of age not yet begun as we see that the shadows which are at morning and evening so large almost entirely disappear at midday i never thought of losing but now that it s happened the only thing is to do it right thats my obligation to all the people who believe in me we all have to take defeats in life life stands before me like an eternal spring with new and brilliant clothes life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself true friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils strive to have friends for life without friends is like life on a desert island to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune to keep him is a blessing the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only object of good government the key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering my rule of life prescribed as an absolutely sacred rite smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before after and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them even when a person has all of lifes comforts  good food good shelter a companion  he or she can still become unhappy when encountering a tragic situation march on do not tarry to go forward is to move toward perfection march on and fear not the thorns or the sharp stones on lifes path you can never really live anyone elses life not even your childs the influence you exert is through your own life and what youve become yourself the purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls the important thing is that men should have a purpose in life it should be something useful something good as you walk down the fairway of life you must smell the roses for you only get to play one round every mans life ends the same way it is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another if you ask me what i came into this life to do i will tell you i came to live out loud part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside theres no tragedy in life like the death of a child things never get back to the way they were some of the worst mistakes of my life have been haircuts before success comes in any mans life hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and perhaps some failures when defeat overtakes a man the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit thats exactly what the majority of men do you can change your world by changing your words remember death and life are in the power of the tongue have the courage to say no have the courage to face the truth do the right thing because it is right these are the magic keys to living your life with integrity life is as tedious as twicetold tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man a sense of humor is needed armor joy in ones heart and some laughter on ones lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing there is no end to education it is not that you read a book pass an examination and finish with education the whole of life from the moment you are born to the moment you die is a process of learning nothing is perfect life is messy relationships are complex outcomes are uncertain people are irrational a nation which has forgotten the quality of courage which in the past has been brought to public life is not as likely to insist upon or regard that quality in its chosen leaders today  and in fact we have forgotten life is not easy for any of us but what of that we must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves we must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained there is no passion to be found playing small  in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living literature adds to reality it does not simply describe it it enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides and in this respect it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become if you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life in the course of my life i have often had to eat my words and i must confess that i have always found it a wholesome diet once i knew only darkness and stillness my life was without past or future but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness and my heart leaped to the rapture of living i am convinced that material things can contribute a lot to making ones life pleasant but basically if you do not have very good friends and relatives who matter to you life will be really empty and sad and material things cease to be important nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result football is like life  it requires perseverance selfdenial hard work sacrifice dedication and respect for authority for time and the world do not stand still change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future life is either a great adventure or nothing stop acting as if life is a rehearsal live this day as if it were your last the past is over and gone the future is not guaranteed once in his life every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead time is the coin of your life it is the only coin you have and only you can determine how it will be spent be careful lest you let other people spend it for you in war as in life it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed to take up the best alternative open and if so it is folly not to work for it with all your might books constitute capital a library book lasts as long as a house for hundreds of years it is not then an article of mere consumption but fairly of capital and often in the case of professional men setting out in life it is their only capital the christian life is not a constant high i have my moments of deep discouragement i have to go to god in prayer with tears in my eyes and say o god forgive me or help me the ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival i guess i have always been deeply terrified to really be someones wife since i know from life one cannot love another ever really life is never fair and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not people grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously this is how character is built without pain there would be no suffering without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes to make it right pain and suffering is the key to all windows without it there is no way of life if you are not too long i will wait here for you all my life constant development is the law of life and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position life is hard its harder if youre stupid let everyone try and find that as a result of daily prayer he adds something new to his life something with which nothing can be compared no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it is lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new it takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure to embrace the new but there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful there is more security in the adventurous and exciting for in movement there is life and in change there is power truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness holding on to anger resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life life is a process of becoming a combination of states we have to go through where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it this is a kind of death life is a series of experiences each one of which makes us bigger even though sometimes it is hard to realize this for the world was built to develop character and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward there is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it life is one grand sweet song so start the music when we do the best that we can we never know what miracle is wrought in our life or in the life of another at fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender in its place was as honorable as resistance especially if one had no choice one of the things i learned the hard way was that it doesnt pay to get discouraged keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself as you simplify your life the laws of the universe will be simpler solitude will not be solitude poverty will not be poverty nor weakness weakness life loves to be taken by the lapel and told im with you kid lets go there are only three things women need in life food water and compliments life is an exciting business and most exciting when it is lived for others im not claiming divinity ive never claimed purity of soul ive never claimed to have the answers to life i only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as i can but i still believe in peace love and understanding a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things there will be sleeping enough in the grave each player must accept the cards life deals him or her but once they are in hand he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game we have one life it soon will be past what we do for god is all that will last life is hard after all it kills you my philosophy of life is that if we make up our mind what we are going to make of our lives then work hard toward that goal we never lose  somehow we win out my favorite things in life dont cost any money its really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time a chief event of life is the day in which we have encountered a mind that startled us to deprive a man of his natural liberty and to deny to him the ordinary amenities of life is worse then starving the body it is starvation of the soul the dweller in the body it was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped my family frankly they werent folks who went to church every week my mother was one of the most spiritual people i knew but she didnt raise me in the church so i came to my christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of jesus christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that i would want to lead learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself and know that everything in life has purpose there are no mistakes no coincidences all events are blessings given to us to learn from one reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus we never concentrate our power most people dabble their way through life never deciding to master anything in particular the main purpose of life is to live rightly think rightly act rightly the soul must languish when we give all our thought to the body at the end of your life you will never regret not having passed one more test not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal you will regret time not spent with a husband a friend a child or a parent life imitates art far more than art imitates life say theres a white kid who lives in a nice home goes to an allwhite school and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter  for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me because what thats saying is that hes living a fantasy life of rebellion i have spent many years of my life in opposition and i rather like the role freedom is never dear at any price it is the breath of life what would a man not pay for living life every man holds dear but the dear man holds honor far more precious dear than life alcohol is the anesthesia by which we endure the operation of life we have the duty to protect the life of an unborn child the greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intendedand not to take a hint when a hint isnt intended you will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love religion is more than life remember that his own religion is the truest to every man even if it stands low in the scales of philosophical comparison very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking the great danger for family life in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure comfort and independence lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish there is more to life than increasing its speed fathers should be neither seen nor heard that is the only proper basis for family life the world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happily married life i put all my genius into my life i put only my talent into my works there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain one should sympathise with the colour the beauty the joy of life the less said about lifes sores the better i know in my heart that man is good that what is right will always eventually triumph and theres purpose and worth to each and every life purity of personal life is the one indispensable condition for building up a sound education but what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads the man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life the one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties you do things when the opportunities come along ive had periods in my life when ive had a bundle of ideas come along and ive had long dry spells if i get an idea next week ill do something if not i wont do a damn thing presents dont really mean much to me i dont want to sound mawkish but  it was the realization that i have a great many people in my life who really love me and who i really love im so glad i never feel important it does complicate life ones real life is so often the life that one does not lead education is not preparation for life education is life itself life must be lived and curiosity kept alive one must never for whatever reason turn his back on life i bear a charmed life man does not control his own fate the women in his life do that for him i havent trusted polls since i read that 62 of women had affairs during their lunch hour ive never met a woman in my life who would give up lunch for sex in married life three is company and two none life is pretty simple you do some stuff most fails some works you do more of what works if it works big others quickly copy it then you do something else the trick is the doing something else throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country a man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life autobiographies are only useful as the lives you read about and analyze may suggest to you something that you may find useful in your own journey through life in modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude it makes the whole world kin the greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes thats the day we truly grow up for life and death are one even as the river and the sea are one it is one of the beautiful compensations in this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself in poverty and other misfortunes of life true friends are a sure refuge the young they keep out of mischief to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds i am a woman in process im just trying like everybody else i try to take every conflict every experience and learn from it life is never dull when you have nobody you can make a cup of tea for when nobody needs you thats when i think life is over if you are lucky enough to have lived in paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you for paris is a moveable feast dost thou love life then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of your daily life is your temple and your religion when you enter into it take with you your all you have to take risks we will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen frazier is so ugly that he should donate his face to the us bureau of wild life if anyone is crazy enough to want to kill a president of the united states he can do it all he must be prepared to do is give his life for the presidents he who is not everyday conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life the greatest gift of life is friendship and i have received it life is without meaning you bring the meaning to it the meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be being alive is the meaning the world is very different now for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life life is hard then you die then they throw dirt in your face then the worms eat you be grateful it happens in that order opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging i am sorry to say that there is too much point to the wisecrack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins there is always inequality in life some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country life is unfair i really havent had that exciting of a life there are a lot of things i wish i would have done instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life so i pretty much like to make it up id rather tell a story about somebody else choose your lifes mate carefully from this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up success comes from taking the initiative and following up persisting eloquently expressing the depth of your love what simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life i want to live my life so that my nights are not full of regrets dont be too timid and squeamish about your actions all life is an experiment this is the strangest life ive ever known the wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently but he is willing in great crises to give even his life  knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine your life is the fruit of your own doing you have no one to blame but yourself is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death life is thickly sown with thorns and i know no other remedy than to pass quickly through them the longer we dwell on our misfortunes the greater is their power to harm us i have learned that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours when his life was ruined his family killed his farm destroyed job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens why god why me and the thundering voice of god answered theres just something about you that pisses me off all the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination imagination is the workshop of your mind capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth the quality of a persons life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence regardless of their chosen field of endeavor are you bored with life then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart live for it die for it and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours old age is just a record of ones whole life the more sand has escaped from the hourglass of our life the clearer we should see through it death and life have their determined appointments riches and honors depend upon heaven a man is a god in ruins when men are innocent life shall be longer and shall pass into the immortal as gently as we awake from dreams to be able to look back upon ones life in satisfaction is to live twice an atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church an atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said an atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death he wants disease conquered poverty vanished war eliminated you want to believe that theres one relationship in life thats beyond betrayal a relationship thats beyond that kind of hurt and there isnt i need drama in my life to keep making music i should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end requesting only the advantage authors have of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first one thing they never tell you about child raising is that for the rest of your life at the drop of a hat you are expected to know your childs name and how old he or she is there are two primary choices in life to accept conditions as they exist or accept the responsibility for changing them the ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace making the best of circumstances friendship is the shadow of the evening which increases with the setting sun of life to lengthen thy life lessen thy meals three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for life without liberty is like a body without spirit you may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the worlds problems at once but dont ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for the small ones and when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task go to sleep in peace the secret of life is honesty and fair dealing if you can fake that youve got it made be true to the game because the game will be true to you if you try to shortcut the game then the game will shortcut you if you put forth the effort good things will be bestowed upon you thats truly about the game and in some ways thats about life too life and death are one thread the same line viewed from different sides if we dont know life how can we know death do not be too moral you may cheat yourself out of much life so aim above morality be not simply good be good for something he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act the object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane the energy of the mind is the essence of life i challenge you to make your life a masterpiece i challenge you to join the ranks of those people who live what they teach who walk their talk the expectations of life depend upon diligence the mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools life is a gift and it offers us the privilege opportunity and responsibility to give something back by becoming more life is the art of drawing without an eraser politicians also have no leisure because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself power and glory or happiness children are the anchors of a mothers life freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose anything less is a form of slavery a life is either all spiritual or not spiritual at all no man can serve two masters your life is shaped by the end you live for you are made in the image of what you desire is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves as soon as there is life there is danger it is best to rise from life as from a banquet neither thirsty nor drunken babies dont need a vacation but i still see them at the beach it pisses me off ill go over to a little baby and say what are you doing here you havent worked a day in your life life is not fair get used to it the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom it is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life where you stumble there lies your treasure one secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes people disparage knowing and the intellectual life and urge doing i am content with knowing if only i could know waste your money and youre only out of money but waste your time and youve lost a part of your life if theres not drama and negativity in my life all my songs will be really wack and boring or something art is the proper task of life different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government the unexamined life is not worth living sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick dont lose faith each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death i cant really change my life to accommodate people who are jealous i dont see why i should there is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself as we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed i know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor men create gods after their own image not only with regard to their form but with regard to their mode of life the true object of all human life is play earth is a task garden heaven is a playground our truest life is when we are in dreams awake life began with waking up and loving my mothers face i want to wake up every day and do whatever comes in my mind and not feel pressure or obligations to do anything else in my life a womans life can really be a succession of lives each revolving around some emotionally compelling situation or challenge and each marked off by some intense experience a broad margin of leisure is as beautiful in a mans life as in a book haste makes waste no less in life than in housekeeping keep the time observe the hours of the universe not of the cars i think computer viruses should count as life i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive weve created life in our own image thou wilt find rest from vain fancies if thou doest every act in life as though it were thy last id like to be settled into somewhat of a normal life somewhat i know its never going to be completely normal ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness so on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another only a look and a voice then darkness again and a silence the most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity the fears are paper tigers you can do anything you decide to do you can act to change and control your life and the procedure  the process is its own reward loneliness is my least favorite thing about life the thing that im most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me in college i never realized the opportunities available to a pro athlete ive been given the chance to meet all kinds of people to travel and expand my financial capabilities to get ideas and learn about life to create a world apart from basketball life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage the state comes into existence for the sake of life and continues to exist for the sake of good life life is truly known only to those who suffer lose endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat there are two tragedies in life one is to lose your hearts desire the other is to gain it dreams are necessary to life there are old heads in the world who cannot help me by their example or advice to live worthily and satisfactorily to myself but i believe that it is in my power to elevate myself this very hour above the common level of my life i have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed its true christmas can feel like a lot of work particularly for mothers but when you look back on all the christmases in your life youll find youve created family traditions and lasting memories those memories good and bad are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul a man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food therefore if he eats meat he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite we can always choose to perceive things differently you can focus on whats wrong in your life or you can focus on whats right to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already three parts dead you must understand the whole of life not just one little part of it that is why you must read that is why you must look at the skies that is why you must sing and dance and write poems and suffer and understand for all that is life when i chased after money i never had enough when i got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life then i was prosperous our life is frittered away by detail simplify simplify sometimes i feel my whole life has been one big rejection respect is one of lifes greatest treasures i mean what does it all add up to if you dont have that if you spend your life competing with business men what do you have a bank account and ulcers if there is only one thing in my life that i am proud of its that ive never been a kept woman sometimes i think it would be easier to avoid old age to die young but then youd never complete your life would you youd never wholly know you thug life to me is dead there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats a hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself i have so much chaos in my life its become normal you become used to it you have to just relax calm down take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how theyre wrong for me life is continuously being hungry the meaning of life is not simply to exist to survive but to move ahead to go up to achieve to conquer always fall in with what youre asked to accept take what is given and make it over your way my aim in life has always been to hold my own with whatevers going not against with i dont have expectations expectations in your life just lead to giant disappointments judgments value judgments concerning life for or against can in the last resort never be true they possess value only as symptoms they come into consideration only as symptoms  in themselves such judgments are stupidities if youre married and you have a wife and you really love your wife is it good enough to only say to your wife i love her the day you get married or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity and thats how i feel about my relationship with jesus christ is that it is the most important thing in my life let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life the living being is only a species of the dead and a very rare species life is divided into three terms  that which was which is and which will be let us learn from the past to profit by the present and from the present to live better in the future there are people who want to make mens lives more difficult for no other reason than the chance it provides them afterwards to offer their prescription for alleviating life their christianity for instance my definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain  and because of your lifestyle have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain this is as true in everyday life as it is in battle we are given one life and the decision is ours whether to wait for circumstances to make up our mind or whether to act and in acting to live most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil that sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life  all areas of life the really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity a dream is your creative vision for your life in the future you must break out of your current comfort zone and become comfortable with the unfamiliar and the unknown the lie is a condition of life the goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe to match your nature with nature if you plan on being anything less than you are capable of being you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life dont ignore the past but deal with it on your own pace once you deal with it you are free of it and you are free to embrace your life and be a happy loving person because if you dont the past will come back to haunt and keep coming back to haunt you what is called genius is the abundance of life and health little men with little minds and little imaginations go through life in little ruts smugly resisting all changes which would jar their little worlds regarding life the wisest men of all ages have judged alike it is worthless being in control of your life and having realistic expectations about your daytoday challenges are the keys to stress management which is perhaps the most important ingredient to living a happy healthy and rewarding life acceptance of ones life has nothing to do with resignation it does not mean running away from the struggle on the contrary it means accepting it as it comes with all the handicaps of heredity of suffering of psychological complexes and injustices bottom line is i didnt return to apple to make a fortune ive been very lucky in my life and already have one when i was 25 my net worth was 100 million or so i decided then that i wasnt going to let it ruin my life theres no way you could ever spend it all and i dont view wealth as something that validates my intelligence the greatest mistake you can make in life is continually fearing that youll make one a return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man his good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example the life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living i just dont know how to deal with so many people giving me that much affection i never had that in my life the key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life  mental emotional spiritual as well as physical about all you can do in life is be who you are some people will love you for you most will love you for what you can do for them and some wont like you at all wealth is the ability to fully experience life every day is a new opportunity you can build on yesterdays success or put its failures behind and start over again thats the way life is with a new game every day and thats the way baseball is if you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant personal liberty is the purpose of government to protect liberty  not to run your personal life not to run the economy and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live what each must seek in his life never was on land or sea it is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else faith is a living daring confidence in gods grace so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times you cannot tailormake the situations in life but you can tailormake the attitudes to fit those situations the only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first loneliness adds beauty to life it puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better ive reached a point in my life where its the little things that matter i was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had i changed my attitude but when you think about it i got pretty far without changing attitudes im happier with that dad almost died of a heart attack in the middle of making apocalypse now the biggest movie of his life it doesnt make you want to jump into that business im not one of those complicated mixedup cats im not looking for the secret to life i just go on from day to day taking what comes education doesnt change life much it just lifts trouble to a higher plane of regard only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience lifes deepest joy true fulfillment apply yourself both now and in the next life without effort you cannot be prosperous though the land be good you cannot have an abundant crop without cultivation false friendship like the ivy decays and ruins the walls it embraces but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports develop an interest in life as you see it the people things literature music  the world is so rich simply throbbing with rich treasures beautiful souls and interesting people forget yourself i always like to look on the optimistic side of life but i am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment therein he cannot be replaced nor can his life be repeated thus everyones task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it never separate the life you live from the words you speak it is not doing the thing we like to do but liking the thing we have to do that makes life blessed using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get but if you work really hard and youre kind amazing things will happen if i knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for my life i have a great respect for incremental improvement and ive done that sort of thing in my life but ive always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes i dont know why because theyre harder theyre much more stressful emotionally and you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that youve completely failed i would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life a man who had good friends fine family  and i dont think i could ask for anything more than that actually most of the change we think we see in life is due to truths being in and out of favor being yourself is one of the hardest things because its scary you always wonder whether youll be accepted for who you really are i decided to call my record inside out because thats my motto about life i dont think you ever succeed at trying to be anyone else but who you truly are there is no more fatal blunderer than he who consumes the greater part of his life getting his living nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions who shall say what prospect life offers to another when i am able to resist the temptation to judge others i can see them as teachers of forgiveness in my life reminding me that i can only have peace of mind when i forgive rather than judge im back to doing everything i used to loving life as ever you leave old habits behind by starting out with the thought i release the need for this in my life the way you think the way you behave the way you eat can influence your life by 30 to 50 years the quality of life is more important than life itself i didnt see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life i think its important to have closure in any relationship that ends  from a romantic relationship to a friendship you should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended you need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase where is the life we have lost in living where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge where is the knowledge we have lost in information im most proud of the blessings that god has bestowed upon me in my life hes given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down but you can still get back up hopefully ill learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing i do two such as you with such a master speed cannot be parted nor be swept away from one another once you are agreed that life is only life forevermore together wing to wing and oar to oar be happy for this moment this moment is your life you have the right to kill me but you dont have the right to judge me thats life theres nobility in that theres focus its genuine its crystal and its pure and its available to everybody so just shut your traps and put down your mcdonalds your vaccines your us weekly your tmz and the rest of it i would say my greatest achievement in life right now  my greatest achievement period is  and im still trying to achieve it  is to be a wonderful father to my kids infuse your life with action dont wait for it to happen make it happen make your own future make your own hope make your own love and whatever your beliefs honor your creator not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high but by doing what you can to make grace happen yourself right now right down here on earth life begins at the end of your comfort zone people are taken aback by a confident pretty girl who knows what she wants in life and isnt going to let anyone get in her way and you know what its all about jealousy what i learned in jail is that i cant change i cant live a different lifestylethis is it this is the life that they gave and this is the life that i made let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others once youve wrestled everything else in life is easy the chief reason for going to school is to get the impression fixed for life that there is a book side for everything death is not an event in life we do not live to experience death if we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present when you are tough on yourself life is going to be infinitely easier on you take care to sell your horse before he dies the art of life is passing losses on the biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams if you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account its funny how most people love the dead once youre dead your made for life mans real life is happy chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so its better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life winning is great sure but if you are really going to do something in life the secret is learning how to lose nobody goes undefeated all the time if you can pick up after a crushing defeat and go on to win again you are going to be a champion someday live your life do your work then take your hat and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond that you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them live the life youve dreamed if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life i think that there is nothing not even crime more opposed to poetry to philosophy ay to life itself than this incessant business choose your friends with caution plan your future with purpose and frame your life with faith there is always a present and extant life be it better or worse which all combine to uphold a man cannot be said to succeed in this life who does not satisfy one friend accept responsibility for your life know that it is you who will get you where you want to go no one else unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives mans life is independent he is born not for the development of the society alone but for the development of his self poetry is a way of taking life by the throat the great advantage of a hotel is that it is a refuge from home life life contains but two tragedies one is not to get your hearts desire the other is to get it one life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it but to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief that is a fate more terrible than dying the major value in life is not what you get the major value in life is what you become its a funny thing about life if you refuse to accept anything but the best you very often get it life is the flower for which love is the honey my advice to people today is as follows if you take the game of life seriously if you take your nervous system seriously if you take your sense organs seriously if you take the energy process seriously you must turn on tune in and drop out miracles in the sense of phenomena we cannot explain surround us on every hand life itself is the miracle of miracles keep your eyes open to your mercies the man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life if i had to live my life again id make the same mistakes only sooner the end of life is to be like god and the soul following god will be like him lifes like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending the struggle of my life created empathy  i could relate to pain being abandoned having people not love me while we have the gift of life it seems to me the only tragedy is to allow part of us to die  whether it is our spirit our creativity or our glorious uniqueness i want to be thoroughly used up when i die for the harder i work the more i live i rejoice in life for its own sake becoming a father i think it inevitably changes your perspective of life i dont get nearly enough sleep and the simplest things in life are completely satisfying i find you dont have to do as much like you dont go on as many outings god is to be worshipped as the one beloved dearer than everything in this and next life three passions simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life the longing for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind the figure a poem makes it begins in delight and ends in wisdom in a clarification of life  not necessarily a great clarification such as sects and cults are founded on but in a momentary stay against confusion one of the secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death all my life affection has been showered upon me and every forward step i have made has been taken in spite of it theres only two people in your life you should lie to the police and your girlfriend one way or another we all have to find what best fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life and dedicate ourselves to that the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us life is to be lived if you have to support yourself you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting and you dont do that by sitting around no man is worth his salt who is not ready at all times to risk his wellbeing to risk his body to risk his life in a great cause i am an example of what is possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by people around them i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life who taught me about quiet strength and dignity never permit a dichotomy to rule your life a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time above our life we love a steadfast friend children make your life important life is not what its supposed to be its what it is the way you cope with it is what makes the difference one of the sanest surest and most generous joys of life comes from being happy over the good fortune of others god had brought me to my knees and made me acknowledge my own nothingness and out of that knowledge i had been reborn i was no longer the centre of my life and therefore i could see god in everything do every act of your life as if it were your last my mother wanted us to understand that the tragedies of your life one day have the potential to be comic stories the next home life is no more natural to us than a cage is natural to a cockatoo music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us oh be swift to love make haste to be kind when you step on the brakes your life is in your foots hands life levels all men death reveals the eminent i am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the american way of life is freedom limited government and minding our own business overseas you are a product of your environment so choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective analyze your life in terms of its environment are the things around you helping you toward success  or are they holding you back im not an example for how people should live their lives never in my life would i ever set out to be an example for people on how to live their lives if you need an example for how to live then you just shouldnt have been born straight up without work all life goes rotten but when work is soulless life stifles and dies i worked hard all my life as far as this music business i dreamed of the day when i could go to new york and feel comfortable and they could come out here and be comfortable maybe you dont like your job maybe you didnt get enough sleep well nobody likes their job nobody got enough sleep maybe you just had the worst day of your life but you know theres no escape theres no excuse so just suck up and be nice never try to impress a woman because if you do shell expect you to keep up the standard for the rest of your life never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering too often in life something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled so the point is we all have choices and we make the choice to accept people or situations or to not accept situations the life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end nor protects it from the bites of insects i think what makes our marriage work amid all the glare is that my husband is my best friend he inspires everything in my life and enables me to do the best that i can i want to hang out with him more than anyone life would be tolerable but for its amusements dreams do come true if we only wish hard enough you can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it you are going to let the fear of poverty govern you life and your reward will be that you will eat but you will not live i believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear i really dont think life is about the icouldhavebeens life is only about the itriedtodo i dont mind the failure but i cant imagine that id forgive myself if i didnt try we continue to shape our personality all our life if we knew ourselves perfectly we should die it is better to create than to learn creating is the essence of life what if you gave someone a gift and they neglected to thank you for it  would you be likely to give them another life is the same way in order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer you must truly appreciate what you already have there is a vitality a life force an energy a quickening that is translated through you into action and because there is only one of you in all time this expression is unique these technologies can make life easier can let us touch people we might not otherwise you may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups get medical information the latest experimental drugs these things can profoundly influence life im not downplaying that life is very interesting in the end some of your greatest pains become your greatest strengths today is lifethe only life you are sure of make the most of today get interested in something shake yourself awake develop a hobby let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you live today with gusto every year of my life i grow more convinced that it is wisest and best to fix our attention on the beautiful and the good and dwell as little as possible on the evil and the false this is love to fly toward a secret sky to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment first to let go of life finally to take a step without feet maxim for life you get treated in life the way you teach people to treat you every man is the architect of his own life he builds it just the way he wants it however after he has built what he wants he sometimes decides that he doesnt like what he has built and looks for someone or something to blame instead of changing himself whatever you do in life surround yourself with smart people wholl argue with you every human is an artist the dream of your life is to make beautiful art character in the long run is the decisive factor in the life of an individual and of nations alike blood relatives often have nothing to do with family and similarly family is about who you choose to make your life with i believe this with all my heart the greatest coach of all time in my eyes is my mom shes instilled in me a toughness and a perseverance and just a neverquit mentality and i thank her every day for providing me for what she sacrificed her life for how do you go from where you are to where you wanna be and i think you have to have an enthusiasm for life you have to have a dream a goal and you have to be willing to work for it the real test of friendship is can you literally do nothing with the other person can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple the most glorious moments in your life are not the socalled days of success but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life and the promise of future accomplishments you come to a point in your life when you really dont care what people think about you you just care what you think about yourself a welldeveloped sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life ive been absolutely terrified every moment of my life  and ive never let it keep me from doing a single thing i wanted to do do the best you can and dont take life too serious we only live once but once is enough if we do it right live your life with class dignity and style so that an exclamation rather than a question mark signifies it life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves i actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when youre trying to make money and then go to another meeting where youre giving it away i mean is it gonna erode your ability you know to make money are you gonna somehow get confused about what youre trying to do attention to health is lifes greatest hindrance friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil school is practice for future life practice makes perfect and nobodys perfect so why practice at times in my life the only place i have been happy is when i am on stage what you get is a living what you give is a life be patient and understanding life is too short to be vengeful or malicious i havent lived a perfect life i have regrets but thats from a lifetime of taking chances making decisions and trying not to be frozen the only thing that i can do with my regrets is understand them the value of life lies not in the length of days but in the use we make of them whether you find satisfaction in life depends not on your tale of years but on your will my trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life is what keeps me moving forward it takes half your life before you discover life is a doityourself project he who binds to himself a joy does the winged life destroy but he who kisses the joy as it flies lives in eternitys sun rise let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children communication is a skill that you can learn its like riding a bicycle or typing if youre willing to work at it you can rapidly improve the quality of evry part of your life life lived for tomorrow will always be just a day away from being realized i never did a days work in my life it was all fun let love flow so that it cleanses the world then man can live in peace instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life with all those material interests and earthly ambitions sometimes its the smallest decisions that can change your life forever there is a fountain of youth it is your mind your talents the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love when you learn to tap this source you will truly have defeated age life is just one damned thing after another thats the way i got along in life i dont ever remember being particularly jealous of anybody because i figured if i cant do it myself i dont deserve to get it love we say is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death the happiness of this life depends less on what befalls you than the way in which you take it it is possible to become discouraged about the injustice we see everywhere but god did not promise us that the world would be humane and just he gives us the gift of life and allows us to choose the way we will use our limited time on earth it is an awesome opportunity and by the way everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it and the imagination to improvise the worst enemy to creativity is selfdoubt man is subject to innumerable pains and sorrows by the very condition of humanity and yet as if nature had not sown evils enough in life we are continually adding grief to grief and aggravating the common calamity by our cruel treatment of one another television is not real life in real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs to expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness we have to be able to grow up our wrinkles are our medals of the passage of life they are what we have been through and who we want to be polygamy an endeavour to get more out of life than there is in it what material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter and that is being able to make a difference not only in your own life but in other peoples lives my alma mater was books a good library i could spend the rest of my life reading just satisfying my curiosity live by this credo have a little laugh at life and look around you for happiness instead of sadness laughter has always brought me out of unhappy situations its not the men in my life that count its the life in my men life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next what theyre not ready for is guys like you and i and nails and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life that we are high priests vatican assassin warlocks boom print that people see where that goes i blame my mother for my poor sex life all she told me was the man goes on top and the woman underneath for three years my husband and i slept in bunk beds imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life sleep  the most beautiful experience in life  except drink art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life be strong believe in freedom and in god love yourself understand your sexuality have a sense of humor masturbate dont judge people by their religion color or sexual habits love life and your family for if there is a sin against life it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life as a remedy to life in society i would suggest the big city nowadays it is the only desert within our means it is normal to give away a little of ones life in order not to lose it all ive always taken the wizard of oz very seriously you know i believe in the idea of the rainbow and ive spent my entire life trying to get over it the highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about nor read about nor seen but if one will are to be lived there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like a pebble drops some careless word it overflows and its secret spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together its funny the way most people love the dead once you are dead you are made for life life takes its path and sometimes there are people to blame of course there are bad people in this world good bad it happens unfortunately but in a way i think if there was more focus on the good more good would happen life all comes down to a few moments this is one of them the joy of life consists in the exercise of ones energies continual growth constant change the enjoyment of every new experience to stop means simply to die the eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal ones family is the most important thing in life i look at it this way one of these days ill be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me and the only people wholl be with me will be my family the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life i like people that enjoy life cause i do the same for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life so if you stay ready you aint gotta get ready and that is how i run my life life is too short to spend hoping that the perfectly arched eyebrow or hottest new lip shade will mask an ugly heart we dont get a chance to do that many things and every one should be really excellent because this is our life life is brief and then you die you know so this is what weve chosen to do with our life if i had to choose a religion the sun as the universal giver of life would be my god life is made up not of great sacrifices or duties but of little things in which smiles and kindness and small obligations given habitually are what preserve the heart and secure comfort there has never yet been a man in our history who led a life of ease whose name is worth remembering i just got one last thing i urge all of you all of you to enjoy your life the precious moments you have to spend each day with some laughter and some thought to get youre emotions going do what you love to do and give it your very best whether its business or baseball or the theater or any field if you dont love what youre doing and you cant give it your best get out of it life is too short youll be an old man before you know it i dont think you ever stop giving i really dont i think its an ongoing process and its not just about being able to write a check its being able to touch somebodys life faith is the first factor in a life devoted to service without it nothing is possible with it nothing is impossible my goal is to be one with the music i just dedicate my whole life to this art a life lived with integrity  even if it lacks the trappings of fame and fortune is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come if a man can bridge the gap between life and death if he can live on after hes dead then maybe he was a great man i like the idea of being alone i like the idea of often being alone in all aspects of my life i like to feel lonely i like to need things life is what we make it always has been always will be for the meaning of life differs from man to man from day to day and from hour to hour what matters therefore is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others by means of love friendship indignation and compassion im at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life in fact ive just had a mirror put over my kitchen table if i have any worth it is to live my life for god so as to teach these peoples even though some of them still look down on me life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone i really believe that everyone has a talent ability or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life i lost my sense of trust honesty and compassion i crashed down and became what i consider an emotional mess ive never been so miserable in my whole life i just wanted to go to bed and never get up i have found it easier to identify with the characters who verge upon hysteria who were frightened of life who were desperate to reach out to another person but these seemingly fragile people are the strong people really life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives i have been up against tough competition all my life i wouldnt know how to get along without it life is all memory except for the one present moment that goes by you so quickly you hardly catch it going i have a lot of things to prove to myself one is that i can live my life fearlessly you make mistakes but i dont have any regrets im the kind of person who takes responsibility for it and deals with it i learn from everything i do i work very hard i have so many things going on in my life get to know me and see who i am photography takes an instant out of time altering life by holding it still lifes pretty good and why wouldnt it be im a pirate after all sorrow is knowledge those that know the most must mourn the deepest the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are doing creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea creativity gives the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone creativity makes life more fun and more interesting gratitude helps you to grow and expand gratitude brings joy and laughter into your life and into the lives of all those around you if i were to say god why me about the bad things then i should have said god why me about the good things that happened in my life music is love love is music music is life and i love my life thank you and good night i was set free because my greatest fear had been realized and i still had a daughter who i adored and i had an old typewriter and a big idea and so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life i dont think ive ever worked so hard on something but working on macintosh was the neatest experience of my life almost everyone who worked on it will say that none of us wanted to release it at the end it was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands it wouldnt be ours anymore words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life the longer i live the more convinced i become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it ill always stay connected with apple i hope that throughout my life ill sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of apple weave in and out of each other like a tapestry there may be a few years when im not there but ill always come back friends are as companions on a journey who ought to aid each other to persevere in the road to a happier life the first thing which i can record concerning myself is that i was born these are wonderful words this life to which neither time nor eternity can bring diminution  this everlasting living soul began my mind loses itself in these depths take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life when it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude he who is void of virtuous attachments in private life is or very soon will be void of all regard for his country there is seldom an instance of a man guilty of betraying his country who had not before lost the feeling of moral obligations in his private connections sometimes i feel like one who is on the sidelines who has missed life itself hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is a brokenwinged bird that cannot fly life is to be entered upon with courage difficult times have helped me to understand better than before how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever haters never win i just think thats true about life because negative energy always costs in the end in life you need either inspiration or desperation they tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person your problem is how you are going to spend this one odd and precious life you have been issued whether youre going to spend it trying to look good and creating the illusion that you have power over people and circumstances or whether you are going to taste it enjoy it and find out the truth about who you are you cant make positive choices for the rest of your life without an environment that makes those choices easy natural and enjoyable woz is living his own life now he hasnt been around apple for about five years but what he did will go down in history half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have rushed through life trying to save choice of attention  to pay attention to this and ignore that  is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer in both cases a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences whatever they may be it is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all ones life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than try to be a little kinder i think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life sometimes you trust someone who turns out not to be honest there are a lot of things that happen in life that dont turn out the way youre given the impression that they will and i think thats all kind of a con but i think weve probably all been hurt my guiding principles in life are to be honest genuine thoughtful and caring be thou the rainbow in the storms of life the evening beam that smiles the clouds away and tints tomorrow with prophetic ray i do not believe in excuses i believe in hard work as the prime solvent of lifes problems i made a mistake by being ejected from the presidency next time i will choose a cabinet which will allow me to be life president life is too short to worry about anything you had better enjoy it because the next day promises nothing the personal life deeply lived always expands into truths beyond itself you must pass your days in song let your whole life be a song a bachelors life is a fine breakfast a flat lunch and a miserable dinner if you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life with confidence you have won even before you have started you know what your problem is its that you havent seen enough movies  all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies life is 10 what happens to you and 90 how you react to it you were made by god and for god and until you understand that life will never make sense life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle my general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day i never do anything with a feeling of oh god ive got to do this today when you do the common things in life in an uncommon way you will command the attention of the world without knowing what i am and why i am here life is impossible my focus is to forget the pain of life forget the pain mock the pain reduce it and laugh life is lived on the edge life opens up opportunities to you and you either take them or you stay afraid of taking them part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles but in avoiding them a masterly retreat is in itself a victory never build your emotional life on the weaknesses of others justice in the life and conduct of the state is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens a dog will teach you unconditional love if you can have that in your life things wont be too bad you are doomed to make choices this is lifes greatest paradox i wish to preach not the doctrine of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the strenuous life you use your money to buy privacy because during most of your life you arent allowed to be normal i lead no party i follow no leader i have given the best part of my life to careful study of islam its law and polity its culture its history and its literature we must declare ourselves become known allow the world to discover this subterranean life of ours which connects kings and farm boys artists and clerks let them see that the important thing is not the object of love but the emotion itself faith means living with uncertainty  feeling your way through life letting your heart guide you like a lantern in the dark you see in life lots of people know what to do but few people actually do what they know knowing is not enough you must take action life is not an easy matter you cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery above weakness above all kinds of perfidy and baseness i have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream when i lock into someone or something you cant get me away from it because i commit that thoroughly thats in friendship thats a deal thats a commitment dont give me paper  i can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it but if you shake my hand thats for life find ecstasy in life the mere sense of living is joy enough you hear a lot about god these days god the beneficent god the allgreat god the almighty god the most powerful god the giver of life god the creator of death i mean were hearing about god all the time so we better learn how to deal with it but if we know anything about god god is arbitrary death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live just when i think i have learned the way to live life changes i remember a specific moment watching my grandmother hang the clothes on the line and her saying to me you are going to have to learn to do this and me being in that space of awareness and knowing that my life would not be the same as my grandmothers life when life knocks you down try to land on your back because if you can look up you can get up let your reason get you back up a lot of us grow up and we grow out of the literal interpretation that we get when were children but we bear the scars all our life whether theyre scars of beauty or scars of ugliness its pretty much in the eye of the beholder in the last analysis the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for finding himself if he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence every life has a measure of sorrow and sometimes this is what awakens us its surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves and if youre not comfortable within yourself you cant be comfortable with others my philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life but doing the best at this moment puts you i the best place for the next moment people have a moral standard about what they will do and will not do at the end of the day someone who cheats has a lower moral standard than someone who does not and they will cheat in other areas of life as well the tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives  the death of genuine feeling the death of inspired response the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself a man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror having down syndrome is like being born normal i am just like you and you are just like me we are all born in different ways that is the way i can describe it i have a normal life saving faith is an immediate relation to christ accepting receiving resting upon him alone for justification sanctification and eternal life by virtue of gods grace cease trying to work everything out with your minds it will get you nowhere live by intuition and inspiration and let your whole life be revelation if you wish to succeed in life make perseverance your bosom friend experience your wise counselor caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius i havent understood a bar of music in my life but i have felt it this is the highest wisdom that i own freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew not by appointment do we meet delight or joy they heed not our expectancy but round some corner of the streets of life they of a sudden greet us with a smile the meaning of life is contained in every single expression of life it is present in the infinity of forms and phenomena that exist in all of creation the highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence millions of young americans have graduated from college during the obama presidency ready to use their gifts and get moving in life half of them cant find the work they studied for or any work at all so heres the question without a change in leadership why would the next four years be any different from the last four years the game of life is a game of boomerangs our thoughts deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy if a man neglects education he walks lame to the end of his life all my life ive looked at words as though i were seeing them for the first time love is the greatest refreshment in life because we have so much eye candy and mind candy spending so much time trying to pay the rent all of this conspires to keep us from thinking too hard or taking action from that our time is stolen so much of our daily life is stolen i spent my whole life in the private sector 25 years in the private sector i understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people it makes it more difficult for them to buy things if they cant buy things the economy doesnt grow if the economy doesnt grow we dont put americans to work black consciousness is an attitude of the mind and a way of life the most positive call to emanate from the black world for a long time i dont believe in an afterlife so i dont have to spend my whole life fearing hell or fearing heaven even more for whatever the tortures of hell i think the boredom of heaven would be even worse the safest course is to do nothing against ones conscience with this secret we can enjoy life and have no fear from death with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy we see into the life of things to have courage for whatever comes in life  everything lies in that the changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life i have dreamed in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas they have gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind no one is in control of your happiness but you therefore you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change the purpose of human life is to serve and to show compassion and the will to help others ive made some great mistakes in my life but you know they were honest mistakes to gather with gods people in united adoration of the father is as necessary to the christian life as prayer telling a teenager the facts of life is like giving a fish a bath the good life is a process not a state of being it is a direction not a destination somebody should tell us right at the start of our lives that we are dying then we might live life to the limit every minute of every day do it i say whatever you want to do do it now there are only so many tomorrows i dont think i could live without hair makeup and styling let alone be the performer i am i am a glamour girl through and through i believe in the glamorous life and i live one the greatest humiliation in life is to work hard on something from which you expect great appreciation and then fail to get it as we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities yes you can lose somebody overnight yes your whole life can be turned upside down life is short it can come and go like a feather in the wind tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life thats really where failure comes trust is the glue of life its the most essential ingredient in effective communication its the foundational principle that holds all relationships if you find someone you love in your life then hang on to that love it is a common saying and in everybodys mouth that life is but a sojourn there is no force like success and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it as of the individual so should it be of the nation when youre passionate about something you want it to be all it can be but in the endgame of life i fundamentally believe the key to happiness is letting go of that idea of perfection being taken for granted can be a compliment it means that youve become a comfortable trusted element in another persons life the more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life the clearer we should see through it our heavenly father understands our disappointment suffering pain fear and doubt he is always there to encourage our hearts and help us understand that hes sufficient for all of our needs when i accepted this as an absolute truth in my life i found that my worrying stopped i wanted to write about the moment when your addictions no longer hide the truth from you when your whole life breaks down thats the moment when you have to somehow choose what your life is going to be about im a heroine addict i need to have sex with women who have saved someones life thank you god for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough i never regret anything because every little detail of your life is what made you into who you are in the end life belongs to the living and he who lives must be prepared for changes you cant live your life blaming your failures on your parents and what they did or didnt do for you youre dealt the cards that youre dealt i realised it was a waste of time to be angry at my parents and feel sorry for myself take a chance all life is a chance the man who goes farthest is generally the one who is willing to do and dare early in life i had to choose between honest arrogance and hypocritical humility i chose the former and have seen no reason to change what we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life there is only one success  to be able to spend your life in your own way smoking kills if youre killed youve lost a very important part of your life the highest use of capital is not to make more money but to make money do more for the betterment of life being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead friends can help each other a true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself  and especially to feel or not feel whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them thats what real love amounts to  letting a person be what he really is sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deepburning and unquenchable love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies i have decided to stick with love hate is too great a burden to bear affection is responsible for ninetenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives immature love says i love you because i need you mature love says i need you because i love you where there is love there is life were born alone we live alone we die alone only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone a loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge a man reserves his true and deepest love not for the species of woman in whose company he finds himself electrified and enkindled but for that one in whose company he may feel tenderly drowsy i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love for it was not into my ear you whispered but into my heart it was not my lips you kissed but my soul a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous let us always meet each other with smile for the smile is the beginning of love a flower cannot blossom without sunshine and man cannot live without love if you live to be a hundred i want to live to be a hundred minus one day so i never have to live without you gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love love begins at home and it is not how much we do but how much love we put in that action love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does love is a battle love is a war love is a growing up can miles truly separate you from friends if you want to be with someone you love arent you already there a woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea a man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him love is a force more formidable than any other it is invisible  it cannot be seen or measured yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment and offer you more joy than any material possession could time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity do all things with love a kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires i was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it at the touch of love everyone becomes a poet love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another love yourself first and everything else falls into line you really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world we love life not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving love is a better teacher than duty come live in my heart and pay no rent love is always bestowed as a gift  freely willingly and without expectation we dont love to be loved we love to love love is like war easy to begin but very hard to stop if you press me to say why i loved him i can say no more than because he was he and i was i the hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread love is life and if you miss love you miss life the best thing to hold onto in life is each other what we have once enjoyed we can never lose all that we love deeply becomes a part of us as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words faith makes all things possible love makes all things easy friendship often ends in love but love in friendship  never a very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue a wonderful living side by side can grow if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky the best proof of love is trust a part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve love isnt something you find love is something that finds you i like not only to be loved but also to be told i am loved we loved with a love that was more than love a pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit a loving heart is the truest wisdom all my life my heart has yearned for a thing i cannot name the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves love can sometimes be magic but magic can sometimes just be an illusion first love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired i can live without money but i cannot live without love love is the flower youve got to let grow true love is like ghosts which everyone talks about and few have seen the hours i spend with you i look upon as sort of a perfumed garden a dim twilight and a fountain singing to it you and you alone make me feel that i am alive other men it is said have seen angels but i have seen thee and thou art enough all love shifts and changes i dont know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all someday after mastering the winds the waves the tides and gravity we shall harness for god the energies of love and then for a second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire everything is clearer when youre in love the way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love i was about half in love with her by the time we sat down thats the thing about girls every time they do something pretty you fall half in love with them and then you never know where the hell you are who being loved is poor love is a game that two can play and both win for small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love the one thing we can never get enough of is love and the one thing we never give enough is love love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own the giving of love is an education in itself all mankind love a lover you will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love if you wish to be loved show more of your faults than your virtues dont brood get on with living and loving you dont have forever the moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth the delight the ecstasy of it you will discover that for you the world is transformed it is sad not to love but it is much sadder not to be able to love love is of all passions the strongest for it attacks simultaneously the head the heart and the senses the art of love is largely the art of persistence love is a friendship set to music there is no remedy for love but to love more if you want to be loved be lovable love is the beauty of the soul love possesses not nor will it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence to say i love you one must first be able to say the i before i met my husband id never fallen in love id stepped in it a few times if you would be loved love and be loveable love many things for therein lies the true strength and whosoever loves much performs much and can accomplish much and what is done in love is done well love does not dominate it cultivates only do what your heart tells you you never lose by loving you always lose by holding back love it surrounds every being and extends slowly to embrace all that shall be love is the joy of the good the wonder of the wise the amazement of the gods love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination its useless to hold a person to anything he says while hes in love drunk or running for office love is a gross exaggeration of the difference between one person and everybody else what love weve given well have forever what love we fail to give will be lost for all eternity to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already three parts dead one is loved because one is loved no reason is needed for loving love is being stupid together love is when you meet someone who tells you something new about yourself it is difficult to know at what moment love begins it is less difficult to know that it has begun how absurd and delicious it is to be in love with somebody younger than yourself everybody should try it in love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two when love is not madness it is not love the love we give away is the only love we keep love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit blessed is the influence of one true loving human soul on another to love another person is to see the face of god a kiss is a rosy dot over the i of loving love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence absence  that common cure of love life is the flower for which love is the honey the only abnormality is the incapacity to love there is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists or simulate it where it does not love consists in this that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other be of love a little more careful than of anything whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within a new command i give you love one another as i have loved you so you must love one another love is supreme and unconditional like is nice but limited gestures in love are incomparably more attractive effective and valuable than words looking back i have this to regret that too often when i loved i did not say so i love that feeling of being in love the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning that is special i believe in the compelling power of love i do not understand it i believe it to be the most fragrant blossom of all this thorny existence lord grant that i might not so much seek to be loved as to love sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence there is a woman at the begining of all great things love knows not distance it hath no continent its eyes are for the stars the sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love the degree of loving is measured by the degree of giving people think love is an emotion love is good sense love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment it is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation love is the greatest refreshment in life there is only one kind of love but there are a thousand imitations love is the delusion that one woman differs from another if you wished to be loved love love is my religion  i could die for it tell me who admires and loves you and i will tell you who you are love shall be our token love be yours and love be mine he is not a lover who does not love forever love is the hardest habit to break and the most difficult to satisfy when we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before the most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire love is all we have the only way that each can help the other choose your love love your choice falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the common sense love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few if you could only love enough you could be the most powerful person in the world to witness two lovers is a spectacle for the gods love means to commit yourself without guarantee follow love and it will flee flee love and it will follow thee the way to know life is to love many things your words are my food your breath my wine you are everything to me the fact is that love is of two kinds one which commands and one which obeys the two are quite distinct and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love love takes up where knowledge leaves off fortune and love favor the brave there is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved it is gods finger on mans shoulder each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life love is suffering one side always loves more love is what youve been through with somebody love looks through a telescope envy through a microscope love in its essence is spiritual fire there are never enough i love yous love is always being given where it is not required friendship is love without his wings come live with me and be my love and we will all the pleasures prove that valleys groves hills and fields woods or steepy mountain yields the truth is that there is only one terminal dignity  love and the story of a love is not important  what is important is that one is capable of love it is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity we are all born for love it is the principle of existence and its only end love is the poetry of the senses there is always something left to love and if you aint learned that you aint learned nothing love means to love that which is unlovable or it is no virtue at all people who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy love is not only something you feel it is something you do love is the great miracle cure loving ourselves works miracles in our lives in every living thing there is the desire for love love is but the discovery of ourselves in others and the delight in the recognition for love is immortality we may give without loving but we cannot love without giving love conquers all sometimes its hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man to love abundantly is to live abundantly and to love forever is to live forever love is that splendid triggering of human vitality the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else when you love a man he becomes more than a body his physical limbs expand and his outline recedes vanishes he is rich and sweet and right he is part of the world the atmosphere the blue sky and the blue water if you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws you can love other people so much better and that makes you so happy say what you will tis better to be left than never to have been loved sympathy constitutes friendship but in love there is a sort of antipathy or opposing passion each strives to be the other and both together make up one whole love is the power to see similarity in the dissimilar if thou must love me let it be for naught except for loves sake only take away love and our earth is a tomb love is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young the habituation of the middleaged and the mutual dependence of the old love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion do you have to have a reason for loving the first magic of love is our ignorance that it can ever end loves greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred the quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love when youre in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love or if it attributes them to her whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you from her or from the meeting of your sparks what the world really needs is more love and less paper work woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope to love  and to put its trust in life let no one who loves be unhappy even love unreturned has its rainbow i dont know that love changes people change circumstances change no one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved he who loves flies runs and rejoices he is free and nothing holds him back love is the only gold to love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides it is easier to love humanity as a whole than to love ones neighbor though lovers be lost love shall not nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold when you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out love means not ever having to say youre sorry there is no limit to the power of loving love you will find only where you may show yourself weak without provoking strength love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope even the ruins to which it clings o thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars love is a mutual selfgiving which ends in selfrecovery to love for the sake of being loved is human but to love for the sake of loving is angelic you dont want to love  your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved you arent positive youre negative you absorb absorb as if you must fill yourself up with love because youve got a shortage somewhere there is more pleasure in loving than in being beloved when love is at its best one loves so much that he cannot forget love is like a faucet it turns off and on more than kisses letters mingle souls stand by your man give him two arms to cling to and something warm to come to love is metaphysical gravity there is room in the smallest cottage for a happy loving pair who loves raves with our love we could save the world pains of love be sweeter far than all other pleasures are to good and true love fear is forever affixed what is love it is the morning and the evening star ultimately love is everything true love is quiescent except in the nascent moments of true humility only love interests me and i am only in contact with things that revolve around love you dont have to go looking for love when its where you come from it is very easy to love alone who so loves believes the impossible only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge the richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time we perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret all love is vanquished by a succeeding love we can only learn to love by loving we are most alive when were in love who ever loved that loved not at first sight love is when he gives you a piece of your soul that you never knew was missing love is an energy which exists of itself it is its own value in love there are two things  bodies and words we love but once for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving i long for the raised voice the howl of rage or love love is loves reward but loves a malady without a cure love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident a tight girdle a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over philadelphia is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being who would give a law to lovers love is unto itself a higher law love is blind when we lose one we love our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough the cure for all the ills and wrongs the cares the sorrows and the crimes of humanity all lie in the one word love it is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life oh love will make a dog howl in rhyme love is a hole in the heart love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat in our life there is a single color as on an artists palette which provides the meaning of life and art it is the color of love to enlarge or illustrate this power and effect of love is to set a candle in the sun one must not trifle with love all love is lost but upon god alone darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that life is a song  sing it life is a game  play it life is a challenge  meet it life is a dream  realize it life is a sacrifice  offer it life is love  enjoy it we must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive he who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love there is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us when we discover this we are less prone to hate our enemies love all trust a few do wrong to none when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace you can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself and that person is not to be found anywhere you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life a successful marriage requires falling in love many times always with the same person spread love everywhere you go let no one ever come to you without leaving happier i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word all major religious traditions carry basically the same message that is love compassion and forgiveness the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality this is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant to love beauty is to see light there is a sacredness in tears they are not the mark of weakness but of power they speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues they are the messengers of overwhelming grief of deep contrition and of unspeakable love my great hope is to laugh as much as i cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages love and compassion are necessities not luxuries without them humanity cannot survive dont aim for success if you want it just do what you love and believe in and it will come naturally it is easy to hate and it is difficult to love this is how the whole scheme of things works all good things are difficult to achieve and bad things are very easy to get i love people who make me laugh i honestly think its the thing i like most to laugh it cures a multitude of ills its probably the most important thing in a person when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive  to breathe to think to enjoy to love the love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge aggression and retaliation the foundation of such a method is love there can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love love begins by taking care of the closest ones  the ones at home if music be the food of love play on never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you love prayer and forgiveness if you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies  or else the chain reaction of evil  hate begetting hate wars producing more wars  must be broken or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation hatred does not cease by hatred but only by love this is the eternal rule all you need is love but a little chocolate now and then doesnt hurt happiness cannot be traveled to owned earned worn or consumed happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love grace and gratitude i love those who can smile in trouble who can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but they whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves their conduct will pursue their principles unto death if you love life dont waste time for time is what life is made up of before marriage a girl has to make love to a man to hold him after marriage she has to hold him to make love to him it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important at the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love love recognizes no barriers it jumps hurdles leaps fences penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope friends show their love in times of trouble not in happiness between men and women there is no friendship possible there is passion enmity worship love but no friendship let us more and more insist on raising funds of love of kindness of understanding of peace money will come if we seek first the kingdom of god  the rest will be given let us not be satisfied with just giving money money is not enough money can be got but they need your hearts to love them so spread your love everywhere you go you cant stop loving or wanting to love because when its right its the best thing in the world when youre in a relationship and its good even if nothing else in your life is right you feel like your whole world is complete a coward is incapable of exhibiting love it is the prerogative of the brave you cant blame gravity for falling in love never trust anyone completely but god love people but put your full trust only in god if you love someone set them free if they come back theyre yours if they dont they never were i love being married its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life if you love somebody let them go for if they return they were always yours and if they dont they never were i love you when you bow in your mosque kneel in your temple pray in your church for you and i are sons of one religion and it is the spirit i say what i want to say and do what i want to do theres no in between people will either love you for it or hate you for it it is not enough to say we must not wage war it is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection people love chopping wood in this activity one immediately sees results the foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty character integrity faith love and loyalty love is friendship that has caught fire it is quiet understanding mutual confidence sharing and forgiving it is loyalty through good and bad times it settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses if you want a love message to be heard it has got to be sent out to keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own jealousy is a disease love is a healthy condition the immature mind often mistakes one for the other or assumes that the greater the love the greater the jealousy intense love does not measure it just gives but let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls even the rich are hungry for love for being cared for for being wanted for having someone to call their own love is a fruit in season at all times and within reach of every hand i love mirrors they let one pass through the surface of things be impeccable with your word speak with integrity say only what you mean avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love the beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves and not to twist them to fit our own image otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them if we listened to our intellect wed never have a love affair wed never have a friendship wed never go into business because wed be cynical well thats nonsense youve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down kindness in words creates confidence kindness in thinking creates profoundness kindness in giving creates love anyway no drug not even alcohol causes the fundamental ills of society if were looking for the source of our troubles we shouldnt test people for drugs we should test them for stupidity ignorance greed and love of power the beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes because that is the doorway to her heart the place where love resides and ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation the things that will destroy america are prosperityatanyprice peaceatanyprice safetyfirst instead of dutyfirst the love of soft living and the getrichquick theory of life absence from those we love is self from self  a deadly banishment love of beauty is taste the creation of beauty is art i honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you men always want to be a womans first love  women like to be a mans last romance love is like a beautiful flower which i may not touch but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same i love sleep my life has the tendency to fall apart when im awake you know if we lose love and self respect for each other this is how we finally die there is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work this is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in  that we do it to god to christ and thats why we try to do it as beautifully as possible the course of true love never did run smooth i know of only one duty and that is to love one should always be in love that is the reason one should never marry weve got this gift of love but love is like a precious plant you cant just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think its going to get on by itself youve got to keep watering it youve got to really look after it and nurture it a man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her the greatest gift that you can give to others is the gift of unconditional love and acceptance many people mistake our work for our vocation our vocation is the love of jesus your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it forgiveness is the final form of love the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls i try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money no i wouldnt touch a leper for a thousand pounds yet i willingly cure him for the love of god if someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the sixties thats his problem love and peace are eternal the first duty of love is to listen i see when men love women they give them but a little of their lives but women when they love give everything work is love made visible and if you cannot work with love but only with distaste it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love god better because of them there are four questions of value in life what is sacred of what is the spirit made what is worth living for and what is worth dying for the answer to each is the same only love rare as is true love true friendship is rarer power is of two kinds one is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment we are not the same persons this year as last nor are those we love it is a happy chance if we changing continue to love a changed person god proved his love on the cross when christ hung and bled and died it was god saying to the world i love you falling in love and having a relationship are two different things accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you together but do so with all your heart trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living it is the beginning place the foundation upon which more can be built where trust is love can flourish as selfishness and complaint pervert the mind so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision when you fish for love bait with your heart not your brain i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction the man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends love is like a virus it can happen to anybody at any time it has always seemed strange to me the things we admire in men kindness and generosity openness honesty understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system and those traits we detest sharpness greed acquisitiveness meanness egotism and selfinterest are the traits of success and while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels simply by pouring out love love is infectious and the greatest healing energy christmas my child is love in action every time we love every time we give its christmas we never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves i love the man that can smile in trouble that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death love is a serious mental disease to love means loving the unlovable to forgive means pardoning the unpardonable faith means believing the unbelievable hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless i love those who yearn for the impossible love to faults is always blind always is to joy inclined lawless winged and unconfined and breaks all chains from every mind what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like the sadness of the womens movement is that they dont allow the necessity of love see i dont personally trust any revolution where love is not allowed love fall in love and stay in love write only what you love and love what you write the key word is love you have to get up in the morning and write something you love something to live for i love life because what more is there where we love is home  home that our feet may leave but not our hearts rather than love than money than fame give me truth but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust show me your hands do they have scars from giving show me your feet are they wounded in service show me your heart have you left a place for divine love once in his life every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead all everything that i understand i understand only because i love knowledge is love and light and vision love sought is good but given unsought is better i guess i have always been deeply terrified to really be someones wife since i know from life one cannot love another ever really who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make love known the game of basketball has been everything to me my place of refuge place ive always gone where i needed comfort and peace its been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction its a relationship that has evolved over time given me the greatest respect and love for the game i have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate  its apathy its not giving a damn we cant command our love but we can our actions one advantage of marriage is that when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you it keeps you together until you fall in again if you want to be successful its just this simple know what you are doing love what you are doing and believe in what you are doing politics is such a torment that i advise everyone i love not to mix with it justice that love gives is a surrender justice that law gives is a punishment find joy in everything you choose to do every job relationship home its your responsibility to love it or change it speak low if you speak love im not claiming divinity ive never claimed purity of soul ive never claimed to have the answers to life i only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as i can but i still believe in peace love and understanding true love doesnt happen right away its an evergrowing process it develops after youve gone through many ups and downs when youve suffered together cried together laughed together this is one of the miracles of love it gives a power of seeing through its own enchantments and yet not being disenchanted the best smell in the world is that man that you love love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls love is blind friendship closes its eyes love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings i do all the evil i can before i learn to shun it is it not enough to know the evil to shun it if not we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up love is too young to know what conscience is what light is to the eyes  what air is to the lungs  what love is to the heart liberty is to the soul of man love will find a way through paths where wolves fear to prey a friendship that like love is warm a love like friendship steady respect is what we owe love what we give love is not love that alters when it alteration finds where love is there god is also all you need is love women love us for our defects if we have enough of them they will forgive us everything even our gigantic intellects no matter how dark the moment love and hope are always possible when a man has once loved a woman he will do anything for her except continue to love her hatred is blind as well as love who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies the love of heaven makes one heavenly love cannot save you from your own fate love is the answer and you know that for sure love is a flower youve got to let it grow if we love our country we should also love our countrymen they do not love that do not show their love mans nature is not essentially evil brute nature has been know to yield to the influence of love you must never despair of human nature there is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love im an introvert i love being by myself love being outdoors love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees flowers the sky those whom the gods love grow young presents dont really mean much to me i dont want to sound mawkish but  it was the realization that i have a great many people in my life who really love me and who i really love flatter me and i may not believe you criticize me and i may not like you ignore me and i may not forgive you encourage me and i will not forget you love me and i may be forced to love you is it not enough to know the evil to shun it if not we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up love is never lost if not reciprocated it will flow back and soften and purify the heart do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman wholl give you a little love a little affection a little tenderness it means youre in the wrong house thats what it means yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors but today we kneel only to truth follow only beauty and obey only love the motherchild relationship is paradoxical and in a sense tragic it requires the most intense love on the mothers side yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother and to become fully independent ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country love is trembling happiness even when im old and grey i wont be able to play it but ill still love the game i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge that myth is more potent than history that dreams are more powerful than facts that hope always triumphs over experience that laughter is the only cure for grief and i believe that love is stronger than death dont do anything by half if you love someone love them with all your soul when you go to work work your ass off when you hate someone hate them until it hurts love and doubt have never been on speaking terms a dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life dost thou love life then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of money cant buy love but it improves your bargaining position do not hire a man who does your work for money but him who does it for love of it i wish people would love everybody else the way they love me it would be a better world alcohol may be mans worst enemy but the bible says love your enemy age does not protect you from love but love to some extent protects you from age ill love you dear ill love you till china and africa meet and the river jumps over the mountain and the salmon sing in the street if you cannot work with love but only with distaste it is better that you should leave your work love is the expression of ones values the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another personally i just think rap music is the best thing out there period if you look at my deck in my car radio youre always going to find a hiphop tape thats all i buy thats all i live thats all i listen to thats all i love success comes from taking the initiative and following up persisting eloquently expressing the depth of your love what simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine where theres marriage without love there will be love without marriage i love to be alone i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude he who falls in love with himself will have no rivals the story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye the story of love is hello goodbye when people get married because they think its a longtime love affair theyll be divorced very soon because all love affairs end in disappointment but marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness when love beckons to you follow him though his ways are hard and steep and when his wings enfold you yield to him though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you coming generations will learn equality from poverty and love from woes mothers love is peace it need not be acquired it need not be deserved if a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer but if he spends his days as a speculator shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen the two most misused words in the entire english vocabulary are love and friendship a true friend would die for you so when you start trying to count them on one hand you dont need any fingers there is always some madness in love but there is also always some reason in madness there is no love without forgiveness and there is no forgiveness without love three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for today i love myself as i love my god who could charge me with a sin today i know only sins against my god but who knows my god i know youve heard it a thousand times before but its true  hard work pays off if you want to be good you have to practice practice practice if you dont love something then dont do it one is very crazy when in love it is cruel you know that music should be so beautiful it has the beauty of loneliness of pain of strength and freedom the beauty of disappointment and neversatisfied love the cruel beauty of nature and everlasting beauty of monotony men love to wonder and that is the seed of science do what you love know your own bone gnaw at it bury it unearth it and gnaw it still anxiety is loves greatest killer it makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you you want to save him but you know he will strangle you with his panic guilt for being rich and guilt thinking that perhaps love and peace isnt enough and you have to go and get shot or something i have found that if you love life life will love you back truth is handsomer than the affectation of love your goodness must have some edge to it else it is none because of a great love one is courageous there is not enough love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary beings i have no hostility to nature but a childs love to it i expand and live in the warm day like corn and melons for though we love both the truth and our friends piety requires us to honor the truth first a father may turn his back on his child brothers and sisters may become inveterate enemies husbands may desert their wives wives their husbands but a mothers love endures through all the greatest healing therapy is friendship and love death is a challenge it tells us not to waste time it tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other hallow the body as a temple to comeliness and sanctify the heart as a sacrifice to love love recompenses the adorers sex without love is a meaningless experience but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good i think my passion is misinterpreted as anger sometimes and i dont think people are ready for the message that im delivering and delivering with a sense of violent love a scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar if the great way perishes there will morality and duty when cleverness and knowledge arise great lies will flourish when relatives fall out with one another there will be filial duty and love when states are in confusion there will be faithful servants what do i care about the purring of one who cannot love like the cat no matter what youve done for yourself or for humanity if you cant look back on having given love and attention to your own family what have you really accomplished not necessity not desire  no the love of power is the demon of men let them have everything  health food a place to live entertainment  they are and remain unhappy and lowspirited for the demon waits and waits and will be satisfied the wise are wise only because they love the fool are fools only because they think they can understand love pursue some path however narrow and crooked in which you can walk with love and reverence you dont have to deserve your mothers love you have to deserve your fathers love thy neighbor  and if he happens to be tall debonair and devastating it will be that much easier a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others for anything worth having one must pay the price and the price is always work patience love selfsacrifice  no paper currency no promises to pay but the gold of real service a woman can bring a new love to each man she loves providing there are not too many men who think that a womans past love affairs lessen her love for them are usually stupid and weak i love a natural look in pictures experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love for a lasting union they insist there must be a genuine liking for each other which in my book is a good definition for friendship someday i want to have children and give them all the love i never had i am good but not an angel i do sin but i am not the devil i am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love a strong man doesnt have to be dominant toward a woman he doesnt match his strength against a woman weak with love for him he matches it against the world i love those who do not know how to live for today love is not consolation it is light if youre married and you have a wife and you really love your wife is it good enough to only say to your wife i love her the day you get married or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity and thats how i feel about my relationship with jesus christ is that it is the most important thing in my life friendship may and often does grow into love but love never subsides into friendship this is the hardest of all to close the open hand out of love and keep modest as a giver whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil love matches so called have illusion for their father and need for their mother success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful never go on trips with anyone you do not love work like you dont need the money love like youve never been hurt dance like nobodys watching a woman in love cant be reasonable  or she probably wouldnt be in love love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get  only with what you are expecting to give  which is everything we all want to be in love and find that person who is going to love us no matter how our feet smell no matter how angry we get one day no matter the things we say that we dont mean a tree is known by its fruit a man by his deeds a good deed is never lost he who sows courtesy reaps friendship and he who plants kindness gathers love the great gift of easter is hope  christian hope which makes us have that confidence in god in his ultimate triumph and in his goodness and love which nothing can shake fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soaponarope there is no lonelier man in death except the suicide than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it of all that is written i love only what a person has written with his own blood there is no sincerer love than the love of food ignorance and bungling with love are better than wisdom and skill without honestly id love to be remembered as one of the best to ever pick up a mic but if im doing my part to lessen some racial tension i feel good about what im doing those whom we can love we can hate to others we are indifferent the time i burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice you sacrifice the things you love i love my guitar you can give without loving but you can never love without giving i love the attention but i dont like too much of it do not seek the because  in love there is no because no reason no explanation no solutions a man in love is incomplete until he has married then hes finished i have an everyday religion that works for me love yourself first and everything else falls into line a poet never takes notes you never take notes in a love affair so much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty all other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it because parents have power over children they feel they have to do what their parents say but the love of money is the root of all evil and this is a sweet child and to see him turn like this this isnt him this is not him for one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks the ultimate the last test and proof the work for which all other work is but preparation loyalty and devotion lead to bravery bravery leads to the spirit of selfsacrifice the spirit of selfsacrifice creates trust in the power of love the perfect love affair is one which is conducted entirely by post let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation i love mickey mouse more than any woman i have ever known love comes when manipulation stops when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you when you dare to reveal yourself fully when you dare to be vulnerable life in abundance comes only through great love love and desire are the spirits wings to great deeds everyone has inside of him a piece of good news the good news is that you dont know how great you can be how much you can love what you can accomplish and what your potential is love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives the only creatures that are evolved enough to convey pure love are dogs and infants infuse your life with action dont wait for it to happen make it happen make your own future make your own hope make your own love and whatever your beliefs honor your creator not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high but by doing what you can to make grace happen yourself right now right down here on earth its funny how most people love the dead once youre dead your made for life having a child is surely the most beautifully irrational act that two people in love can commit jealousy contains more of selflove than of love since love grows within you so beauty grows for love is the beauty of the soul may we so love as never to have occasion to repent of our love you either love or you hate you live in the middle you get nothing you gotta love livin baby cause dyin is a pain in the ass it is most unwise for people in love to marry the struggle of my life created empathy  i could relate to pain being abandoned having people not love me three passions simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life the longing for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live let the beauty of what you love be what you do oh the tiger will love you there is no sincerer love than the love of food heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned nor hell a fury like a woman scorned only on paper has humanity yet achieved glory beauty truth knowledge virtue and abiding love my friends and family are my support system they tell me what i need to hear not what i want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times without them i have no idea where i would be and i know that their love for me is whats keeping my head above the water the fickleness of the women i love is only equalled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me i will love the light for it shows me the way yet i will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars love is always open arms if you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself love grows by giving the love we give away is the only love we keep the only way to retain love is to give it away let your religion be less of a theory and more of a love affair all the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers if every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family  and gods love  this world would be a far more gentle and better place the love of economy is the root of all virtue courage is like love it must have hope for nourishment i believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear if love is the answer could you please rephrase the question all the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not kill you shall not steal you shall not covet and so on are summed up in this single command you must love your neighbor as yourself no work or love will flourish out of guilt fear or hollowness of heart just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now to love rightly is to love what is orderly and beautiful in an educated and disciplined way christmas in bethlehem the ancient dream a cold clear night made brilliant by a glorious star the smell of incense shepherds and wise men falling to their knees in adoration of the sweet baby the incarnation of perfect love fantasy love is much better than reality love never doing it is very exciting the most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet the most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create to overcome to endure to transform to love and to be greater than our suffering i come from that society and there is a common thread specifically family values  the idea that you do anything for your family and the unconditional love for ones children when women love us they forgive us everything even our crimes when they do not love us they give us credit for nothing not even our virtues anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love love conquers all things except poverty and toothache we always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love  first to their advantage then to their disadvantage let love flow so that it cleanses the world then man can live in peace instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life with all those material interests and earthly ambitions the reason men oppose progress is not that they hate progress but that they love inertia love we say is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death lord make me an instrument of thy peace where there is hatred let me sow love you dont have to be singing about love all the time in order to give love to the people you dont have to keep flashing those words all the time dont forget to love yourself we are never so defensless against suffering as when we love all women have a perception much more developed than men so all women somehow being repressed for so many millennia they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love and this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society there is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love theres only scarcity of resolve to make it happen its not an act i love it its totally original people go whats going on with this guy why does he sound so weird what is going on in his brain i dont know just one day i suddenly woke up with a new brain never make your home in a place make a home for yourself inside your own head youll find what you need to furnish it  memory friends you can trust love of learning and other such things that way it will go with you wherever you journey if i love you what business is it of yours i often try to tell kids to think about all the people who love you dont cry over the one person who doesnt when you have really exhausted an experience you always reverence and love it where there is great love there are always wishes sex without love is merely healthy exercise its funny the way most people love the dead once you are dead you are made for life we need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives mankinds greatest gift also its greatest curse is that we have free choice we can make our choices built from love or from fear love always creates it never destroys in this lies mans only promise animals are reliable many full of love true in their affections predictable in their actions grateful and loyal difficult standards for people to live up to love may be or it may not but where it is it ought to reveal itself in its immensity i love to go to washington  if only to be near my money may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live to keep your marriage brimming with love in the loving cup whenever youre wrong admit it whenever youre right shut up the eskimos had fiftytwo names for snow because it was important to them there ought to be as many for love we the people recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks whats in it for me a freedom without a commitment to others a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense man is an idea and a precious small idea once he turns his back on love the desire for possession is insatiable to such a point that it can survive even love itself to love therefore is to sterilize the person one loves ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others by means of love friendship indignation and compassion i am certainly not an authority on love because there are no authorities on love just those whove had luck with it and those who havent to abandon oneself to principles is really to die  and to die for an impossible love which is the contrary of love friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love humanity i love you because when youre hard up you pawn your intelligence to buy a drink i do not deny that i planned sabotage i did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because i have any love of violence i planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites give a child love laughter and peace not aids a good teacher can inspire hope ignite the imagination and instill a love of learning in the silence of night i have often wished for just a few words of love from one man rather than the applause of thousands of people music is love love is music music is life and i love my life thank you and good night the ultimate lesson all of us have to learn is unconditional love which includes not only others but ourselves as well love isnt an emotion or an instinct  its an art my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an african name barack or blessed believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success love a temporary insanity curable by marriage hate is only a form love that hasnt found a way to express itself logically i met in the street a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat worn his cloak was out at the elbows the water passed through his shoes  and the stars through his soul enlightened leadership is spiritual if we understand spirituality not as some kind of religious dogma or ideology but as the domain of awareness where we experience values like truth goodness beauty love and compassion and also intuition creativity insight and focused attention no one is a friend to his friend who does not love in return true love comes quietly without banners or flashing lights if you hear bells get your ears checked it is not love that should be depicted as blind but selflove nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love i will not be just a tourist in the world of images just watching images passing by which i cannot live in make love to possess as permanent sources of joy and ecstasy i love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station through which god speaks to us every hour if we will only tune in i like america just as everybody else does i love america i gotta say that but america will be judged may we not succumb to thoughts of violence and revenge today but rather to thoughts of mercy and compassion we are to love our enemies that they might be returned to their right minds for true love is inexhaustible the more you give the more you have and if you go to draw at the true fountainhead the more water you draw the more abundant is its flow were not raising children with the love that we need to there is something in the unselfish and selfsacrificing love of a brute which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man what i needed most was to love and to be loved eager to be caught happily i wrapped those painful bonds around me and sure enough i would be lashed with the redhot pokers or jealousy by suspicions and fear by burst of anger and quarrels love is the ultimate theme but its not just for women it is impossible to love and to be wise my number one goal is to love support and be there for my son food love career and mothers the four major guilt groups there is no friendship no love like that of the parent for the child i never knew how to worship until i knew how to love the essential elements of giving are power and love  activity and affection  and the consciousness of the race testifies that in the high and appropriate exercise of these is a blessedness greater than any other i love being black in america and especially being black in hollywood love seeks one thing only the good of the one loved it leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves love therefore is its own reward there is only one secure foundation a genuine deep relationship with jesus christ which will carry you through any and all turmoil no matter what storms are raging all around youll stand firm if you stand on his love if you love someone you say it right then out loud otherwise the moment just passes you by its tangible its solid its beautiful its artistic from my standpoint and i just love real estate love can consign us to hell or to paradise but it always takes us somewhere if you find someone you love in your life then hang on to that love thank you god for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough those who intend on becoming great should love neither themselves nor their own things but only what is just whether it happens to be done by themselves or others disneyland is a work of love we didnt go into disneyland just with the idea of making money i love it when someone insults me that means that i dont have to be nice anymore any fool knows that bravado is always a coverup for insecurity thats the truth and on that note ill say goodnight god love you look your best  who said love is blind the greatest pleasure of life is love love implies anger the man who is angered by nothing cares about nothing believe in love believe in magic hell believe in santa clause believe in others believe in yourself believe in your dreams if you dont who will i love producing i am loving doing that i think that is my most natural space in the business i just love producing or editing and thats where i thrive i believe in an america where millions of americans believe in an america thats the america millions of americans believe in thats the america i love girls we love for what they are young men for what they promise to be i love women but i feel like you cant trust some of them some of them are liars you know like i was in the park and i met this girl she was cute and she had a dog and i went up to her we started talking she told me her dogs name then i said does he bite she said no and i said oh yeah then how does he eat liar if having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude then animals are better off than a lot of humans there are more love songs than anything else if songs could make you do something wed all love one another americans love to fight all real americans love the sting of battle love feels no burden thinks nothing of trouble attempts what is above its strength pleads no excuse of impossibility for it thinks all things lawful for itself and all things possible young love is a flame very pretty often very hot and fierce but still only light and flickering the love of the older and disciplined heart is as coals deepburning unquenchable im in trouble because im normal and slightly arrogant a lot of people dont like themselves and i happen to be totally in love with myself the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge what i know is is that if you do work that you love and the work fulfills you the rest will come some white people hate black people and some white people love black people some black people hate white people and some black people love white people so you see its not an issue of black and white its an issue of lovers and haters i love romance im a sucker for it i love it so much its pathetic start living now stop saving the good china for that special occasion stop withholding your love until that special person materializes every day you are alive is a special occasion every minute every breath is a gift from god im not saying that love always takes you to heaven your life can become a nightmare but that said it is worth taking the risk what i cannot love i overlook is that real friendship i love argument i love debate i dont expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me thats not their job ask those who love him with a sincere love and they will tell you that they find no greater or prompter relief amid the troubles of their life than in loving conversation with their divine friend love does not claim possession but gives freedom love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness whoever loves becomes humble those who love have so to speak pawned a part of their narcissism if love does not know how to give and take without restrictions it is not love but a transaction that never fails to lay stress on a plus and a minus acceptance is not love you love a person because he or she has lovable traits but you accept everybody just because theyre alive and human and i ask why am i black they say i was born in sin and shamed inequity one of the main songs we used to sing in church makes me sick love wash me and i shall be whiter than snow love has features which pierce all hearts he wears a bandage which conceals the faults of those beloved he has wings he comes quickly and flies away the same well love is insanity the ancient greeks knew that it is the taking over of a rational and lucid mind by delusion and selfdestruction you lose yourself you have no power over yourself you cant even think straight i love you the more in that i believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else true love stories never have endings its good for everyone to understand that they are to love their enemies simply because your enemies show you things about yourself you need to change so in actuality enemies are friends in reverse faith is love taking the form of aspiration i always like to win but im the big sister i want to make sure she has everything even if i dont have anything its hard i love her too much thats what counts behold my friends the spring is come the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun and we shall soon see the results of their love a bells not a bell til you ring it a songs not a song til you sing it love in your heart wasnt put there to stay love isnt love til you give it away it is not the creation of wealth that is wrong but the love of money for its own sake depression is when you have lots of love but no ones taking i think what motivates people is not great hate but great love for other people we cant form our children on our own concepts we must take them and love them as god gives them to us treasure the love you receive above all it will survive long after your good health has vanished you should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit its one of the major happinesses and so much more lasting than love so much less costly in emotional wear and tear all men and women have an equal need for love when these needs are not fulfilled it is easy to have our feelings hurt for which we blame our partner i love my family very much i wish i could see them a little more often than i do but we understand because were a show business family and we all work we do not judge the people we love love cannot endure indifference it needs to be wanted like a lamp it needs to be fed out of the oil of anothers heart or its flame burns low trust in what you love continue to do it and it will take you where you need to go for love would be love of the wrong thing there is yet faith but the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting grief is the price we pay for love i love blackjack but im not addicted to gambling im addicted to sitting in a semi circle i love everything thats old  old friends old times old manners old books old wine he that is jealous is not in love the hardest people to reach with the love of god are not the bad people they know they are bad they have no defense the hardest ones to win for god are the selfrighteous people but when women are moved and lend help when women who are by nature calm and controlled give encouragement and applause when virtuous and knowledgeable women grace the endeavor with their sweet love then it is invincible if a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment or an enlarged egotism love has its place as does hate peace has its place as does war mercy has its place as do cruelty and revenge you can never control who you fall in love with even when youre in the most sad confused time of your life you dont fall in love with people because theyre fun it just happens i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing my mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all  the gift of unconditional love they cared deeply about who we would be and much less about what we would do i do not want a husband who honours me as a queen if he does not love me as a woman women have simple tastes they get pleasure out of the conversation of children in arms and men in love love is a trap when it appears we see only its light not its shadows i do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success such emotions make a man forget food sleep friends love everything i cant imagine anything more worthwhile than doing what i most love and they pay me for it if you love those who love you what credit is that to you for even sinners love those who love them and if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you for even sinners do the same there is only one happiness in this life to love and be loved it is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults so to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him and to speak painful truth through loving words that is friendship it is not love that is blind but jealousy romantic love is mental illness but its a pleasurable one its a drug it distorts reality and thats the point of it it would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate authenticity is the alignment of head mouth heart and feet  thinking saying feeling and doing the same thing  consistently this builds trust and followers love leaders they can trust the truth is i love being alive and i love feeling free so if i cant have those things then i feel like a caged animal and id rather not be in a cage id rather be dead and its real simple and i think its not that uncommon the opposite of love is not hate its indifference and a special thank you to the citizens of massachusetts you are paying all the taxes creating all the jobs raising all the children this government is yours thank you for letting me serve you i love this job the most important thing in the world is family and love love is the most important thing in the world hate we should remove from the dictionary love is moral even without legal marriage but marriage is immoral without love among those whom i like or admire i can find no common denominator but among those whom i love i can all of them make me laugh one cannot think well love well sleep well if one has not dined well accept that all of us can be hurt that all of us can and surely will at times fail other vulnerabilities like being embarrassed or risking love can be terrifying too i think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk all brave men love for he only is brave who has affections to fight for whether in the daily battle of life or in physical contests i am not a vegetarian because i love animals i am a vegetarian because i hate plants how i love lucy was born we decided that instead of divorce lawyers profiting from our mistakes wed profit from them love is the answer to everything its the only reason to do anything if you dont write stories you love youll never make it if you dont write stories that other people love youll never make it computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams but no machine can replace the human spark of spirit compassion love and understanding the more i think about it the more i realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion her intelligence reflected in my daughters love like a chicken salad or restaurant hash must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor so long as we love we serve so long as we are loved by others i should say that we are almost indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend true love is eternal infinite and always like itself it is equal and pure without violent demonstrations it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart music is what i breath what i love to do it keeps me alive passion is momentary love is enduring to fall in love is easy even to remain in it is not difficult our human loneliness is cause enough but it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be as much as i would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time that doesnt work for me id just rather sit at home and read or go out to dinner with someone or talk to someone i love or talk to somebody that makes me laugh this is love to fly toward a secret sky to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment first to let go of life finally to take a step without feet i love you more than my own skin first and last what is demanded of genius is love of truth we cannot fashion our children after our desires we must have them and love them as god has given them to us to be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia  to mistake an ordinary young woman for a goddess i love to put on lotion sometimes ill watch tv and go into a lotion trance for an hour i try to find brands that dont taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me prayer does not use up artificial energy doesnt burn up any fossil fuel doesnt pollute neither does song neither does love neither does the dance i love wagner but the music i prefer is that of a cat hung up by its tail outside a window and trying to stick to the panes of glass with its claws love can do much but duty more about all you can do in life is be who you are some people will love you for you most will love you for what you can do for them and some wont like you at all love consists in giving without getting in return in giving what is not owed what is not due the other thats why true love is never based as associations for utility or pleasure are on a fair exchange i have a love interest in every one of my films a gun there is no time for cutanddried monotony there is time for work and time for love that leaves no other time i dont know if i believe in love at first sight but of course i believe in two people having chemistry right away a girl should be really easy to talk to when i lose track of time because weve been talking i think thats really fun if there is such a thing as a good marriage it is because it resembles friendship rather than love there are fathers who do not love their children there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson sex is a part of love you shouldnt go around doing it unless you are in love when i see children i see the face of god thats why i love them so much thats what i see in art as in love instinct is enough love always involves responsibility and love always involves sacrifice and we do not really love christ unless we are prepared to face his task and to take up his cross listen to your innervoice surround yourself with loving nurturing people fall in love with your art and find yourself music is the great communicator everything that i love is behind those gates we have elephants and giraffes and crocodiles and every kind of tigers and lions and  and we have bus loads of kids who dont get to see those things they come up sick children and enjoy it love him and let him love you do you think anything else under heaven really matters a lot of women dont know how to love because theres deep reasons for them not knowing how to love and what i mean by deep reasons is deep and dark reasons romantic love is an illusion most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames only the really plain people know about love  the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents the more one does and sees and feels the more one is able to do and the more genuine may be ones appreciation of fundamental things like home and love and understanding companionship what i am is how i came out no ones perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself a man always remembers his first love with special tenderness but after that he begins to bunch them marriage is not a noun its a verb it isnt something you get its something you do its the way you love your partner every day i love cats because i enjoy my home and little by little they become its visible soul there is a courtesy of the heart it is allied to love from its springs the purest courtesy in the outward behavior if one is desperate for love i suggest looking at ones friends and family and see if love is all around if not get a new set of friends a new family all married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love good battle is objective and honest  never vicious or cruel good battle is healthy and constructive and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership basketball is my passion i love it but my family and friends mean everything to me thats whats important i need my phone so i can keep in contact with them at all times the first symptom of love in a young man is timidity in a girl boldness if jesus was here do you think jesus would show me any love do you think jesus would love me ive only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror a poet is before anything else a person who is passionately in love with language i just want to do what i do best and thats fight i love it however rare true love may be it is less so than true friendship the body is a house of many windows there we all sit showing ourselves and crying on the passersby to come and love us alcohol is like love the first kiss is magic the second is intimate the third is routine after that you take the girls clothes off it is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us but not impossible that it may respect or sympathize so a man would rather leave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face love seeketh not itself to please nor for itself hath any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven in hells despair adultery is the application of democracy to love friendship at first sight like love at first sight is said to be the only truth when you start falling for somebody and you cant stop thinking about when youre going to see them again i love that women are beautiful they deserve to be cherished and respected the bee gees who are brilliant i just love great music i feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people im a romantic and we romantics are more sensitive to the way people feel we love more and we hurt more when were hurt we hurt for a long time what ive enjoyed most though is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them good food is a global thing and i find that there is always something new and amazing to learn  i love it love is the delightful interval between meeting a beautiful girl and discovering that she looks like a haddock i love bringing roses to a woman when she least expects it dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved i love power but it is as an artist that i love it i love it as a musician loves his violin to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies all happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love i might get drunk one day and fall in love or fall over a hooker outside and i would have consummated a relationship that i couldnt necessarily believe in love and work work and love thats all there is ill come and make love to you at five oclock if im late start without me love is what we were born with fear is what we learned here it sounds like a cliche but i also learnt that youre not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are love is an emotion that is based on an opinion of women that is impossible for those who have had any experience with them life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us oh be swift to love make haste to be kind if you have love in your life it can make up for a great many things that are missing if you dont have love in your life no matter what else there is its not enough ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society unless you love someone nothing else makes any sense i think careful cooking is love dont you the loveliest thing you can cook for someone whos close to you is about as nice a valentine as you can give above our life we love a steadfast friend mothers are the people who love us for no good reason and those of us who are mothers know its the most exquisite love of all ive told billy if i ever caught him cheating i wouldnt kill him because i love his children and they need a dad but i would beat him up i know where all of his sports injuries are the distinction between children and adults while probably useful for some purposes is at bottom a specious one i feel there are only individual egos crazy for love first love is first love first marriage is first marriage disappointment is disappointment so fall asleep love loved by me for i know love i am loved by thee the three hardest tasks in the world are neither physical feats nor intellectual achievements but moral acts to return love for hate to include the excluded and to say i was wrong well love you just the way you are if youre perfect if were destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff theres got to be a very powerful energy to fight that i think we need more love in the world we need more kindness more compassion more joy more laughter i definitely want to contribute to that we dont believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack from your parents you learn love and laughter and how to put one foot before the other but when books are opened you discover that you have wings smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women a test of a people is how it behaves toward the old it is easy to love children even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children but the affection and care for the old the incurable the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture falling out of love is chiefly a matter of forgetting how charming someone is our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better a flower falls even though we love it and a weed grows even though we do not love it chemistry can be a good and bad thing chemistry is good when you make love with it chemistry is bad when you make crack with it when you are older you will understand how precious little things seemingly of no value in themselves can be loved and prized above all price when they convey the love and thoughtfulness of a good heart if you dont love me it does not matter anyway i can love for both of us i love my family and i miss them very much but im a new person now i know a lot of people will not agree with what ive done but it was right for me you dont have to love them you just have to respect their rights the love of a mother is the veil of a softer light between the heart and the heavenly father people love westerns worldwide theres something fantasylike about an individual fighting the elements or even bad guys and the elements its a simpler time theres no organized laws and stuff true love doesnt come to you it has to be inside you even though i love solar and love wind like most people do i like the renewable sources they alone are not going to get america energy independent this is the america that i love this is a great people we can do anything we can achieve anything weve got a government that has gotten in the way of the american people were going to change that in november a man without ambition is dead a man with ambition but no love is dead a man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it love is a portion of the soul itself and it is of the same nature as the celestial breathing of the atmosphere of paradise black as the devil hot as hell pure as an angel sweet as love and i love that even in the toughest moments when were all sweating it  when were worried that the bill wont pass and it seems like all is lost  barack never lets himself get distracted by the chatter and the noise just like his grandmother he just keeps getting up and moving forward with patience and wisdom and courage and grace love never dies of starvation but often of indigestion love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain it there is nothing i love as much as a good fight just dont give up trying to do what you really want to do where there is love and inspiration i dont think you can go wrong everyone got kind of crazy with me mentioning i was in love with a woman there is a fountain of youth it is your mind your talents the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love when you learn to tap this source you will truly have defeated age the highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy but a love of ones country deep enough to call her to a higher plain in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make love is an attempt at penetrating another being but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual people everywhere love windows love is easy and i love writing you cant resist love you get an idea someone says something and youre in love act happy feel happy be happy without a reason in the world then you can love and do what you will i love you and because i love you i would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies if youre lucky enough to have a pretty girl love you and share herself and sleep with you make that your secret the best way to spoil love is by talking to too many people about it i tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth  and truth rewarded me i say to people who care for people who are dying if you really love that person and want to help them be with them when their end comes close sit with them  you dont even have to talk you dont have to do anything but really be there with them at best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love but it is also all too often where we learn nasty things like hate rage and shame true love cannot be found where it does not exist nor can it be denied where it does if thou desire the love of god and man be humble for the proud heart as it loves none but itself is beloved of none but itself humility enforces where neither virtue nor strength nor reason can prevail no woman ever hates a man for being in love with her but many a woman hate a man for being a friend to her to live in this world you must be able to do three things to love what is mortal to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it and when the time comes to let it go to let it go there isnt any formula or method you learn to love by loving  by paying attention and doing what one thereby discovers has to be done age does not protect you from love but love to some extent protects you from age the planter the farmer the mechanic and the laborer form the great body of the people of the united states they are the bone and sinew of the country men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws you dont walk away if you love someone you help the person love is union with somebody or something outside oneself under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of ones own self where love rules there is no will to power and where power predominates there love is lacking the one is the shadow of the other if one of two lovers is loyal and the other jealous and false how may their friendship last for love is slain those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body in our minds love and lust are really separated its hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with and isnt afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe why love if losing hurts so much i have no answers anymore only the life i have lived the pain now is part of the happiness then i love to hit people i love to im getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because i just cant stop lifting it and i love that you know we abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us when we see land as a community to which we belong we may begin to use it with love and respect i usually get myself into situations that cause sparks i mean im a girl that likes the storms i love feeling alive i love walking out in the cold in my bare feet and feeling the ice on my toes it is with an old love as it is with old age a man lives to all the miseries but is dead to all the pleasures there is hardly any activity any enterprise which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations and yet which fails so regularly as love it is not in the power of even the most crafty dissimulation to conceal love long where it really is nor to counterfeit it long where it is not love and kindness are never wasted they always make a difference they bless the one who receives them and they bless you the giver it is a great consolation for me to remember that the lord to whom i had drawn near in humble and childlike faith has suffered and died for me and that he will look on me in love and compassion the impulse to cruelty is in many people almost as violent as the impulse to sexual love  almost as violent and much more mischievous i love the name of honor more than i fear death love is friendship set on fire you are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you theyre right to think that about me because im the person most likely to sleep with my female fans i genuinely love other women and i think they know that a wedding anniversary is the celebration of love trust partnership tolerance and tenacity the order varies for any given year the only thing we never get enough of is love and the only thing we never give enough of is love love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect considering their value on the personality market you know all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy everything else is just sprinkles on the sundae nobody loves a woman because she is handsome or ugly stupid or intelligent we love because we love everyone can relate to love hurt pain learning how to forgive needing to get over needing the power of god in their life i have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion  i have shuddered at it i shudder no more  i could be martyred for my religion  love is my religion  i could die for that when i sing i feel like when youre first in love its more than sex its that point two people can get to they call love when you really touch someone for the first time but its gigantic multiplied by the whole audience i feel chills a woman has two smiles that an angel might envy the smile that accepts a lover before words are uttered and the smile that lights on the first born babe and assures it of a mothers love a lot of times black folks look for love in all the wrong places youre always looking for somebody to love you be accepted and theres the insecurities that are even transmitted through rap everyone is trying to aim to please too much men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear i think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved i know that i can give love for a minute for half an hour for a day for a month but i can give i am very happy to do that i want to do that the love of learning the sequestered nooks and all the sweet serenity of books dont threaten me with love baby lets just go walking in the rain men often pass from love to ambition but they seldom come back again from ambition to love if you cannot inspire a woman with love of you fill her above the brim with love of herself all that runs over will be yours i understand now that the vulnerability ive always felt is the greatest strength a person can have you cant experience life without feeling life what ive learned is that being vulnerable to somebody you love is not a weakness its a strength if a man is truly in love the most beautiful woman in the world couldnt take him away maybe for a few days but not forever if i think more about death than some other people it is probably because i love life more than they do love is the river of life in the world the love that lasts longest is the love that is never returned i love quotations because it is a joy to find thoughts one might have beautifully expressed with much authority by someone recognized wiser than oneself if so many men so many minds certainly so many hearts so many kinds of love love is anterior to life posterior to death initial of creation and the exponent of breath tell the truth sing with passion work with laughter love with heart cause thats all that matters in the end getting divorced just because you dont love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do give a little love to a child and you get a great deal back it is with true love as it is with ghosts everyone talks about it but few have seen it he who knows no hardships will know no hardihood he who faces no calamity will need no courage mysterious though it is the characteristics in human nature which we love best grow in a soil with a strong mixture of troubles love is never defeated and i could add the history of ireland proves it i love chicken i would eat chicken fingers on thanksgiving if it were socially acceptable in friendship as well as love ignorance very often contributes more to our happiness than knowledge neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius love love love that is the soul of genius the motto of chivalry is also the motto of wisdom to serve all but love only one when we ask for love we dont ask others to be fair to usbut rather to care for us to be considerate of us there is a world of difference here between demanding justice and begging or pleading for love he who does not love his own language is worse than an animal and smelly fish the secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person you know theyre right if you love to be with them all the time we always love those who admire us but we do not always love those whom we admire when people are lame they love to blame when youre taught to love everyone to love your enemies then what value does that place on love a james cagney love scene is one where he lets the other guy live we are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us more than we wish if love is the treasure laughter is the key i am deeply grateful to the citizens of sarajevo and the sarajevo canton assembly for bestowing upon me this incredible honor of citizenship i am so proud to now be a part of such an extraordinary part of the world and fellow citizen to the people i deeply love and admire you will reciprocally promise love loyalty and matrimonial honesty we only want for you this day that these words constitute the principle of your entire life and that with the help of divine grace you will observe these solemn vows that today before god you formulate my trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life is what keeps me moving forward if you love something let it go free if it doesnt come back you never had it if it comes back love it forever i love my children beyond all reason theyre my joy even when theyre wild with kid energy we may sooner be brought to love them that hate us than them that love us more than we would have them do little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between love and duty love has its own time its own season and its own reasons from coming and going you cannot bribe it or coerce it or reason it into staying you can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you love does not alter the beloved it alters itself we pardon to the extent that we love this love is silent to love someone means to see him as god intended him love can no more continue without a constant motion than fire can and when once you take hope and fear away you take from it its very life and being let us be about setting high standards for life love creativity and wisdom if our expectations in these areas are low we are not likely to experience wellness setting high standards makes every day and every decade worth looking forward to art is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon when we love a woman we dont start measuring her limbs just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other to let their souls blend in a soft whisper so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can as it were creep into god romance is tempestuous love is calm where love is concerned too much is not even enough i really love idiot enlightened characters  these characters who fail to engage with the drama of their immediate circumstances they fail to be reactive and enrolled by drama as it happens around them this is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love the more they give the more they possess the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death a religious man is a person who holds god and man in one thought at one time at all times who suffers harm done to others whose greatest passion is compassion whose greatest strength is love and defiance of despair i did not just fall in love i made a parachute jump metaphors are dangerous love begins with a metaphor which is to say love begins at the point when a woman enters her first word into our poetic memory at the end of the day you know love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish even if a unity of faith is not possible a unity of love is let us not seek the republican answer or the democratic answer but the right answer let us not seek to fix the blame for the past let us accept our own responsibility for the future suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of congress but i repeat myself one of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors if you put the federal government in charge of the sahara desert in 5 years thered be a shortage of sand it is enough that the people know there was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything it is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness i am extraordinarily patient provided i get my own way in the end if you have ten thousand regulations you destroy all respect for the law healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary democracy is when the indigent and not the men of property are the rulers politics is not a game it is an earnest business whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices a rottenness begins in his conduct the good news is that according to the obama administration the rich will pay for everything the bad news is that according to the obama administration youre rich principles have no real force except when one is wellfed a conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who however has never learned how to walk forward if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal if you have always believed that everyone should play by the same rules and be judged by the same standards that would have gotten you labeled a radical 60 years ago a liberal 30 years ago and a racist today if the united states of america or britain is having elections they dont ask for observers from africa or from asia but when we have elections they want observers always vote for principle though you may vote alone and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost a fool and his money are soon elected in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican i have no ambition to govern men it is a painful and thankless office politics have no relation to morals those who stand for nothing fall for anything perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all the democrats are the party that says government will make you smarter taller richer and remove the crabgrass on your lawn the republicans are the party that says government doesnt work and then they get elected and prove it inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man my brother bob doesnt want to be in government  he promised dad hed go straight the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis politics has become so expensive that it takes a lot of money even to be defeated life without liberty is like a body without spirit politicians also have no leisure because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself power and glory or happiness i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts a free america means just this individual freedom for all rich or poor or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it only government can take perfectly good paper cover it with perfectly good ink and make the combination worthless hell i never vote for anybody i always vote against a healthy democracy requires a decent society it requires that we are honorable generous tolerant and respectful i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them a leader in the democratic party is a boss in the republican party he is a leader politics a strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles the conduct of public affairs for private advantage there aint no answer there aint gonna be any answer there never has been an answer thats the answer conservatism has had from its inception vigorously positive intellectually rigorous agenda and thinking that agenda should have in my three pillars strengthen the economy strengthen our security and strengthen our families conservative n a statesman who is enamored of existing evils as distinguished from the liberal who wishes to replace them with others whenever men take the law into their own hands the loser is the law and when the law loses freedom languishes we would all like to vote for the best man but he is never a candidate when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle ninety percent of the politicians give the other ten percent a bad reputation a liberal is a man or a woman or a child who looks forward to a better day a more tranquil night and a bright infinite future any american who is prepared to run for president should automatically by definition be disqualified from ever doing so bad politicians are sent to washington by good people who dont vote we hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office i love power but it is as an artist that i love it i love it as a musician loves his violin to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies in politics the middle way is none at all you want a friend in washington get a dog the successful revolutionary is a statesman the unsuccessful one a criminal conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives instead of giving a politician the keys to the city it might be better to change the locks tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes our ancestors it is the democracy of the dead tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around there are many men of principle in both parties in america but there is no party of principle all the president is is a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering kissing and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway a diplomat is a person who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that you actually look forward to the trip the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death when buying and selling are controlled by legislation the first things to be bought and sold are legislators he who knows how to flatter also knows how to slander i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue apparently a democracy is a place where numerous elections are held at great cost without issues and with interchangeable candidates politics it seems to me for years or all too long has been concerned with right or left instead of right or wrong half of the american people have never read a newspaper half never voted for president one hopes it is the same half radical changes in world politics leave america with a heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a genuinely free democratic just and humane society hell hath no fury like a bureaucrat scorned an idea not coupled with action will never get any bigger than the brain cell it occupied power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely republicans are men of narrow vision who are afraid of the future pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting we allow them to disperse because weve been ignorant of their value it is not in the nature of politics that the best men should be elected the best men do not want to govern their fellowmen oh that lovely title expresident democracy is being allowed to vote for the candidate you dislike least a liberal is a man who is willing to spend somebody elses money one of the reasons people hate politics is that truth is rarely a politicians objective election and power are republicans have nothing but bad ideas and democrats have no ideas in politics nothing is contemptible in most places in the country voting is looked upon as a right and a duty but in chicago its a sport if we desire respect for the law we must first make the law respectable i know many writers who first dictate passages then polish what they have dictated i speak then i polish  occasionally i do windows when i was a boy i was told that anybody could become president im beginning to believe it americas present need is not heroics but healing not nostrums but normalcy not revolution but restoration the activist is not the man who says the river is dirty the activist is the man who cleans up the river our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control mens minds for every talent that poverty has stimulated it has blighted a hundred you may think the president is allpowerful but he is not he needs a lot of guidance from the lord politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable you cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt liberalism is i think resurgent one reason is that more and more people are so painfully aware of the alternative in order to become the master the politician poses as the servant when one may pay out over two million dollars to presidential and congressional campaigns the us government is virtually up for sale a conservative is a man who just sits and thinks mostly sits the end move in politics is always to pick up a gun do you ever get the feeling that the only reason we have elections is to find out if the polls were right i have long enjoyed the friendship and companionship of republicans because i am by instinct a teacher and i would like to teach them something every man who repeats the dogma of mill that one country is no fit to rule another country must admit that one class is not fit to rule another class if nominated i will not run if elected i will not serve the idea that you can merchandise candidates for high office like breakfast cereal  that you can gather votes like box tops  is i think the ultimate indignity to the democratic process liberalism is trust of the people tempered by prudence conservatism is distrust of the people tempered by fear a politician will do anything to keep his job  even become a patriot if you dont like the president it costs you 90 bucks to fly to washington to picket if you dont like the governor it costs you 60 bucks to fly to albany to picket if you dont like me 90 cents the secret of getting things done is to act a conservative is someone who makes no changes and consults his grandmother when in doubt democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one the only difference between the democrats and the republicans is that the democrats allow the poor to be corrupt too free speech is not to be regulated like diseased cattle and impure butter the audience that hissed yesterday may applaud today even for the same performance as you make your bed so you must lie in it i think its a terrible shame that politics has become show business i have a fantasy where ted turner is elected president but refuses because he doesnt want to give up power vote for the man who promises least hell be the least disappointing politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed no real social change has ever been brought about without a revolution revolution is but thought carried into action politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians a war for a great principle ennobles a nation the revolution is a dictatorship of the exploited against the exploiters turn on to politics or politics will turn on you every politician should have been born an orphan and remain a bachelor many politicians are in the habit of laying it down as a selfevident proposition that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom the maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim the flood of money that gushes into politics today is a pollution of democracy freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be the revenues of cuban staterun companies are used exclusively for the benefit of the people to whom they belong reporters thrive on the worlds misfortune for this reason they often take an indecent pleasure in events that dismay the rest of humanity the world is governed by opinion the beef industry has contributed to more american deaths than all the wars of this century all natural disasters and all automobile accidents combined a conservative is one who admires radicals centuries after theyre dead the most important political office is that of the private citizen in politics it is necessary either to betray ones country or the electorate i prefer to betray the electorate i do have a political agenda its to have as few regulations as possible the thing i enjoyed most were visits from children they did not want public office justice sir is the great interest of man on earth it is the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations together it is a measure of the framers fear that a passing majority might find it expedient to compromise 4th amendment values that these values were embodied in the constitution itself if you are going to sin sin against god not the bureaucracy god will forgive you but the bureaucracy wont conservatives define themselves in terms of what they oppose i should prefer to have a politician who regularly went to a massage parlour than one who promised a laptop computer for every teacher the largest party in america by the way is neither the democrats nor the republicans its the party of nonvoters in politics what begins in fear usually ends in failure i can remember when democrats believed that it was the duty of america to fight for freedom over tyranny you have not converted a man because you have silenced him the first resistance to social change is to say its not necessary the vicepresidency is sort of like the last cookie on the plate everybody insists he wont take it but somebody always does voters dont decide issues they decide who will decide issues the world will never have lasting peace so long as men reserve for war the finest human qualities peace no less than war requires idealism and selfsacrifice and a righteous and dynamic faith the politicians were talking themselves red white and blue in the face when they see me holding fish they can see that i am comfortable with kings as well as with paupers the united states brags about its political system but the president says one thing during the election something else when he takes office something else at midterm and something else when he leaves ive been to war and its not easy to kill its bloody and messy and totally horrifying and the consequences are serious my hope is that 10 years from now after ive been across the street at work for a while theyll all be glad they gave me that wonderful vote it is difficult to discern a serious threat to religious liberty from a room of silent thoughtful schoolchildren sensible and responsible women do not want to vote the relative positions to be assumed by man and woman in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence than ours he too serves a certain purpose who only stands and cheers the more i see of the representatives of the people the more i admire my dogs so long as we have enough people in this country willing to fight for their rights well be called a democracy confronted with the choice the american people would choose the policemans truncheon over the anarchists bomb they say women talk too much if you have worked in congress you know that the filibuster was invented by men when governments become large voters cannot exercise close oversight otherwise known as political power voting is a civic sacrament in a democracy dissent is an act of faith i was a woman in a mans world i was a democrat in a republican administration i was an intellectual in a world of bureaucrats i talked differently this may have made me a bit like an ink blot their very conservatism is secondhand and they dont know what they are conserving when the body of the people is possessed of the supreme power it is called a democracy your every voter as surely as your chief magistrate exercises a public trust it is our experience that political leaders do not always mean the opposite of what they say and after i make a lot of money ill be able to afford running for office i always voted at my partys call and i never thought of thinking for myself at all i cant let important policy decisions hinge on the fact that an election is coming up every 90 days what politicians want to create is irreversible change because when you leave office someone changes it back again we have i fear confused power with greatness frankly i dont mind not being president i just mind that someone else is i think there is one higher office than president and i would call that patriot if a politician murders his mother the first response of the press or of his opponents will likely be not that it was a terrible thing to do but rather that in a statement made six years before he had gone on record as being opposed to matricide we live in a world in which politics has replaced philosophy you better take advantage of the good cigars you dont get much else in that job after much prayerful consideration i feel that i must say i have climbed my last political mountain our party is a diverse one as is my home state of illinois you know they say the most dangerous person of the world is a member of the united states congress just home from a threeday factfinding trip it has been well said that a hungry man is more interested in four sandwiches than four freedoms television is democracy at its ugliest i never considered a difference of opinion in politics in religion in philosophy as cause for withdrawing from a friend politics is the art of looking for trouble finding it everywhere diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies politics is for the present but an equation is for eternity it has been said that politics is the second oldest profession i have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again what i have done since then is pretty well known politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow next week next month and next year and to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didnt happen politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous in war you can only be killed once but in politics many times in war you can only be killed once but in politics many times i am never going to have anything more to do with politics or politicians when this war is over i shall confine myself entirely to writing and painting politics are very much like war we may even have to use poison gas at times those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is in politics nothing happens by accident if it happens you can bet it was planned that way politics is such a torment that i advise everyone i love not to mix with it sometimes i wonder if we shall ever grow up in our politics and say definite things which mean something or whether we shall always go on using generalities to which everyone can subscribe and which mean very little politics i supposed to be the secondoldest profession i have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first politics is not a bad profession if you succeed there are many rewards if you disgrace yourself you can always write a book politics is just like show business you have a hell of an opening coast for a while and then have a hell of a close a typical vice of american politics is the avoidance of saying anything real on real issues politics is like football if you see daylight go through the hole im always rather nervous about how you talk about women who are active in politics whether they want to be talked about as women or as politicians therefore the good of man must be the end of the science of politics politics is the art of controlling your environment in the end thats what this election is about do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope poetry is about the grief politics is about the grievance the more you observe politics the more youve got to admit that each party is worse than the other in politics stupidity is not a handicap what englishman will give his mind to politics as long as he can afford to keep a motor car i must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy the most practical kind of politics is the politics of decency the first lesson of economics is scarcity there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it the first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics if you ever injected truth into politics you have no politics before i went to jail i was active in politics as a member of south africas leading organization  and i was generally busy from 7 am until midnight i never had time to sit and think in our age there is no such thing as keeping out of politics all issues are political issues and politics itself is a mass of lies evasions folly hatred and schizophrenia there is no more independence in politics than there is in jail there is probably a perverse pride in my administration that we were going to do the right thing even if shortterm it was unpopular and i think anybody whos occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you cant be neglecting of marketing and pr and public opinion like religion politics and family planning cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public its too controversial the trouble with nixon is that hes a serious politics junkie hes totally hooked and like any other junkie hes a bummer to have around especially as president part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because were hardwired not to always think clearly when were scared and the countrys scared after you have exhausted what there is in business politics conviviality and so on  have found that none of these finally satisfy or permanently wear  what remains nature remains politics is applesauce few businessmen are capable of being in politics they dont understand the democratic process they have neither the tolerance or the depth it takes democracy isnt a business politics doesnt make strange bedfellows  marriage does i hate all politics i dont like either political party one should not belong to them  one should be an individual standing in the middle anyone that belongs to a party stops thinking freedom isnt free it shouldnt be a bragging point that oh i dont get involved in politics as if that makes someone cleaner no that makes you derelict of duty in a republic liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didnt insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable the most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own the central conservative truth is that it is culture not politics that determines the success of a society the central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself these things will destroy the human race politics without principle progress without compassion wealth without work learning without silence religion without fearlessness and worship without awareness politics ought to be the parttime profession of every citizen who would protect the rights and privileges of free people and who would preserve what is good and fruitful in our national heritage i am in politics because of the conflict between good and evil and i believe that in the end good will triumph there are still people in my party who believe in consensus politics i regard them as quislings as traitors i mean it politics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is thought necessary the country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy we have to offer an alternative vision to err is human to blame someone else is politics one of the things being in politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned or reasonable sex in politics never retreat never retract never admit a mistake politics is the entertainment branch of industry i havent been very active in politics i think that you can disagree with people and debate over their positions with issues without engaging in the politics of personal destruction it is a vain hope to make people happy by politics anyone who thinks that the vicepresident can take a position independent of the president of his administration simply has no knowledge of politics or government you are his choice in a political marriage and he expects your absolute loyalty at the bottom of education at the bottom of politics even at the bottom of religion there must be for our race economic independence in politics as in religion it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution we need more of the office desk and less of the show window in politics let men in office substitute the midnight oil for the limelight one of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace good people dont go into government alliance  in international politics the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each others pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third i dont think politics has anything to do with left right or center it has to do with trying to do right by people revolution n in politics an abrupt change in the form of misgovernment i learnt more about politics during one south dakota dust storm than in seven years at the university we believe that to err is human to blame it on someone else is politics i must not write a word to you about politics because you are a woman if everybody in this town connected with politics had to leave town because of chasing women and drinking you would have no government im not an old experienced hand at politics but i am now seasoned enough to have learned that the hardest thing about any political campaign is how to win without proving that you are unworthy of winning the challenge is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible in every country today there is politics it may be authoritarian politics but there is politics i was in civil society long before i was ever in politics or my husband was ever even elected president there is no act of treachery or meanness of which a political party is not capable for in politics there is no honour if you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics  a creed from which you yourself cannot expect to draw any material advantage  surely that proves that you are in the right i am an anglocatholic in religion a classicist in literature and a royalist in politics what is a wife and what is a harlot what is a church and what is a theatre are they two and not one can they exist separate are not religion and politics the same thing brotherhood is religion o demonstrations of reason dividing families in cruelty and pride when you are in any contest you should work as if there were  to the very last minute  a chance to lose it this is battle this is politics this is anything half a truth is better than no politics consul  in american politics a person who having failed to secure an office from the people is given one by the administration on condition that he leave the country politics is a profession a serious complicated and in its true sense a noble one establishing lasting peace is the work of education all politics can do is keep us out of war politics will eventually be replaced by imagery the politician will be only too happy to abdicate in favor of his image because the image will be much more powerful than he could ever be office politics are bloodyminded but weak on content politics is an act of faith you have to show some kind of confidence in the intellectual and moral capacity of the public my objection to liberalism is this that it is the introduction into the practical business of life of the highest kind namely politics of philosophical ideas instead of political principles politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom and a great empire and little minds go ill together there are no morals in politics there is only expedience a scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel war has rules mud wrestling has rules  politics has no rules only very intelligent people dont wish they were in politics and im dumb enough to want to be in there compromise makes a good umbrella but a poor roof it is temporary expedient often wise in party politics almost sure to be unwise in statesmanship finality is not the language of politics real politics are the possession and distribution of power politics is a science you can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong in politics shared hatreds are almost always the basis of friendships politics begin where the masses are not where there are thousands but where there are millions that is where serious politics begin there is no gambling like politics king louis philippe once said to me that he attributed the great success of the british nation in political life to their talking politics after dinner the practice of politics in the east may be defined by one word dissimulation to rely upon conviction devotion and other excellent spiritual qualities that is not to be taken seriously in politics i think one of the great problems we have in the republican party is that we dont encourage you to be nasty we encourage you to be neat obedient loyal and faithful and all those boy scout words which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics ideology politics and journalism which luxuriate in failure are impotent in the face of hope and joy fiscal conservatism is just an easy way to express something that is a bit more difficult which is that the size and scope of government and really the size and scope of politics in our lives has grown uncomfortable unwieldy intrusive and inefficient the world of american politics is more contentious than it has ever been in my lifetime to those who have exhausted politics nothing remains but abstract thought a politics that is not sensitive to the concerns and circumstances of peoples lives a politics that does not speak to and include people is an intellectually arrogant politics that deserves to fail when times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain the politics of constant conflict may be good but what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world what works in the real world is cooperation war should be the politics of last resort and when we go to war we should have a purpose that our people understand and support you begin saving the world by saving one man at a time all else is grandiose romanticism or politics when we are sick we want an uncommon doctor when we have a construction job to do we want an uncommon engineer and when we are at war we want an uncommon general it is only when we get into politics that we are satisfied with the common man forget sex or politics or religion loneliness is the subject that clears out a room by 2000 politics will simply fade away we will not see any political parties politics is the diversion of trivial men who when they succeed at it become important in the eyes of more trivial men politics are for foreigners with their endless wrongs and paltry rights politics are a lousy way to get things done politics are like gods infinite mercy a last resort politics is not bean bags its serious tough stuff you cant be in politics unless you can walk in a room and know in a minute whos for you and whos against you just because you do not take an interest in politics doesnt mean politics wont take an interest in you first i think more americans need to declare their independence from partisan politics on both sides the more that americans declare their independence the more the parties will have to compete for their votes using reason rather than the hateful appeals university politics are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small nothing is so admirable in politics as a short memory if youre sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and principles come and join this campaign i guess youd call me an independent since ive never identified myself with one party or another in politics i always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as i can at the actual candidates and issues themselves no matter what the party label i have no consistency except in politics and that probably arises from my indifference to the subject altogether from politics it was an easy step to silence i have come to the conclusion that politics are too serious a matter to be left to the politicians as a black woman my politics and political affiliation are bound up with and flow from participation in my peoples struggle for liberation and with the fight of oppressed people all over the world against american imperialism weve switched from a culture that was interested in manufacturing economics politics  trying to play a serious part in the world  to a culture thats really entertainmentbased the sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world politics isnt about big money or power games its about the improvement of peoples lives there is no sea more dangerous than the ocean of practical politics none in which there is more need of good pilotage and of a single unfaltering purpose when the waves rise high i think politicians get hamstrung by the nature of politics when the private sector can really do great things politics is not the art of the possible it consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable there are times in politics when you must be on the right side and lose in politics strangely enough the best way to play your cards is to lay them face upwards on the table politics in a literary work is like a gun shot in the middle of a concert something vulgar and however something which is impossible to ignore a lot of women these days a lot of young women dont want to call themselves feminists you have this cheap hideous girl power sort of fad which i think is pretty benign at best but at worst i think its a way of taking the politics out of feminism and making it some kind of fashion politics as the word is commonly understood are nothing but corruptions politics would be a helluva good business if it werent for the goddamned people politics are not the task of a christian the advantage of the internet is that it has taken away the charade of politics china has heard of democracy and people know about certain concepts they wouldnt have previously i played by the rules of politics as i found them in pakistan politics is hereditary there are no true friends in politics we are all sharks circling and waiting for traces of blood to appear in the water its like being at the kids table at thanksgiving  you can put your elbows on it you dont have to talk politics no matter how old i get theres always a part of me thats sitting there i reject the cynical view that politics is a dirty business what we won when all of our people united must not be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics accordingly i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as president one lesson you better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never go out on a golf course and beat the president in religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed than for those who deny the whole of it politics i conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself finishing second in the olympics gets you silver finishing second in politics gets you oblivion i seldom think of politics more than eighteen hours a day its really very simple governor when people are hungry they die so spare me your politics and tell me what you need and how youre going to get it to these people i think that people are tired theyre tired of the same old kind of politics people want a new tone to politics first rule of politics you cant win unless youre on the ballot second rule if you run you may lose and if you tie you do not win politics is human beings its addition rather than subtraction in politics every day is filled with numerous opportunities for serious error enjoy it politics is too partisan and sometimes patriotism is cast aside patriotism is honor and love of your country and your brothers and sisters with politics i get the impression that its all about whats good for the party and not necessarily whats good for the country i dont think consensusbuilding politics is what im meant to be doing the advice ive been giving to people all my life  that you may not be interested in the dialectic but the dialectic is interested in you you cant give up politics it wont give you up  was the advice i should have been taking myself the term the american left is as near to being meaningless or nonsensical as any term could really be in politics it isnt really a force in politics anymore and it would do well to ask itself why that is war is the ultimate tool of politics ive always said that an art critic can put aside politics around art politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business i hate politics its slimy any job where people pander for votes i dont like the country has gotten so partisan that if youre not on my side youre the enemy the only thing i ever try to support is a third party like unity08 we need more parties and more choice we need leadership we dont need a doubling down on the failed politics of the past to my great disappointment it appears that the politics of division are making a big comeback many americans share my disappointment  especially those who were filled with great hope a few years ago when thensenator obama announced his candidacy in springfield illinois where there is politics or economics there is no morality i tend to avoid televisions politics and places with velvet ropes a promising young man should go into politics so that he can go on promising for the rest of his life a wise nation should cultivate a political spirit that allows opponents to cooperate without fearing an automatic execution from their core supporters who knew that the real rogues in american politics would be the ones who dare to get along it is easier for women to succeed in business the arts and politics in america than in europe the new freedom of expression brought by the internet goes far beyond politics people relate to each other in new ways posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception and yet there are still people in american politics who for some reason cling to this belief that america is better off adopting the economic policies of nations whose people who immigrate here from there in politics merit is rewarded by the possessor being raised like a target to a position to be fired at my dream of politics all my life has been that it is the common business that it is something we owe to each other to understand and discuss with absolute frankness the democracy gap in our politics and elections spells a deep sense of powerlessness by people who drop out do not vote or listlessly vote for the least worst every four years and then wonder why after every cycle the least worst gets worse they said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics to take on publicsector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy but with bipartisan leadership we saved taxpayers 132 billion dollars over 30 years and saved retirees their pensions we did it nobody likes you know the ugly parts of politics at present our country needs womens idealism and determination perhaps more in politics than anywhere else politics and war are remarkably similar situations no cause is left but the most ancient of all the one in fact that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics the cause of freedom versus tyranny africanamericans who might have disagreed with candidate obamas leftofcenter politics voted for him in 2008 because electing a candidate with brown skin was too historic an opportunity to miss adherents of the new religious right reject the separation of politics and religion but they bring no spiritual insights to politics i voted for barack because he was black cuz thats why other folks vote for other people  because they look like them thats american politics pure and simple i dont think you can work on feelings in politics apart from anything else political change can come very unexpectedly sometimes overnight when you least expect it i dont really like labels in politics but i will gladly accept the label of conservatism the secret of politics make a good treaty with russia a couple of weeks is a long time in american politics i dont know why that is but english politics is just so overly white its very much about the class structure its an honor putting art above politics politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul i detest politics to be honest with you its a cesspool and i dont think i would fare well in that cesspool because i dont believe in political correctness and i certainly dont believe in dishonesty the enemy is not just terrorism it is the threat posed specifically by islamist terrorism by bin ladin and others who draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within a minority strain of islam that does not distinguish politics from religion and distorts both i think that what went wrong with religion is the same thing that went wrong with politics is that it became too money based and too controlling its just a weakness that we human beings have for control  we want one thing and then we want more and then we want more you do the policy ill do the politics life is a corrupting process from the time a child learns to play his mother off against his father in the politics of when to go to bed he who fears corruption fears life it is impossible to practice parliamentary politics without having patience decency politeness and courtesy a dose of humility goes a long way in life and in politics war is not the continuation of politics with different means it is the greatest masscrime perpetrated on the community of man an independent is someone who wants to take the politics out of politics we mean by politics the peoples business  the most important business there is politics disgusts me i never thought of politics as a profession i have never regarded politics as the arena of morals it is the arena of interest ive rarely kept my distance from kind of  i dont know if we can call it politics but kind of civic engagement and that kind of thing except i tended to think well do it yourself before you start telling other people what they should be doing remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band you wore their shirt and sang every word you didnt know anything about scene politics haircuts or what was cool all you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with someone finally understood you this is what music is about i am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature not that i understand what these terms mean but i take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist is there in all the history of human folly a greater fool than a clergymen in politics anythings possible in politics you have to take away some of tax breaks for the wealthy and you have to cut back on some entitlements because unless we do all of these things it just doesnt work and whats good theater and whats good politics isnt necessarily good economic policy the hope of a new politics does not lie in formulating a leftwing reply to the rightit lies in rejecting conventional political categories everybody in america is soft and hates conflict the cure for this both in politics and social life is the same  hardihood give them raw truth democrats always like to brag that their guys are smarter than the opponents and republicans always like to brag that their guys are more moral than the opponents but if youre looking for morals in politics youre looking for bananas in the cheese department in politics women type the letters lick the stamps distribute the pamphlets and get out the vote men get elected never believe anything in politics until it has been officially denied i know im not supposed to have any opinions about politics because im famous politics is organized hatred that is unity finance is a gun politics is knowing when to pull the trigger well judy i would hope in the new year we could start thinking about politics not like it was the super bowl where you always have to have one team that wins and the other team has to be a loser youve got to watch the politics of aids the politics of aids can work both for and against the victims of aids everything is politics i think whats fascinating is how many people are playing in politics who maybe havent played before war is the continuation of politics by other means its a big deal for me to say im over politics because politics rests on an irreducible measure of coercion it can never become a perfect realm of perfect love and justice the first requirement of politics is not intellect or stamina but patience politics is a very long run game and the tortoise will usually beat the hare i think politics is important its how we run our society i think it should be natural to have an interest in the subject and i almost dont understand why some people dont heres a very good rule of thumb in politics losing begets losing this has always been the way of presidential politics the president rises above the fray while his surrogates go on the attack they throw the spears and fling the mud he sits upon the throne obama seemed poised to realign american politics after his stunning 2008 victory but the economy remains worse than even the administrations worstcase scenarios and the long legislative battles over health care reform financial services reform and the national debt and deficit have taken their toll obama no longer looks invincible many individuals are doing what they can but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics when i became leader i made very clear i was not going to choose the easy life i have always taken risks i dont like comfortzone politics politics is just show business for ugly people you cant ignore politics no matter how much youd like to there is in fact no such thing as art for arts sake art that stands above classes art that is detached from or independent of politics proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed i honestly believe that theres an element in this country in our politics that does not want to see a businessman succeed at getting the nomination for the republican party and does not want me to succeed at becoming president of the united states of america one of the things that i think you see sometimes in politics is a certain degree of caution its usually advised by consultants who dont want to see you march to the end of a limb we discussed politics but we also talked about the importance of hard work personal responsibility living within your means keeping your word those lessons stay with you throughout your life the world of politics is always twenty years behind the world of thought i think that politics could be a positive thing my beef is that people focus on the personal aspect of a politician too much they should focus on the results no science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power im not a politician and dont want any part of politics our politics are our deepest form of expression they mirror our past experiences and reflect our dreams and aspirations for the future politics is about the improvement of peoples lives its about advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and the world politics is about doing well for the people politics is the art of the possible creativity is the art of the impossible politics is repetition it is not change change is something beyond what we call politics change is the essence politics is supposed to be the means to bring into being i think politics come out of psychology the politics of partisanship and the resulting inaction and excuses have paralyzed decisionmaking primarily at the federal level and the big issues of the day are not being addressed leaving our future in jeopardy and you dont want to always write about politics just for the sake of writing about politics the message that i gave on the  on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual believe in the power of one person dont believe that you cant do it everybody wants  everybody wants a shot that we can all agree on beyond that it becomes politics im not talking politics i dont fancy myself a political commentator i hate politics i hate it in government you carry each hope each disillusion and in politics its always about the next challenge you know the media and politicians are always gonna be in a bit of tension with one another and probably most of the time thats healthy and indeed even creative but its where  its really when news organisations are used as kind of instruments of politics that it gets tricky i never have been involved in politics i believe in the separation of church and state but i do not believe in the separation of politics from religion you cannot mix sports with politics the world we build tomorrow is born in the stories we tell our children today politics moves the pieces education changes the game i dont follow politics much if acknowledging that racial misgivings and misunderstandings are still a part of politics and life in america i plead guilty by nominating chuck hagel to be his defense secretary president obama is putting forward an aloof contrarian who doesnt suffer fools  a striving politician who considers himself above politics ive been leading newsrooms for a while now and its been an honor serving as editor in chief of nj but i really think that my best shot at moving the needle in politics is by getting close to it  by reading reporting tweeting and writing politics exist in the boardroom as well politics is the womb in which war develops i think things changed as a result of a certain perception of our politics when we went through our zealous selfrighteous period it didnt exactly win us any friends politics is not really my thing flipping the dial through available radio stations there will blare out to any listener an array of broadcasts 247 propagating religious right politics along with what they deem to be oldtime gospel preaching this is especially true of what comes over the airwaves in bible belt southern states when times are tough constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world cooperation works better after all nobodys right all the time and a broken clock is right twice a day politics is the conspiracy of the unproductive but organized against the productive but unorganized in politics people give you what they think you deserve and deny you what they think you want these days politics religion media seem to get all mixed up television became the new religion a long time back and the media has taken over politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the right reason is to challenge the status quo to serve the common good and to leave this nation better than we found it every two years the american politics industry fills the airwaves with the most virulent scurrilous walltowall character assassination of nearly every political practitioner in the country  and then declares itself puzzled that america has lost trust in its politicians as women have played an increasingly important role in politics there is no question that theyve brought a different perspective focusing attention on a broader set of issues and building alliances with other women it isnt fate but fecklessness that has shoved sarah palin to the sidelines of national politics the real tragedy is that shes taken a lot of other serious republican women with her when i first started working in politics as a junior aide on walter mondales 1984 presidential campaign it never occurred to me that i would one day work in the white house there were plenty of women among the volunteers who stuffed envelopes and walked precincts but there were fewer and fewer on each successive level of influence and access after i left the white house i kept a foothold in the business of american politics as a talkshow host analyst commentator speechmaker and occasional writer i was no longer a practitioner but i was still a partisan a democrat a bluestater through and through im not in politics after all is said that can be said upon the liquor traffic its influence is degrading upon the individual the family politics and business and upon everything that you touch in this old world ferdinand was a gold trader he was a lawyer for mining companies when he entered politics in l949 he had tons and tons of gold when bill gates was a college dropout ferdinand already possessed billions of dollars and tons of gold it wasnt stolen there are few things in politics more annoying than the rights utter conviction that it owns the patent on the word freedom that when its leaders stand up for the rights of banks to be unregulated or capital gains to be untaxed that it is actually and obviously standing up for human liberty the noblest cause of them all this aesthetic quality then is what politics is all about its authenticity that separates winners from losers good politics from bad and heman leadertypes from consultantdirected puppetboys acknowledging class was always difficult for new democrats  it was secondwave it was divisive  but 2008 made retro politics cool again i like to see myself as a bridge builder that is me building bridges between people between races between cultures between politics trying to find common ground i do not believe that artists or actors and people should be out there like voicing their fullblown opinions on politics because lets face it at the end of the day im not that smart of a guy i can tell you that too much money is corrupting american politics dont blame the american public the us supreme court has a lot to answer for because it has made it impossible for congress to reduce the corrupting influence of money on american political life i think in politics in congress you often do things that are republican or you do things because youre a democrat sometimes thats good obviously and sometimes thats obviously bad but in the news business theres no such thing as republican or democratic news news is news im looking forward to the day when america will mature to the point that we are a colorblind society im not so sure that in politics that will ever be reality because politics has a way of separating us based on skin color when a cabinet minister who is sacked for telling lies is reappointed in the face of every constitutional convention only for the same man to be sacked again from the same cabinet for the same offence by the same prime minister no wonder the public are cynical about politics politics is the only field in which the more experience you have the worse you get in politics an organized minority is a political majority everyone wants to demagogue everyone else that may be good politics but its awful policy i dont compromise my principles for politics i came back from university thinking i knew all about politics and racism not knowing my dad had been one of the youngestserving labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in south africa years ago because of the situation there and hes never mentioned it  you just find out thats a real man to me a sleeping lion i am a sportsman and not a politician i am a sportsman and will always remain one i am not going to enter politics giving up cricket which is my life i will continue to play cricket without alienation there can be no politics it would be great if politics were factbased but it is not and it is surely not nuancebased what works in a classroom or a think tank does not work on capitol hill or in the white house obama sometimes seems to be running the brookings institution not the country while we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith our politics and our culture are in the main less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly christian character than they were even five years ago i think this is a good thing  good for our political culture once the cry and the cause of a generation of progressives to make america safer fairer and cleaner regulation is now a dirty word in our politics even democrats are quick to talk about cutting regulations republicans hate them with  how to put it  evangelical fervor whether one believes or not religion is as real a force in the life of the world as economics or politics and it demands fairminded attention even if you think the entire religious enterprise is at best misguided and at worst counterproductive it remains vital inspiring great good and sometimes great evil one thing i have frankly decided is that when it comes to political reform we have two conservative parties in british politics both the labour and conservative parties have constantly and repeatedly failed to honour promises they have made about reforming cleaning modernising our clappedout system i didnt come into politics to change the labour party i came into politics to change the country in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy least of all in politics which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight i mean i went to a church school when i was younger and imbibed a certain amount of religion then but it was really in university that i got interested in religion and politics at the same time i dont think as if it were one moment of conversion but my spiritual journey really began then amnesty is a terrible policy and its terrible politics its a terrible policy because you are rewarding people for breaking the law i have some very personal feelings about politics but i dont get into it because i do comedy already when applied to politics and taken to its extreme kitsch is the mask of death fascism was all aesthetics there was no core principle to it there was no truth to it and im not apolitical  im very specific in my politics but a lot of the time its nobodys business unless youre over at my house having dinner to work in architecture you are so much involved with society with politics with bureaucrats its a very complicated process to do large projects you start to see the society how it functions how it works then you have a lot of criticism about how it works i have never found in a long experience of politics that criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance war is not an independent phenomenon but the continuation of politics by different means with participation in politics so low at the moment i think christians should ensure their views are represented at all levels and not leave it to others telling the truth and confronting the challenge is what politics is about in politics yesterdays lie is attacked only to flatter todays what drew me to politics in the first place was the fact that i wanted to have a place to take a stand and use my voice to express what i believed in but ive no longer got any political aspirations i feel that as a politician fifty per cent of people would hate you before you even left the house my mother lillie specter was an angel and totally uninterested in politics pennsylvania is a very tough state people dont last long in pennsylvania politics the proper reply to right wing religiosity is not to insist that politics and religion dont mix this is the stock response of the left it is money money money not ideas not principles but money that reigns supreme in american politics the days when the words hollywood actor framed ronald reagan like bunny fingers as an id tag and an implied insult seem faroff and quaint nearly everybody in politics  candidate consultant pundit and tea party crowd extra alike  is an actor now a shameless ham in a hokedup reality series that never stops idealism is the despot of thought just as politics is the despot of will politics as a practice whatever its professions has always been the systematic organization of hatreds politics are a very unsatisfactory game practical politics consists in ignoring facts politics as a practise whatever its professions has always been the systematic organization of hatreds politics have always been the systematic organization of hatreds skip the religion and politics head straight to the compassion everything else is a distraction i believe people who go into politics want to do the right thing and then they hit a big wall of reelection and the pettiness of politics in the end politics gets in the way of the business of people the lesson of the last year is this foreign policy cant be managed through the politics of personality and our president would do well to take note of an observation john f kennedy made once he was in office  that all of the worlds problems arent his predecessors fault in politics there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers and then there are those like john mccain who use their careers to promote change im not the guy to ask about politics im a gag writer frankly if you do politics you should not be thinking about your dignity we read too much shakespeare at school and view our parliamentary politics as dynastic drama in which an impatient crown prince frets at his long subordination and begins to scheme for the throne he knows he merits was promised and has earned except for politics no business is scrutinized more exhaustively than journalism in politics the people i most despise are those who have no values i try not to spend too much time on partisan politics lifes too short for that i dont really believe that there have been many human problems solved by politics i got politics and economics moving and then others took over politics is a blood sport love is blind my politics has been too i think you can fall in love with ideas and you can fall in love with people its a very subjective experience and im loyal to that experience my shows arent about trying to save some place because i dont feel thats the right venue for it thats my politics right there dont bring politics to my shows you know im just not going to get into american politics i will say that i think israel enjoys strong bipartisan support in the united states its really above and beyond american politics its time to let science and medicine not politics and rhetoric lead us to good sound policy sometimes in politics you think youve seen it all turns out i was wrong a year is an eternity in politics  though less than a moment in history in politics you learn to always smile i do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals it is about ideas in the melting pot that is america inclusive trumps exclusive whether its single women young adults or minorities alienating the rapidly growing voting blocs is not smart politics i think president obama could have handled politics and policies differently but he has been decisive strong and consistent  important qualities in a president mitt romney is indeed an etch a sketch the antithesis of leadership why does it have to be politics is there a dynamism to that world and a theoretical capacity to do things that draws many talented people absolutely are there other ways to be involved and lead an interesting life of course yet it ought to be obvious that good music generally occupies a higher plane that mere politics great writers can express moods through melody and capture experiences we share most powerfully  love lust longing joy rage fear triumph yearning and confusion the science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past the record of truths revealed by experience is eminently practical as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future good policy makes good politics and what ive done has been good politics i never got into politics for it to be a career i never got into politics for it to be a career it doesnt take a lot of strength to hang on it takes a lot of strength to let go i guess probably in my time in politics it continued to be affirmed to me that the africanamerican community despite being subscription televisions most valuable customers they are very underserved by cable and satellite television programming options im not driven to get back into politics its not on my top five things to do before i die but saying that i may be in politics in the next year or the next ten years ive been on the front line for 12 years four in state government eight on the national level we need to remember that politics is all about people not programs we shouldnt want to take the humanness out of the political arena growing up in politics i know that women decide all elections because we do all the work politics is not an exact science most people dont want to talk about politics and religion they say lets talk about something else i dont believe your soul mate has to share your politics i dont like to talk about things where youre going to gt one side or the other unhappy my music has no politics those who write the editorials and those who write the columns they simply are unaccountable theyre free to impose their cultural politics in the name of freedom of the press its not that im universally loved we know im not in new jersey but what they do say in new jersey is we like him and we think hes telling us the truth i think we need to have that type of politics on the national level i want to stay away from politics or else ill probably end up putting my size fifteen foot into my mouth for a person who promised hope and civility in politics mr obama has shown a borderline obsessiveness in blaming mr bush you realize that for all the shenanigans that go on in the big circus of politics everybody wakes up and goes to work politics has less to do with where you live than where your heart is i was in elective politics for 24 years ive made four national races two for president two for vice president i have found there are other ways to serve and im enjoying them one of the big changes in politics has been because families individuals have felt worried insecure worried about the economy worried about their jobs worried about their kids futures actually the disconnect between the public and media discourse and peoples everyday concerns has become bigger not smaller we live in a stage of politics where legislators seem to regard the passage of laws as much more important than the results of their enforcement for too long we have focused on our differences  in our politics and backgrounds in our race and beliefs  rather than cherishing the unity and pride that binds us together you can study government and politics in school but the best way to really understand the process is to volunteer your time we are losing sight of civility in government and politics debate and dialogue is taking a back seat to the politics of destruction and anger and control dogma has replaced thoughtful discussion between people of differing views while everyone else is thinking about economics and politics executive salaries and the future of the euro do the opposite even if its hard invest in the spirit i dont like politics politics are about preserving relationships at the end of the day and it has nothing to do with the greater good for humanity its just all about business you can rule ignorance you can manipulate the illiterate you can do whatever you want when a people are uneducated so that goes in line with corrupt business and corrupt politics sincerity and competence is a strong combination in politics it is everything george clooneys ides of march could be the most underappreciated movie of the year in 20 years theyre gonna go back and say oh that was american politics in that time period i follow politics i love it and that movie is so authentic i grew up in politics and i used to work for the democratic party some of the fdas own scientists have charged that politics not science is behind the fdas actions community organizing is all about building grassroots support its about identifying the people around you with whom you can create a common passionate cause and its about ignoring the conventional wisdom of company politics and instead playing the game by very different rules i didnt know my dad  he moved out early and my moms politics were kind of hardscrabble she didnt think about democrats or republicans she thought about who made sense ive been both in my life no one out there is interested in who did what to whom in westminster politics the more that i know of politics the more it makes me realize that being a politician is largely useless in politics people build whole reputations off of getting one thing right first of all i think its odd that people who cover politics wouldnt have any political views i was looking for something like baseball where theres a lot of data and the competition was pretty low thats when i discovered politics i guess i dont like the people in politics very much to be blunt ive had an interest in politics since i was a little kid you dont go into politics unless you want to win i cry sometimes because im not 20 years younger and im not healthy but if i were i would even sacrifice my writing to enter politics i dont want to express my opinion about actual politics because if i do i have to be responsible for my decision i understand the process of politics and the game of television the precise point at which a tax deduction becomes a loophole or a tax incentive becomes a subsidy for special interests is one of the great mysteries of politics politics thrives on simple clean messages something that played to obamas advantage in 2008 stagnant unemployment and the loss of americas aaa rating are as simple and tough as they come this is the economy on obamas watch and theres no one left to blame like indiana jones i dont like snakes  though that might lead some to ask why im in politics a lot of men in politics suddenly woke up to the issue of women in politics when they realised hey there are votes in this i was in the commons recently and saw a young lady wearing a nice pair of shoes i said i liked them and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics its called political economy because it is has nothing to do with either politics or economy as long as i dont write about the government religion politics and other institutions i am free to print anything i think that politics needs a bit of spicing up its much easier to wear a chairman mao button and shake your fists in the air and all that then to actually read the communist manifesto and things like that and actually become involved in politics i deliberately did not read anything about the vietnam war because i felt the politics of the war eclipsed what happened to the veterans the politics were irrelevant to what this memorial was politics is the reflex of the business and industrial world there is no hope even that woman with her right to vote will ever purify politics i still love following and thinking about politics i enjoy recommending important journalism i read or see from other sources if american politics are too dirty for women to take part in theres something wrong with american politics there is too much at stake for us to surrender to the politics of polarization in general people feel more relaxed about participating in politics they arent frightened as they used to be in politics you also have to be cautiously optimistic we tend to think of politics as bad full of dirty tricks negative ads big campaigns but i am here to explore the original meaning of politics which is positive and has to do with balancing competing interests and looking for solutions im in politics im in government so nothing surprises me people go into politics because they want the affirmation and they want the applause if i werent doing the politics i wouldnt be doing my job very few people go into politics to be reviled once you start saying lets talk political my own politics my own aspirations it can become not just distracting in that it takes time but it can become confusing and frustrating and is this now a political agenda or a governmental agenda i didnt run for student council president i dont see myself in any way in elected office i love policy im not particularly fond of politics public life is regarded as the crown of a career and to young men it is the worthiest ambition politics is still the greatest and the most honorable adventure mixing humor and politics is something that works whatever your supposed politics are  left right  if you put it in a human connection most people will rise to the occasion and feel the human pain in a way that they might not if it was presented in a more conceptual way theres a tradition in british intellectual life of mocking any nonpolitical force that gets involved in politics especially within the sphere of the arts and the theatre its a good question because a movie isnt good or bad based on its politics its usually good or bad for other reasons though you might agree or disagree with its politics well you know what im 60 years old and ive been interested in politics since i was on my daddys knee during the 1948 election we were praying for truman i know a lot about politics lets just do what is right for the american people and those of us who are involved in politics and government know that our responsibility is to the american people that we have a responsibility to find our common ground to seek it and to find it if i cry its about the personal loss of a friend or something like that but when it comes to politics  no i dont cry its about time we make the wellbeing of our young people more important than ideology and politics as a country we benefit from investing in their future by investing in teen pregnancy prevention when i started cnn i made the decision to stay out of endorsing candidates and let the doers make up their own minds about politics that it wasnt going to come from me i dont know if anybody wants to mix their politics with their entertainment yes politics is war without bloodshed and war is an extension of those politics the ability of the 1 percent to buy politicians and regulators is nothing new in american politics  just as inequality has been a permanent part of our economic system this is true of virtually all political and economic systems im highly political i spend an awful lot of time in the us trying to influence decisionmakers but i dont feel in tune with british politics the problem of the middle east is poverty more than politics its not about division its not about politics my concern is how do we come together well purity  theres no purity in politics going into politics is something people have asked me about forever well theres nobody who has a more supportive husband than i do and he has a business that he runs and its his own business so he has work to do my kids have school to do i mean people have  there are other things in life besides politics well the role of money in politics is pretty corrupting right now you know rock stardom i have a hard time discussing that because i dont really accept it its not really that tangible whats really bizarre is how its used as a thing  you know hes the rock star of politics hes the rock star of quarterbacks  like its the greatest thing in the world i am a part of the political process whether the multinational forces are present or not politics is serving the people not chairs and positions politics is the art of the next best politics ruins the character politics is the art of the possible today i think the attitude is that governing is not necessarily good politics and the result is that its much more partisan and much more divided there can only be democracy when money is not allowed to be spent in politics but i dont need to use politics as a way of making money when i came into politics i always thought there was a possibility i would be killed if there is one eternal truth of politics it is that there are always a dozen good reasons for doing nothing im not into politics but i am committed to a cause ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the uk curriculum alongside science and maths  grounding abstract theory merging the practical with the academic i could have made a fortune in cheeseburgers but i finally chose politics one of the things thats great about new york is that it is not a oneindustry town it has education academia the service industry arts publishing theater politics fashion finance as well as moviemaking there are three critical ingredients to democratic renewal and progressive change in america good public policy grassroots organizing and electoral politics it is the belief that extremes and excesses of inequality must be reduced so that each person is free to fully develop his or her full potential this is why we take precious time out of our lives and give it to politics politics is not about money politics is not about power politics is not about winning for the sake of winning politics is not predictions and politics is not observations politics is what we do politics is what we do politics is what we create by what we work for by what we hope for and what we dare to imagine we can and must move us politics forward by means of committed participation if you really want to diminish a candidate depict him as the foil of his handler this is as old in american politics as politics itself look there ought to be politics in politics the fallback position in politics is if you dont know what you want to be about and if you dont know what your vision is go at somebody else negative politics have always been around ill never get out of politics i have friends in public office i have things that i want to do you cant go back in life i wont go back to the existence i had before of running a political consulting firm and signing up clients and advising campaigns in exactly that way i know enough about european politics to know youve got a lot of crazy people who make their way onto the ballot one thing i have learned in my time in politics is that if one of the parties is shameless the other party cannot afford to be spineless what is more comforting to the terrorists around the world the failure to pass the 911 legislation because we lacked a majority of the majority or putting aside partisan politics to enact tough new legislation with americas security foremost in mind i dont want to spend the rest of my life in politics when im finished with my term as governor im going back to the life thats waiting for me in the private sector politics is not my life i have a career in radio and another career in film im not a political person when i start to get into it it just upsets me i feel so powerless when it comes to politics so ive just decided to be nonpolitical and very very prosoldier politics is my hobby smut is my vocation in politics the number of women in the cabinet has fallen and if current poll trends continue and labour loses a number of marginal seats the number of female mps is likely to drop significantly the labour party has done more than any other to address gender inequalities through legislation and other means and to increase womens representation in politics which has led to recent increases in the number of female politicians for sure the obamania thats fast taking hold reflects an incredible thirst for change in global politics and dare i say a wave of optimism that things can be different we need to dig deep and give people a reason to be optimistic just as obama is doing in america because in the same way that outcome of the us elections will change the course of events there and around the world so too do politics here in britain being out and about talking to residents and representing their views is in my view as important to politics as the grandstanding that takes place in westminster economics politics and personalities are often inseparable unfortunately the global warming hysteria as i see it is driven by politics more than by science politics is show business for ugly people religion has to stay in the heart not in politics it is private im not going to talk like i know about politics because im a total amateur but maybe i can be a spokesperson for people who arent normally interested in politics but im not interested in politics i lose interest the microsecond it ceases to be emotional when something becomes a political movement what im interested in is emotions politics is a highly tribal business you have a political and media elite who have an idiom by which they describe politics its highly highly polarised its right left red blue up down victorious crushed i didnt become leader to transform the liberal democrats into an enlarged form of the electoral reform society its not the be all and end all for us there are other very very key ambitions in politics not least social mobility and life chances that i care about as passionately if not more i have got instincts that i think are very much in tune with peoples very keen sense to see something different i did not dream of being in politics since i was kneehigh to a grasshopper i was not involved in student politics or not in that partisan way what i hope is in five years time i can go to the british people in the election and say lots of you doubted that coalition politics worked but it has worked the british political system and the whole clapped out westminster architecture and the language that we use about politics its completely unsustainable you either decide to be part of that transition to do something different or you cling to old certainties politics and power is a realm of relative influence i dont get involved in record label politics at the end of the day money is just a proxy for votes that is what makes politics so vulnerable to social media politics makes me sick i do not know much about politics but i am trying to do the best i can with this administration until the time shall come for me to turn it over to somebody else i try not to tune in to politics until its two or three months before the election till then its like watching preseason football i dont feel finally that my politics are entirely determined by the fact that im a gay man artists know that diligence counts as much if not more as inspiration in art as in politics patience counts as much as revolution no matter where i go  london beirut jerusalem washington beijing or bangalore  im always looking to rediscover that land of ten thousand lakes where politics actually worked to make peoples lives better not pull them apart people who build family businesses are not classically trained they have to deal with an enormous amount of politics you think corporate politics are tough go work for your dad or your mom human nature doesnt include all human beings there are human beings who are indifferent to politics religion virtually anything to balance china the democracies will need new friends  and india with its fastgrowing economy youthful population and democratic politics seems the obvious candidate like art and politics gangsterism is a very important avenue of assimilation into society im an independent im a centrist a new generation is arriving that has grown up with a multiplicity of choice in every aspect of their lives and yet politics is the last place that they are told that they should be satisfied with a choice between brand a and brand b it doesnt fit the way they think it doesnt fit the way they live i dont miss politics the idea that religion and politics dont mix was invented by the devil to keep christians from running their own country people not just reporters are more interested in politics than in government so the actual issues wouldnt be something that interested them no one wants to hear my perspective on politics but i think honestly as you get older you get more interested in it would that the simple maxim that honesty is the best policy might be laid to heart that a sense of the true aim of life might elevate the tone of politics and trade till public and private honor become identical my passion for ideas is not matched with a passion for partisan or electoral politics pro football gave me a good sense of perspective to enter politics id already been booed cheered cut sold traded and hung in effigy there are a lot of grotesqueries in politics not the least of which is the fundraising side clinton and obama practice this politics known quaintly as the richard speck strategy if you cannot take on everyone in the room at once take them out of the room one at a time although as a sailor i despised politics  for i loved my sailors life and still love it today  conditions forced me to take up a definite attitude towards political problems please dont ask me any questions about the politics of 30 years ago in politics a capable ruler must be guided by circumstances conjectures and conjunctions its very personal in its politics very bitter and very negative somehow we cant live outside the politics of race theres something very deep in all of us that is taught to us when we are very very little which is the disrespect and fear of the other talk of citizenship today is often thin and tinny the word has a faintly oldfashioned feel to it when used in everyday conversation when evoked in national politics its usually accompanied by the shrill whine of a descending culturewar mortar sometimes when i listen to fellow progressives i wonder if the only lesson we took away from the 04 elections is that politics is a word game in almost every country there are elements of opinion which would welcome such a conclusion because they wish to return to the politics of the balance of power unrestricted and unregulated armaments international anarchy and preparation for war on the contrary the characteristic element of the present situation is that economic questions have finally and irrevocably invaded the domain of public life and politics but i think its quite clear in my work that my orientation isnt political or doesnt come out of modern politics you will find in politics that you are much exposed to the attribution of false motive never complain and never explain and humility in politics means accepting that one party doesnt have all the answers recognising that working in partnership is progress not treachery my college fitzwilliam was pretty good but unfashionable and i lived in digs so i was not part of the cloistered old college environment which frankly was a bit intimidating but i worked hard and settled in by exploring politics and girls i hate injustice and i cant help but speak against it but i dont want to get involved in politics i get asked a lot about getting into politics i say take a look at politics you tell me what seems appealing about that politics has become unbelievably and unfortunately way too much about how much money is involved rather than what kind of ideas are involved arkansas is a state where politics is retail well for me the prolife issue has been something ive been very passionate about since the 70s and i have been very involved in the prolife community since long before politics regardless of bill clintons politics or personal life he grew up in obscurity and was elected to the presidency  twice dont take that away from him because then you take it away from every other kid in america sitting out there in a school bus with a big dream local politics like everything else are not what they used to be but the fact is that our political system  like our physical existence  still breaks down along geographical lines i cant see why anyone would want to be in politics because you get so much criticism politics is a lot of serendipity youre in the right place and the right time and youve got the right message and it either connects for you or or it doesnt im not involved in the politics of religion but i love what the message is anyone who seeks to be involved in politics should join hands with america in the world of energy politics the sudden vanishing of the word coal is a remarkable and unprecedented event bloomberg is famously impatient with beltway politics and believes that to get anything done you need to work from the ground up im not really involved with politics im living in my cocoon with my classical music around on the one hand the financial projection is on the agenda  we will see if this problem can be resolved or not i think it is a right idea to stage a special summit which would deal with the question of priorities of european politics that is why everyone in politics and we do it must make sure that they do not depend on one single interest group a good compromise is one where everybody makes a contribution thus the focus on this main political goal must become more visible in eu politics and to achieve this we need a political impulse it must be clear what the priorities on the agenda are whoever decides to dedicate their life to politics knows that earning money isnt the top priority its such a beautiful sport with no politics involved no color no class only as a youngster can you play and as a pro can you win the game has kept me young involved and excited and for me to be up here with gems of baseball ive never worked in politics never been a member of an official committee or a political party were in an illusion about what our role is in world politics and foreign affairs and our policies are killing and destroying and doing a lot of things that we are not aware of music is what i must do business is what i need to do and politics is what i have to do i was really lucky that i came to puberty at a time when music and politics were completely intertwined of course there are regrets i shall regret always that i found my own authentic voice in politics i was too conservative too conventional too safe too often too defensive too reactive later too often on the back foot the sight of allegedly sophisticated politicians parroting complete tripe trivialises and demeans government and it has to be stopped its played a significant part in public disillusionment with politics and has led to the absurd situation where more people vote for strictly come dancing than voted in the general election yeah exactly you can talk about politics in music you can talk about something else but thats always going to change and love is never going to change i care about politics just like any other citizen im against the war in iraq or any type of war the only thing i have no control over is the politics that goes on within the record company its always been the same but its far tougher now because record companies are run by financial people before they were run by creative people politics is much too serious to be taken too seriously equally there are many aspects of it so laughable as to be lamentable politics is the enemy of the imagination london in the 70s was a pretty catastrophic dump i can tell you we had every kind of industrial trouble we had severe energy problems we were under constant terrorist attack from irish terrorist groups who started a bombing campaign in english cities politics were fantastically polarized between left and right the journey for women no matter what venue it is  politics business film  its its a long journey my politics are of a practical kind  the integrity of the country the supremacy of the federal government an honorable peace or none at all i understand the damage the expenses crisis has done to parliament and the paramount importance of restoring trust in our politics nothing is irreparable in politics in argument truth always prevails finally in politics falsehood always i hate politics i like to write about it but to get involved in it to try and make a lot of ignorant people do what you want them to do waste of time go and write a book its more important and itll last longer there will be no politics no ifs and buts if we see something and feel that work needs to be done we will get people here we can rely on and ensure it is done in the same thorough way as our other projects i dont take a great deal of interest in party politics social politics interests me a great deal more america wants solutions america wants a leader no more tabloid politics growing up politics never trickled down to the areas we come from but people from obamas camp and obama himself reached out to me and asked for my help on the campaign weve sat and had dinner and weve spoken on the phone hes a very sharp guy very charming very cool if you want to know about my politics the only way to do that is to look at my work i have a lot of nice italian winter clothes that make me look like a sophisticated lebanese professor so my friend robert and i go around pretending to be experts in arabic politics it doesnt work in the summer though i dont have the right clothes people feel politics isnt about their lives good politics starts with empathy proceeds to analysis then sets out values and establishes the vision before getting to the nittygritty of policy solutions everything about my politics has been about the future ive committed myself to serve my constituents in south shields and i have committed myself to british politics you have to believe that its through politics that societies can lead social and economic and political change my advice is very simple if you can win a small battle it gives you confidence in the political process to take on bigger battles and so it is very much a bottomup grassroots way of doing politics politicians talk in generalities and lies and i think theyve caused all our grief theyre so awful theyre really funny i hate thinking this because my dad loved politics politics is pop our job as comedians  especially me as a latenight talk show which is a broader audience  is to amplify what we think america is thinking people are fed up with the politics where candidates just rip each other apart and then the voters lose in the end because no one really knows what anybody stands for my philosophy comes from a worldview that looks at the world as one its a holistic view that sees the world as interconnected and interdependent and integrated in so many different ways which informs my politics whenever you discuss politics it is always better to use individual names rather then the term neocon the art of politics consists in knowing precisely when it is necessary to hit an opponent slightly below the belt i came into politics because i wished to change things you cant do that by lying to people you have to educate and persuade and carry them with you  and its often a long haul i loathe and detest all this trivialisation of politics politics is not a healthy lifestyle short of being prime minister there isnt a better job in british politics than running london ive always said that in politics your enemies cant hurt you but your friends will kill you politics is the skilled use of blunt objects beware the politically obsessed they are often bright and interesting but they have something missing in their natures there is a hole an empty place and they use politics to fill it up it leaves them somehow misshapen i became active in politics because i saw the possibility if we all sat back and did nothing of a world in which there would no longer be any stages for actors to act on i hate politics hate deals and dealmaking hate meeting with attorneys and agents the essential ingredient of politics is timing in my early 20s i studied history and politics and i really thought that perhaps i would devote my life to that im not involved in politics any more and theyre quite right im not taking any interest in politics im not involved in politics in any way my life is in writing now politics should share one purpose with religion the steady emancipation of the individual through the education of his passions i am interested in politics the movies were custard compared to politics the conversion of agnostic high tories to the anglican church is always rather suspect it seems too pat and predictable too clearly a matter of politics rather than faith political correctness in my humor i never talk about politics i was never much into all that theres a nastiness out there that wants to harm me with words these are my enemies  the ideologues the populists the columnists who dont like the fact that i take them on toetotoe what i try to do is tell the truth its not the coin of the realm in politics the tax issue is the most powerful issue in american politics going back to the tea party people say oh grover norquist has power no grover norquist and americans for tax reform focus on the tax issue the tax issue is a powerful issue look the center right coalition in american politics today is best understood as a coalition of groups and individuals that on the issue that brings them to politics what they want from the government is to be left alone in my case i was covering politics in texas as a newspaper man in the 1960s value your freedom or you will lose it teaches history dont bother us with politics respond those who dont want to learn men enter local politics solely as a result of being unhappily married american politics used to be an amateur sport but somewhere along the way we handed over to professionals all the things people used to do for free does politics have to be injected into everything gossip is easy politics is hard this is not the time for partisan bickering this is not the time for politics as usual some of us are democrats some of us are republicans some of us are independents above all we must be oklahomans first broadcasters or politicians or writers who think that they are respecting struggle street the battlers by dumbing things down into oneline sound bites are not respecting them they are treating them with contempt its our job above all in politics to tackle the big issues and to explain them the proliferation of outlets that digital technology has enabled has itself contributed to the changing nature of what we regard as news and the way in which many citizens perceive politics it is our job above all in politics to tackle the big issues and to explain them and have the honesty to say to people there are no easy solutions here the only reason to be in politics is public service theres no other reason frankly if thats the best job you can get in terms of money thats too bad you know because frankly its not well paid everyone knows that so for most people its a big sacrifice i will go to the next election saying to australians vote for me vote for the liberal party and i will become your pm so im offering myself as the alternative pm  thats one way people describe the leader of the opposition  but im not in politics for myself to realize a personal ambition i dont want to force my politics on my readers i could pose in fashion commercials as a high society star but politics is a new way of life whats going on in the senate is kind of a politics of escalation were getting sort of like the mideast pay back everybody when youre in charge the politics of judges is getting to be red hot look how many millions of people are underemployed or have lost their jobs the last thing im going to do is play politics with their future president obama chose politics over leadership hope and change have become baitandswitch i dont for the life of me understand how anybody could contemplate the results of the 2000 election in the us and say that electoral politics doesnt matter any more and that ralph nader was right when he said there is no difference between the two parties i first came to think about media and politics in the late 1960s having observed some distortions up close but since then i wouldnt say that my personal experience has remained an important motive for my writing about media my position is not that john kerry is either jesus christ or the prophet mohammad my position is that john kerry is the possibility of restarting politics right now we have no possibility of politics because we have a oneparty state well australias been in afghanistan from the get go way back in 2001 but we have been resolute throughout and with support from both sides of australian politics look at the declining television coverage look at the declining voting rate economics and economic news is what moves the country now not politics beyond politics the west is suffering from what can be called a crisis of brokenness  broken institutions broken families and broken souls newt gingrich is one of the brightest people in the republican party and hes always been a little unorthodox in his approach to politics but thats what makes him newt gingrich a week is a long time in politics no i probably do better not being in politics they have too much control over you when you are in politics theres not a single chef i know of that does not think about the politics of the food theyre serving my publicist told me not to talk about politics but yes i think we have a president who stole the election you should never ask actors about politics theres a couple things you dont talk about in life and thats race religion and politics i try to make sure i dont talk about politics at all good thing weve still got politics in texas  finest form of free entertainment ever invented i never saw anything funnier than texas politics the tucs new slogan a future that works sets a profound challenge austerity and rapid deficit reduction is failing in its own terms but even at its best it is shortsighted muddlethrough politics with no vision of a new economic model politics is very interesting and always leads to conflict i am not at all a politician i dont think im cut out for politics i am certainly not going to stand for election i met my wife anne who was a sociology student and her influence together with activities associated with the student movement of the time opened up my interests amongst other things into the theatre art music politics and philosophy im not very active politically the causes i work on offer immediate practical accessible help and politics has never meant that to me is anyone serious about the politics of happiness david cameron dipped a toe in the water using the word lightly but denying the hard policies it implies labour shies away from it but should take up the challenge my job is to look at what politics is doing not be a politician myself all tools have intrinsic politics and technology is the tool of now when we talk about safety and security of the american people politics falls aside pretty quickly liberalism is rationalism in politics its true that its within the realm of cultural politics that young people tend to work through political issues which i think is good although its not going to solve the problems i have always hated celebrities lecturing people on politics so forgive me but i am passionate about this country i am equally passionate about the potential of the people who live here difference of religion breeds more quarrels than difference of politics things happen in american politics in the political center if the president will meet us in the center there are things we can accomplish politics is the science of urgencies i look for the humanity in people however big the politics or oppressive the situation may be whether its subsumed within a human being or between two human beings i want to help us hold a mirror to ourselves theres a rule of thumb in politics if youre at a point where youre complaining about the other guy being mean and unfair and uncivil thats probably a sign that youre losing i know my limitations and i dont like politics i was only involved because of my husband it seems to be the thing now that young people are getting back into politics i think especially in a world where you have so little say about what goes on in your life or in the politics of the world around you it is wonderful to go into that studio and tell yourself what to do theres people coming in whove never done any politics at all whove never been in a trade union theyve never been in a political party theyve never done anything but they do feel a kind of urgency i think ralph nader is the biggest liar in american politics when he said it didnt matter who was president i think one of the most threatening places to be in politics is a black conservative because there are so many liberals who want to continue to reinforce a stereotype that doesnt exist about america the one thing we can all be sure about in politics is you are as well to expect the unexpected i am genuinely not an overthetop kind of person about politics or anything else yes you need substance in politics  but i think your style also says something about how you arrive at some of your conclusions music and politics are in essence about communication without overstretching the analogy i do feel a sense of rhythm is important in getting your message across the larger meaning here is that mainstream journalists simply cannot talk about things that the two parties agree on this is the black hole of american politics until politics are a branch of science we shall do well to regard political and social reforms as experiments rather than shortcuts to the millennium rush limbaugh we expect nonsense from him but the vatican thats another story when the vatican is so threatened that it launches attacks on nuns well you know what they say in politics a hit dog hollers in so much of politics youre not allowed to disagree with whats been agreed im not deeply ideologically driven i believe in good centerright politics i always had a longterm view of going into politics so i suppose i was always careful i mean i got offered all these rinky dink tax deals but i always paid my taxes i am naturally quite conservative i was really fascinated by politics it always has been part of my view that politics really is a calling or you wouldnt go into it because its demanding and potentially has a toll on you and your family politics is gut commercials are gut the challenge in working in politics particularly if youre working for a political party is that everyones a messenger what matters most in politics is personality its not issues its not image its who you are and what you represent ive done reasonably well over the last 10 years because i took the strategy of language and politics and applied it to the corporate world which has never been done before macroeconomic policy can never be devoid of politics it involves fundamental tradeoffs and affects different groups differently hope springs eternal even in politics when you look at our world the truth is that were all under the influence of politics even if we dont know it or arent aware of it politics and philosophy are really what make our up lives politics makes strange bedfellows im interested in current affairs and social policy as a whole but i dont watch politics for sport on the show we are not trying to get people to eat their vegetables we are not trying to get people to become democrats we are basically trying to encourage people to get involved with public life so that politics isnt left to the wealthy and privileged im no expert on american politics robert kennedy was such an inspiring figure his interest in politics seemed to come not from a desire for power but from a need to help our society live up to its ideals in washington dc politics dominate even the most casual conversations in politics it seems retreat is honorable if dictated by military considerations and shameful if even suggested for ethical reasons if we tried to write about politics youd realize that were all a bunch of idiots i ask you turn a deaf ear to the special interests let politics stand down for a while dont waste anytime thinking about future elections until weve done our jobs here my political science degree is always on the backburner i took my lsat so even if i want to take the lsat again i know what im getting into ill keep it on the backburner who knows maybe with my popularity i can have a career in politics with a law degree i think itll work out either way every week i read about myself in a magazine about something that i havent done or some place that ive never been or dont even know its just gossip rumors egos and politics i was in the room with you know more than a dozen republicans trying to negotiate the stimulus most of them decided the politics of the situation meant they should walk away even if it wasnt responsible in terms of what our country needed right then music shouldnt be based around money or politics music should be a bunch of people that really do great songs together doing them together for the pursuit of having a good time inauthenticity is endemic in american politics today the political backrooms where i spent much of my career were just as benighted as my personal life equally crowded with shadowy strangers and compromises truths i hoped to deny i lived not in one closet but in many you never know whatll happen in politics i kept a steel wall around my moral and sexual instincts  protecting them i thought from the threats of the real world this gave me a tremendous advantage in politics if not in my soul the true me my spiritual core slipped further and further from reach but being in the closet uniquely assisted me in politics from my first run for the state legislature until my election as governor all too often i was not leading but following my best guess at public opinion my mom is like this hardcore liberal feminist shes a professor in boston and shes been teaching womens studies for 30 years and international politics i think the rules are going to have to change for me to ever run for public office my checkered past will always keep me out of politics im not entirely sure what my end goal is but id love to get involved in city politics and broadcast tv you know i started my career in politics in 1967 im not new to this i did not just fall off the christmas tree i understand the world is complex i know that there are people out there who want to hurt other people when you come from desperate poverty and thats exactly what i come from you know that nonsenses are not to be tolerated im not sure who gains from chaos but i know its not the poor folks in the council flats the politics of vindictiveness is never ever anything like a solution let me tell you sisters seeing dried egg on a plate in the morning is a lot dirtier than anything ive had to deal with in politics i just feel like im a very lucky person to have a new life outside of politics since the governments are in the pockets of businesses whos going to control this most powerful institution business is more powerful than politics and its more powerful than religion so its going to have to be the vigilante consumer divorced from ethics leadership is reduced to management and politics to mere technique the gays like project runway because its a fashion and the gays are into fashion and into design its a creative industry and most of the gays are pretty creative in general thats just like the culture were not all into politics necessarily were more into the creative environment i also think heidi is a big draw the boys love heidi and think shes so fabulous i just think its a glitzy fun show and there are also always lots of gay boys on it and you know thats fun i would say that no film is apolitical there are politics in all films any film that is anchored in a society any film that deals with humanity is necessarily political i was very aware of office politics because i was so baffled by them so much so goes unsaid no one says youre a cheeky soandso no one says youre so moody nobody ever confronts anyone else about anything but im very crass and im very confrontational and i have a temper i had to be hypervigilant in every office i worked in i always wanted to work at take a break magazine you know just to inject a little bit of politics into their stories i applied for a job there after id done my law degree and didnt even get an interview i only wrote garnethill because i didnt get that job be your own politics grow your own garden and maybe you can help out more we would not have our politics distracted and embittered by the dissensions of other lands acting is fun and i refuse to get involved in the semantics and the politics of strategy and breaking out of something or doing something because you need to do something else for me its all about what fuels my soul and if im passionate about a screenplay then thats what ill do next politics is politics art is art if you play a political role you have to stop being an artist we can play politics or we can reduce crime in politics sometimes you have to lie or you make a promise that you cannot keep politics isnt about left versus right its about top versus bottom i was supposed to be womens lib and now id exceeded it and gone over into international politics in politics there are no friends we are naive and moralistic women we are human beings who find politics a blight upon the human condition and do not know how one copes with it except through politics abortion politics have distracted all sides from what is really essential a major aid campaign to improve midwifery prenatal care and emergency obstetric services in poor countries imagine a civilisation thats way in advance of us wants to communicate with us and assist us in our development the information we provide to them must reflect our highest aspirations and ideals and not just be some crazy persons bizarre politics or religion i never let my politics supersede my manners politics like theater is one of those things where youve got to be wise enough to know when to leave lenin said that people vote with their feet well thats whats happening they either go or they dont go its all politics its all demographics i wanted the feel in these books to be like an epic fantasy with kings queens dukes and court politics but of course like what i was explaining before about making the science make sense you have to make the politics make sense too if one of my boys was asking me if they should go into politics id say theres only one reason to go into public life and thats to help people my first meeting as a senator my first day they were already talking about the next election part of thats the permanent campaign part of thats a word ive been using more frequently tribal our politics has become tribal its us versus them im pleased to offer analysis of public policy and politics to the millions of americans who get their news from fox well a lot of politics is communicating with people and obviously comedy has something to do with that ive been a producer and led people also being a comedian youre under pressure i think to be in politics you have to have the taste for blood on that the next thing i am doing is moving back home to minnesota and getting involved in politics im looking at a run for senate in 2008 but in the meantime i am focused on knitting together the progressive network in the upper midwest the sheeppeople dont think for themselves anymore you can say anything and its the gospel truth and they dont have to go research it or anything and they believe everything the news tells them people dont go and do their own investigations if its relationships or politics or anything the legions of reporters who cover politics dont want to quit the clash and thunder of electoral combat for the dry duty of analyzing the federal budget as a consequence we have created the perpetual presidential campaign politics aside it will be hard for any new liberal radio network to outdo the professionalism of npr it is important to recognize and politics positive thinking is often the slaves virtue  something that people do to con themselves about the burden and change being placed upon them as a politician who cherishes religious conviction in his personal sphere but regards politics as a domain belonging outside religion i believe that this view is seriously flawed every artistic expression is either influenced by or adds something to politics i was raised to speak out about politics and the world around me i would do it whether i was in the public or not it is the way i was taught the american way all politics is local i think that what im doing is right and electionyear politics which intensifies everything is not going to drive me off that course by asking the question am i happy and via the answer setting out what i mean by happiness there is a political route that can be taken by asking another question  can politics deliver happiness and should it try so here is one of my theories on happiness we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end this view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of philip gould philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics when he died i felt like i had lost a limb there has been a shift to what may be defined as a culture of negativity which goes well beyond coverage of politics ive done business with people ive met in politics who i went to law school with who i grew up with who do you do business with people you meet in life as ive gotten older ive gotten more liberal and my father is increasingly conservative its so shocking to me because i always thought we had the same politics the day i realized we voted for different presidents i practically fell out of my chair you help me ill help you thats politics as a society i think we express our cultural mores through our politics were trying constantly to figure out whats ok and whats not ok and its hard because our society is constantly buffeted by gale force winds of technology things are always changing people like to do politics with me and they like to do business we talked about politics constantly in my family growing up in north carolina there were always debates being of greek background its in our blood to drink coffee and talk politics anyone in politics would like to have great economic numbers whether you are on the right or the left everyone can agree that there are a lot of outside influences in american politics that are not good for the system theres just too much money about 25 years ago i started out as a reporter covering politics and that sort of just evolved into organized crime because organized crime and politics were the same thing in boston but look you did not have to be well versed in politics to know that some stupid things were going on it is the counsels job to stop them and instead the coverup was created im not really one of those people who believes that if youre a musician you can just leave that behind and start getting into politics a purely objective viewpoint does not exist in the cosmos or in politics when youre young with less on the line its easier to be audacious to experiment so i introduced the concerns of my generation  politics sex drugs rockandroll etc  to the comics page which for many years caused a rolling furor in my rightwing politics of the time i held that unemployment was usually the fault of the unemployed i did not resign from politics because of bofors i resigned because i do not know how to play petty politics i did not know back then and i dont know now either broadway is such a diverse community everybody knows how i believe and everyone believes and its not a big deal but in hollywood if you talk about politics  especially if youre a republican  or spirituality its just not something people want to hear about i just worry a lot im a worrier michelle and barack are really dear to me i mean i love them and i dont want to see them get hurt just the nature of politics is hurtful so every time they are hurt i get hurt its a lot to ask of people and its a lot to see your friends go through its hard not to get emotional i was totally absorbed in the real world the politics the history the news and i just couldnt find my way into the fictional world when i finally could return to writing the novel it was in fits and starts i dont want to be a politician i dont like politics its petty it fights dirty i like politics i like traveling in the united states politics is a people business i like people i mean the part you dont like i mean thats the only part thats the part no one likes and that is the criticisms and the unfair criticisms i might add of my husband but thats also just a fact of life in politics the argument of the broken window pane is the most valuable argument in modern politics so my degree was in political science which i think was  the closest i could come to marketing is politics american influence in the world is certainly considerable but the united states does not control directly or indirectly the politics and economics of other societies as empires have always done save for a few special cases that turn out to be the exceptions that prove the rule we dont tend to write about disease in fiction  not just teen novels but all american novels  because it doesnt fit in with our idea of the heroic romantic epic there is room only for sacrifice heroism war politics and family struggle the thing about american politics as ive learned is there is no choice conscience has no more to do with gallantry than it has with politics on the other side i do believe that the rhetoric we are seeing from the democrats today is unprecedented is a new low in presidential politics and goes beyond political discourse and amounts to political hate speech i mean that i think i find the psychology of people more interesting than politics i think the psychology of politics is more interesting than straight politics people like passion in politics politics swings like a pendulum i think karl rove saw that in george w bush early on and understood the impact that he could have on texas politics and probably on national politics my mothers studies stopped with the third year of primary school my father with the first they taught me a deep sense of duty but nobody was involved in politics in my family i was on leave from local and regional politics as long as i was a minister in politics the choice is constantly between two evils politics is a field where the choice lies constantly between two blunders money has too big an influence on our politics in washington and somehow we need to do something about that there was a widespread indignation in the american media they were saying how can you make a movie during an election thats about politics what are you doing are you trying to influence peoples lives to which my response was well i hope so in politics madame you need two things friends but above all an enemy truth is i dont think god on a daily basis i think politics science every person has only so much attention to give and politics and government takes up only a fraction of what it did 25 years ago for us sons of france political sentiment is a passion while for the englishmen politics are a question of business chicago is known for good steaks expensive stores and beautiful architecture unfortunately the windy city also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics violent crime and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country it is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear living in washington you cant take politics too seriously i draw the line at honesty i have no time for political hacks who say things they dont believe because they get paid to well i think any time you delve into this sort of religion politics as you well know youre going to you know touch a few nerves i wasnt  now  and this is the honest truth i think he was absolutely right not to go to un last week first things first  that is values and people here in their local communities and remembering all politics is local and trusting people more we must remember that politics is more than a power game the core of politics in my view is to serve our citizens to serve our fellow human beings i am involved with politics today because of the inspiration i received from ronald reagan as i became very defined in my personal politics i turned down some films that i slightly regret now im not going to say what they were were seeing quite a lot of people who really would like a return to classbased politics i dont find music being less important than like politics in ancient greece politics and the market were not decoupled money in politics is a huge issue i have always said i will be in politics to serve as best as i can and it will take me wherever it will take me yes is a far more potent word than no in american politics by adopting the positions which animate the political agenda for the other side one can disarm them and leave them sputtering with nothing to say i believe in incentivizing people if you can incentivize people in anything whether its in politics in life in spirituality in business just take care of folks incentivize them and all of a sudden its amazing the difference that youll see if greece had gone through a very normal political life i may have not been in politics but just the fact that i lived through huge upheavals and very difficult struggles and polarization and the barbarism of dictatorships  that made me feel that we had to change this country people meet in bars after work all over the world and talk about the great problems of life and death and the world and politics and they dont take themselves seriously they can do nothing else except chat about these things in bars after work spontaneous combustion of grassroots politics is the future there is this concept of politics as a dirty game its a difficult game but it doesnt have to be dirty i think this is what we need to bring to politics i think politics around the world has very often been captured by big interests  lobbies they call them in the states this idea that a book can either be about character and feeling or about politics and idea is just a false binary ideas are an expression of the feelings and the intense emotions we hold about the world most people get their politics obviously from tv shows about senators or movies about them or all the daytoday press and the talk shows i call it peopletopeople politics and thats what politics should be about reaching out and helping one another and touching one another about what were going to do politics was my third act but i could have a fourth i dont know what that will be yet but there will be one first take the government of the indians out of politics second let the laws of the indians be the same as those of the whites third give the indian the ballot we mistake politics for legislative debate you can be passionate without being personal the difference between the men and the boys in politics is and always has been that the boys want to be something while the men want to do something on the mountains mistakes are fatal in politics mistakes are wounding emotionally but you recover personally wilderness helps me get back in touch with natural rhythms helps me reflect and in the process restore my creativity the only politics in this country thats relevant to black people today is the politics of revolution none other only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power we have guided missiles and misguided men science investigates religion interprets science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong bad times have a scientific value these are occasions a good learner would not miss science does not know its debt to imagination men love to wonder and that is the seed of science the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom aerodynamically the bumble bee shouldnt be able to fly but the bumble bee doesnt know it so it goes on flying anyway science never solves a problem without creating ten more a scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it the most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds new discoveries is not eureka but thats funny science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life the best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance  the idea that anything is possible touch a scientist and you touch a child we are born at a given moment in a given place and like vintage years of wine we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born astrology does not lay claim to anything more research is what im doing when i dont know what im doing each problem that i solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems your theory is crazy but its not crazy enough to be true anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words ye must have faith anthropology demands the openmindedness with which one must look and listen record in astonishment and wonder that which one would not have been able to guess there is a single light of science and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere if a mans wit be wandering let him study the mathematics a fact is a simple statement that everyone believes it is innocent unless found guilty a hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe it is guilty until found effective science is simply common sense at its best that is rigidly accurate in observation and merciless to fallacy in logic science knows no country because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence the great tragedy of science  the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact the scientific theory i like best is that the rings of saturn are composed entirely of lost airline luggage science is the father of knowledge but opinion breeds ignorance it is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast it keeps him young science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition the fewer the facts the stronger the opinion what is a scientist after all it is a curious man looking through a keyhole the keyhole of nature trying to know whats going on science is organized common sense where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact i see nothing in space as promising as the view from a ferris wheel few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even to hope by a limit imposed from without but falsely identified as lying within adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery and you lose for certain and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer your approach to this certainty i believe in general in a dualism between facts and the ideas of those facts in human heads every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination for nasa space is still a high priority i hate facts i always say the chief end of man is to form general propositions  adding that no general proposition is worth a damn science is a firstrate piece of furniture for a mans upper chamber if he has common sense on the ground floor if an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right but if he says that it is impossible he is very probably wrong inanimate objects can be classified scientifically into three major categories those that dont work those that break down and those that get lost you cannot feed the hungry on statistics science and technology revolutionize our lives but memory tradition and myth frame our response i am not a scientist i am rather an impresario of scientists the nineteenth century believed in science but the twentieth century does not a year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in god the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success we seem to have a compulsion these days to bury time capsules in order to give those people living in the next century or so some idea of what we are like the folly of mistaking a paradox for a discovery a metaphor for a proof a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths and oneself for an oracle is inborn in us in science fact can only mean confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent i suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms we can lick gravity but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming there are no shortcuts in evolution science is wonderfully equipped to answer the question how but it gets terribly confused when you ask the question why when i find myself in the company of scientists i feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light they say forgetful of the shadows speed nobody climbs mountains for scientific reasons science is used to raise money for the expeditions but you really climb for the hell of it all science requires mathematics the knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us this is the easiest of sciences a fact which is obvious in that no ones brain rejects it for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon from now on we live in a world where man has walked on the moon its not a miracle we just decided to go science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being men the doctor has been taught to be interested not in health but in disease what the public is taught is that health is the cure for disease people think of the inventor as a screwball but no one ever asks the inventor what he thinks of other people it will free man from the remaining chains the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is of course living in a state of sin facts are the air of scientists without them you can never fly scientific theory is a contrived foothold in the chaos of living phenomena the science of today is the technology of tomorrow the cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from science along with behaviour control genetic engineering transplanted heads computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance it accumulates in the form of inert facts bush reiterated his stand to conservatives opposing his decision on stem cell research he said today he believes life begins at conception and ends at execution he is so old that his blood type was discontinued take young researchers put them together in virtual seclusion give them an unprecedented degree of freedom and turn up the pressure by fostering competitiveness a satellite has no conscience in all science error precedes the truth and it is better it should go first than last if we wish to make a new world we have the material ready the first one too was made out of chaos there is one thing even more vital to science than intelligent methods and that is the sincere desire to find out the truth whatever it may be the radical novelty of modern science lies precisely in the rejection of the belief that the forces which move the stars and atoms are contingent upon the preferences of the human heart the scientist is motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire for truth when i investigate and when i discover that the forces of the heavens and the planets are within ourselves then truly i seem to be living among the gods the next major explosion is going to be when genetics and computers come together im talking about an organic computer  about biological substances that can function like a semiconductor some dreamers demand that scientists only discover things that can be used for good sadly embryonic stem cell research is completely legal in this country and has been going on at universities and research facilities for years scientists worldwide agree that the reduction needed to stabilize the climate is actually more like 80 percent polygraph tests are 20thcentury witchcraft anthropology was the science that gave her the platform from which she surveyed scolded and beamed at the world half of the modern drugs could well be thrown out of the window except that the birds might eat them leave the atom alone whenever anyone says theoretically they really mean not really there was no before the beginning of our universe because once upon a time there was no time science without religion is lame religion without science is blind the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and science to raise new questions new possibilities to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it the grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple and may as a rule be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking the man of science is a poor philosopher it stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome mans insecurity before himself and before nature science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all  the apathy of human beings success is a science if you have the conditions you get the result a fools brain digests philosophy into folly science into superstition and art into pedantry hence university education romance should never begin with sentiment it should begin with science and end with a settlement let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors together let us explore the stars conquer the deserts eradicate disease tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody before it was actually verified we have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology this is a prescription for disaster we might get away with it for a while but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces im concentrating on staying healthy having peace being happy remembering what is important taking in nature and animals spending time reading trying to understand the universe where science and the spiritual meet if civilization is to survive we must cultivate the science of human relationships  the ability of all peoples of all kinds to live together in the same world at peace therefore the good of man must be the end of the science of politics we live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge it is those who know little and not those who know much who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science art is the beautiful way of doing things science is the effective way of doing things business is the economic way of doing things imagination is the key to my lyrics the rest is painted with a little science fiction the church saves sinners but science seeks to stop their manufacture there will one day spring from the brain of science a machine or force so fearful in its potentialities so absolutely terrifying that even man the fighter who will dare torture and death in order to inflict torture and death will be appalled and so abandon war forever democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage germany has reduced savagery to a science and this great war for the victorious peace of justice must go on until the german cancer is cut clean out of the world body science can purify religion from error and superstition religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes the greatest advances of civilization whether in architecture or painting in science and literature in industry or agriculture have never come from centralized government wisdom alone is the science of other sciences science is nothing but perception part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because were hardwired not to always think clearly when were scared and the countrys scared he who possesses art and science has religion he who does not possess them needs religion english is necessary as at present original works of science are in english i believe that in two decades times original works of science will start coming out in our languages then we can move over like the japanese the whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner but that they reflect a certain underlying order which may or may not be divinely inspired there is no way that writers can be tamed and rendered civilized or even cured the only solution known to science is to provide the patient with an isolation room where he can endure the acute stages in private and where food can be poked in to him with a stick individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today  but the core of science fiction its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all skeptical scrutiny is the means in both science and religion by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense science arose from poetry when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends the credit of advancing science has always been due to individuals and never to the age the difference between science and the fuzzy subjects is that science requires reasoning while those other subjects merely require scholarship one could write a history of science in reverse by assembling the solemn pronouncements of highest authority about what could not be done and could never happen he who would do good to another must do it in minute particulars general good is the plea of the scoundrel hypocrite and flatterer for art and science cannot exist but in minutely organized particulars i am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students if we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us that we are the reason there is a universe does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines when i die im leaving my body to science fiction science is what you know philosophy is what you dont know it has become almost a cliche to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics science has explained nothing the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness i have seen firsthand that agricultural science has enormous potential to increase the yields of small farmers and lift them out of hunger and poverty every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable as those by which the universe is regulated and governed man cannot make principles he can only discover them theology is a science of mind applied to god false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science for they often endure long but false views if supported by some evidence do little harm for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness the capacity to be puzzled is the premise of all creation be it in art or in science specialized meaninglessness has come to be regarded in certain circles as a kind of hallmark of true science we want to answer this classical question who am i so i think that most of our works are for art or whatever we do including science or religion tried to answer that question the god whom science recognizes must be a god of universal laws exclusively a god who does a wholesale not a retail business he cannot accommodate his processes to the convenience of individuals man lives for science as well as bread shun no toil to make yourself remarkable by some talent or other yet do not devote yourself to one branch exclusively strive to get clear notions about all give up no science entirely for science is but one science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesnt exist yet but soon will and will change everything for everybody and nothing will ever be the same again as soon as you have an idea that changes some small part of the world you are writing science fiction it is always the art of the possible never the impossible the fundamental concept in social science is power in the same sense in which energy is the fundamental concept in physics the march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people it often means the opposite weve arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology i do not believe in god his existence has been disproved by science but in the concentration camp i learned to believe in men science is global einsteins equation emc2 has to reach everywhere science is a beautiful gift to humanity we should not distort it science does not differentiate between multiple races life is not an exact science it is an art science is organized knowledge wisdom is organized life time travel used to be thought of as just science fiction but einsteins general theory of relativity allows for the possibility that we could warp spacetime so much that you could go off in a rocket and return before you set out the product of mental labor  science  always stands far below its value because the labortime necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labortime required for its original production science must have originated in the feeling that something was wrong this world after all our science and sciences is still a miracle wonderful inscrutable magical and more to whosoever will think of it as long as men are free to ask what they must free to say what they think free to think what they will freedom can never be lost and science can never regress almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attributable to science which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century art is the tree of life science is the tree of death natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science there will be one science science in the modern world has many uses its chief use however is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich i am one of those scientists who feels that it is no longer enough just to get on and do science we have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance vanity of science knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science the enlightenment is under threat so is reason so is truth so is science especially in the schools of america it vexes me when they would constrain science by the authority of the scriptures and yet do not consider themselves bound to answer reason and experiment the usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe why does the universe go to all the bother of existing in questions of science the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual science has not yet mastered prophecy we predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10 science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness the foundation of empire is art and science remove them or degrade them and the empire is no more empire follows art and not vice versa as englishmen suppose politics is a science you can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong the pursuit of science leads only to the insoluble science is properly more scrupulous than dogma dogma gives a charter to mistake but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake and must keep the conscience alive science is not only a disciple of reason but also one of romance and passion blind faith no matter how passionately expressed will not suffice science for its part will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition when youre thirsty and it seems that you could drink the entire ocean thats faith when you start to drink and finish only a glass or two thats science science fiction writers foresee the inevitable and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable solutions are not political liberty the peace of a nation and science itself are gifts for which fate demands a heavy tax in blood the universe is governed by science but science tells us that we cant solve the equations directly in the abstract science is but an image of the truth science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature and that is because in the last analysis we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve science my lad is made up of mistakes but they are mistakes which it is useful to make because they lead little by little to the truth of course in science there are things that are open to doubt and things need to be discussed but among the things that science does know evolution is about as certain as anything we know the work of science is to substitute facts for appearances and demonstrations for impressions to me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science political ideology can corrupt the mind and science science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing it is a matter of chance which we are in the capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius of erudition and of science philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science particularly physics the media need superheroes in science just as in every sphere of life but there is really a continuous range of abilities with no clear dividing line i used to think information was destroyed in black hole this was my biggest blunder or at least my biggest blunder in science the athanasian creed is to me light and intelligible reading in comparison with much that now passes for science poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars  mere globs of gas atoms i too can see the stars on a desert night and feel them but do i see less or more a science which does not bring us nearer to god is worthless but perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation the wonder of science scientific ways of thinking and the history of scientific ideas rather than laboratory experience we especially need imagination in science it is not all mathematics nor all logic but it is somewhat beauty and poetry formerly when religion was strong and science weak men mistook magic for medicine now when science is strong and religion weak men mistake medicine for magic reason observation and experience the holy trinity of science science coverage could be improved by the recognition that science is timeless and therefore science stories should not need to be pegged to an item in the news science commits suicide when it adopts a creed by any reasonable measure of achievement the faith of the enlightenment thinkers in science was justified if we take science as our sole guide if we accept and hold fast that alone which is verifiable the old theology must go it seems to me that socialists today can preserve their position in academic economics merely by the pretense that the differences are entirely moral questions about which science cannot decide books are the carriers of civilization without books history is silent literature dumb science crippled thought and speculation at a standstill science has done more for the development of western civilization in one hundred years than christianity did in eighteen hundred years mild autism can give you a genius like einstein if you have severe autism you could remain nonverbal you dont want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum but if you got rid of all the autism genetics you wouldnt have science or art all you would have is a bunch of social yak yaks when i look upon seamen men of science and philosophers man is the wisest of all beings when i look upon priests and prophets nothing is as contemptible as man one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit the wealthy are always surrounded by hangerson science and art are as well healing papa would tell me is not a science but the intuitive art of wooing nature in science one tries to tell people in such a way as to be understood by everyone something that no one ever knew before but in poetry its the exact opposite science is nothing but trained and organized common sense books are the money of literature but only the counters of science if history and science have taught us anything it is that passion and desire are not the same as truth borrowing knowledge of reality from all sources taking the best from every study science of mind brings together the highest enlightenment of the ages moral science is better occupied when treating of friendship than of justice the method of political science is the interpretation of life its instrument is insight a nice understanding of subtle unformulated conditions logic is neither an art nor a science but a dodge the man of science has learned to believe in justification not by faith but by verification science has fulfilled her function when she has ascertained and enunciated truth science reckons many prophets but there is not even a promise of a messiah science and literature are not two things but two sides of one thing ecclesiasticism in science is only unfaithfulness to truth in science as in art and as i believe in every other sphere of human activity there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors but it is only in one or two of them no delusion is greater than the notion that method and industry can make up for lack of motherwit either in science or in practical life education has failed in a very serious way to convey the most important lesson science can teach skepticism science and religion are the two most powerful forces in the world having them at odds is not productive the conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that people who investigate heresies must be heretics just as if a doctor who studies leprosy must be a leper indeed it is only recently that science has been allowed to study anything without reproach there are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man beyond history and beyond science the moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit art is science made clear everything is fraught with danger i love technology and i love science its just always all in the way you use it so theres no  you cant really blame anything on the technology its just the way people use it and it always has been there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity it is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition every science begins as philosophy and ends as art the science of the mind can only have for its proper goal the understanding of human nature by every human being and through its use brings peace to every human soul when science art literature and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible which can make a mans name live for thousands of years einstein was searching for string theory it not only reconciles general relativity to quantum mechanics but it reconciles science and the bible as well traditional science assumes for the most part that an objective observer independent reality exists the universe stars galaxies sun moon and earth would still be there if no one was looking we must revisit the idea that science is a methodology and not an ontology snow white is an old fairy tale so obviously the idea of vanity and obsession with youth is longstanding with todays science people have become crazy with trying to move their face around its bizarre science gives us knowledge but only philosophy can give us wisdom i dont read chick lit fantasy or science fiction but ill give any book a chance if its lying there and ive got half an hour to kill the world is full of strange phenomena that cannot be explained by the laws of logic or science dennis rodman is only one example a powerful attraction exists therefore to the promotion of a study and of duties of all others engrossing the time most completely and which is less benefited than most others by any acquaintance with science when push comes to shove it aint the science thats going to lift you upits the belief the spiritual side of life thats going to lift you up no matter what religion you are i like physics i think it is the best science out of all three of them because generally its more useful you learn about speed and velocity and time and thats all clever stuff ive lost my faith in science i want to be the cecil b demille of science fiction art has a double face of expression and illusion just like science has a double face the reality of error and the phantom of truth politics i conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself theres been some research in cognitive science im told that discloses that there have always been perhaps 10 to 15 percent of people who are as pascal puts it so made that they cannot believe to us when people talk about faith its white noise i had people in my life who didnt give up on me my mother my aunt my science teacher i had oneonone speech therapy i had a nanny who spent all day playing turntaking games with me advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science but an art medicine is not only a science it is also an art it does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life which must be understood before they may be guided in science we must be interested in things not in persons the mysteriousness and mystique of space is such that science fiction attempts to tantalize you by telling you a story that could possibly be out there and thats the appeal of science fiction thats the whole problem with science youve got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder medical science has proven time and again that when the resources are provided great progress in the treatment cure and prevention of disease can occur all ones inventions are true you can be sure of that poetry is as exact a science as geometry it is through science that we prove but through intuition that we discover man is unique not because he does science and his is unique not because he does art but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind ayurveda is a sister philosophy to yoga it is the science of life or longevity and it teaches about the power and the cycles of nature as well as the elements modern bodybuilding is ritual religion sport art and science awash in western chemistry and mathematics defying nature it surpasses it art and science have their meeting point in method in science read by preference the newest works in literature the oldest the classic literature is always modern it cannot be said often enough that science fiction as a genre is incredibly educational  and im speaking the written science fiction not star trek science fiction writers tend to fill their books if theyre clever with little bits of interesting stuff and real stuff i have seen the science i worshiped and the aircraft i loved destroying the civilization i expected them to serve the major obstacle to a religious renewal is the intellectual classes who are highly influential and tend to view religion as primitive superstition they believe that science has left atheism as the only respectable intellectual stance there is science logic reason there is thought verified by experience and then there is california medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability we have not given science too big a place in our education but we have made a perilous mistake in giving it too great a preponderance in method in every other branch of study i wasnt with joseph but i believe him my faith did not come to me through science and i will not permit socalled science to destroy it the most watched programme on the bbc after the news is probably doctor who what has happened is that science fiction has been subsumed into modern literature there are grandparents out there who speak klingon who are quite capable of holding down a job no one would think twice now about a parallel universe physics does not change the nature of the world it studies and no science of behavior can change the essential nature of man even though both sciences yield technologies with a vast power to manipulate the subject matters science is a differential equation religion is a boundary condition science is all metaphor i like science and i love gym oh and i like art but im really bad at it im just a terrible drawer i cant draw a circle even with a ruler i cant draw a straight line both the man of science and the man of action live always at the edge of mystery surrounded by it some day science may have the existence of mankind in power and the human race can commit suicide by blowing up the world politicians should read science fiction not westerns and detective stories freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts all good criticism should be judged the way art is you shouldnt read it the way you read history or science that which today calls itself science gives us more and more information and indigestible glut of information and less and less understanding man masters nature not by force but by understanding this is why science has succeeded where magic failed because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature strictly speaking the idea of a scientific poem is probably as nonsensical as that of a poetic science form your life humanly and you have done enough but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine biology is now bigger than physics as measured by the size of budgets by the size of the workforce or by the output of major discoveries and biology is likely to remain the biggest part of science through the twentyfirst century human nature is the only science of man and yet has been hitherto the most neglected society lives by faith and develops by science whence come i and whither go i that is the great unfathomable question the same for every one of us science has no answer to it man has to awaken to wonder  and so perhaps do peoples science is a way of sending him to sleep again after all science is essentially international and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it actually i majored in marketing and i have a bachelor of science though many have tried no one has ever yet explained away the decisive fact that science which can do so much cannot decide what it ought to do definition of statistics the science of producing unreliable facts from reliable figures god created the world the laws of nature were created by god true science tries to find out what god put in the world the trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they dont know what theyre talking about because they werent there they cant speculate about the origins of life because they werent there there are in fact two things science and opinion the former begets knowledge the later ignorance i did although i didnt read from page 1 to page 187 but i read chunks of it i did a little bit of science when i was in the university so i was able to understand the graphs and pie charts and stuff like that it was extremely dry science knows only one commandment  contribute to science for whatever reason i didnt succumb to the stereotype that science wasnt for girls i got encouragement from my parents i never ran into a teacher or a counselor who told me that science was for boys a lot of my friends did there are no such things as applied sciences only applications of science science means simply the aggregate of all the recipes that are always successful all the rest is literature president obama believes in a country where we invest in education in roads and bridges in science and in the future so we can create new opportunities so the next kid can make it big and the kid afer that and the kid after that thats what president obama believes go beyond science into the region of metaphysics real religion is beyond argument it can only be lived both inwardly and outwardly i think thats what distinguishes schmidt really in the movies now so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction and schmidt is simply human theres no melodrama theres no device its just about a human being however far modern science and techniques have fallen short of their inherent possibilities they have taught mankind at least one lesson nothing is impossible knowledge of the sciences is so much smoke apart from the heavenly science of christ science fiction writers i am sorry to say really do not know anything we cant talk about science because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial and usually our fiction is dreadful mythology and science both extend the scope of human beings like science and technology mythology as we shall see is not about opting out of this world but about enabling us to live more intensely within it economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life the result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scotfree and ignores the environmental cost making movies is not rocket science its about relationships and communication and strangers coming together to see if they can get along harmoniously productively and creatively thats a challenge when it works its fantastic and will lift you up when it doesnt work its almost just as fascinating evolution seems to close the heart to some of the plainest spiritual truths while it opens the mind to the wildest guesses advanced in the name of science space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time i warn you against believing that advertising is a science as soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise human science is at a loss everything in food is science the only subjective part is when you eat it the kitchens a laboratory and everything that happens there has to do with science its biology chemistry physics yes theres history yes theres artistry yes to all of that but what happened there what actually happens to the food is all science science without conscience is the death of the soul history is the science of things which are not repeated i also like to look at the dynamic that takes place between religion and science because in a way both are asking the same questions who are we where do we come from why are we here where are we going the methodologies are diametrically opposed but their motivation is the same the wellspring is the same in both cases computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes science is built up of facts as a house is with stones but a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house science is the knowledge of consequences and dependence of one fact upon another inspiration in science may have to do with ideas but not in art in art it is in the senses that are instinctively responsive to the medium of expression no science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power indeed in view of its function religion stands in greater need of a rational foundation of its ultimate principles than even the dogmas of science yet higher religion which is only a search for a larger life is essentially experience and recognized the necessity of experience as its foundation long before science learnt to do so many people and governments share the mistaken belief that science with new ingenious devices and techniques can rescue us from the troubles we face without our having to mend our ways and change our patterns of activity this is not so vast is the field of science the more a man knows the more he will find he has to know science is organized knowledge in science the important thing is to modify and change ones ideas as science advances the humanities need to be defended today against the encroachments of physical science as they once needed to be against the encroachment of theology if christianity is not scientific and science is not god then there is no invariable law and truth becomes an accident i started out writing much more science fictiony stuff and writing about science fiction i also think we need to maintain distinctions  the doctrine of creation is different from a scientific cosmology and we should resist the temptation which sometimes scientists give in to to try to assimilate the concepts of theology to the concepts of science science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation but you cant construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history advertising the science of arresting the human intelligence long enough to get money from it i landed a job with roger corman the job was to write the english dialogue for a russian science fiction picture i didnt speak any russian he didnt care whether i could understand what they were saying he wanted me to make up dialogue i graduated from the university of delaware with a double major in history and political science i liked math  that was my favorite subject  and i was very interested in astronomy and in physical science so i decided on science when i was in college science has proof without any certainty creationists have certainty without any proof of all the failed technologies that litter the onward march of science  steam carriages zeppelins armoured trains  none has been so catastrophic to prosperity as the last centurys attempt to generate electricity from nuclear fission the whole of science and one is tempted to think the whole of the life of any thinking man is trying to come to terms with the relationship between yourself and the natural world why are you here and how do you fit in and whats it all about just after world war ii this country led the world in science by every way you could measure it yet the number of scientists was a tiny proportion of what it is now science is a cemetery of dead ideas true science teaches above all to doubt and to be ignorant we know from science that nothing in the universe exists as an isolated or independent entity i dont think makeup is rocket science or a cure for cancer all science is either physics or stamp collecting new discoveries in science will continue to create a thousand new frontiers for those who still would adventure art is i science is we our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality this view of the world  biocentrism  revolves around the way a subjective experience which we call consciousness relates to a physical process it is a vast mystery and one that i have pursued my entire life the no child left behind program was an incentive to the schools to get their kids up to snuff on math and science and reading theres no question that as science knowledge and technology advance that we will attempt to do more significant things and theres no question that we will always have to temper those things with ethics it is the business of the future to be dangerous and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties nothing retains less of desire in art in science than this will to industry booty possession weve made science experiments of ourselves and our children a body of work such as pasteurs is inconceivable in our time no man would be given a chance to create a whole science nowadays a path is scarcely opened up when the crowd begins to pour in before a war military science seems a real science like astronomy but after a war it seems more like astrology i was always very interested in science and i knew that for me science was a better longterm career than tennis rocket science is tough and rockets have a way of failing science is fun science is curiosity we all have natural curiosity science is a process of investigating its posing questions and coming up with a method its delving in nature is not simply a technical or economical resource and human beings are not mere numbers to suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science environmental management government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic humanity has experienced many revolutionary changes over the course of history revolutions in agriculture in science industrial production as well as numerous political revolutions but these have all been limited to the external aspects of our individual and collective lives the most important thing we can do is inspire young minds and to advance the kind of science math and technology education that will help youngsters take us to the next phase of space travel science always uses metaphor if you start any large theory such as quantum mechanics plate tectonics evolution it takes about 40 years for mainstream science to come around gaia has been going for only 30 years or so fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science im not religious but i put it that way because i feel so strongly its the one thing you do not ever do youve got to have standards what i like about sceptics is that in good science you need critics that make you think crumbs have i made a mistake here if you dont have that continuously you really are up the creek the good sceptics have done a good service but some of the mad ones i think have not done anyone any favours faulkner is a writer who has had much to do with my soul but hemingway is the one who had the most to do with my craft  not simply for his books but for his astounding knowledge of the aspect of craftsmanship in the science of writing science fiction films are not about science they are about disaster which is one of the oldest subjects of art this means that to entrust to science  or to deliberate control according to scientific principles  more than scientific method can achieve may have deplorable effects true science is never speculative it employs hypotheses as suggesting points for inquiry but it never adopts the hypotheses as though they were demonstrated propositions just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology the older generation had greater respect for land than science but we live in an age when science more than soil has become the provider of growth and abundance living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality its time to let science and medicine not politics and rhetoric lead us to good sound policy facts matter science matters reason matters mitt romney has shown an inability to respect any of the three president barack obama not only respects them he relies on them he is an overwhelming and unquestioned choice to continue as president the science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past the record of truths revealed by experience is eminently practical as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future the worst state of affairs is when science begins to concern itself with art politics is not an exact science we have failed to protect science against speculative extensions of nature continuing to assign physical and mathematical properties to hypothetical entities beyond what is observable in nature millions of people were inspired by the apollo program i was five years old when i watched apollo 11 unfold on television and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science engineering and exploration everything is becoming science fiction from the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century science and technology multiply around us to an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think either we use those languages or we remain mute i think mistakes are the essence of science and law its impossible to conceive of either scientific progress or legal progress without understanding the important role of being wrong and of mistakes the most wonderful discovery made by scientists is science itself the artist does not illustrate science but he frequently responds to the same interests that a scientist does further the dignity of the science itself seems to require that every possible means be explored for the solution of a problem so elegant and so celebrated the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it the wise man regulates his conduct by the theories both of religion and science but he regards these theories not as statements of ultimate fact but as artforms the science linking the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather to the climate crisis has matured tremendously in the last couple of years raising children is a creative endeavor an art rather than a science the commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly  to develop strategies of seeing and showing it is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing to pursue science is not to disparage the things of the spirit in fact to pursue science rightly is to furnish the framework on which the spirit may rise science will explain how but not why it talks about what is not what ought to be science is descriptive not prescriptive it can tell us about causes but it cannot tell us about purposes indeed science disavows purposes in the postenlightenment europe of the 19th century the highest authority was no longer the church instead it was science thus was born racial antisemitism based on two disciplines regarded as science in their day  the scientific study of race and the social darwinism of herbert spencer and ernst haeckel since hiroshima and the holocaust science no longer holds its pristine place as the highest moral authority instead that role is taken by human rights it follows that any assault on jewish life  on jews or judaism or the jewish state  must be cast in the language of human rights dreaming in public is an important part of our job description as science writers but there are bad dreams as well as good dreams were dreamers you see but were also realists of a sort i have a better internal and intuitive understanding of folklore and myth than science and technology so in that way fantasy is easier the purpose of science is not to analyze or describe but to make useful models of the world a model is useful if it allows us to get use out of it it should be mandatory that you understand computer science if you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your familys life but change your ghettos life make your ghetto a good neighbourhood learn science try to be like mark zuckerberg bill gates and steve jobs i hesitate to predict whether this theory is true but if the general opinion of mankind is optimistic then were in for a period of extreme popularity for science fiction some of the fdas own scientists have charged that politics not science is behind the fdas actions it is sometimes important for science to know how to forget the things she is surest of when a scientist is ahead of his times it is often through misunderstanding of current rather than intuition of future truth in science there is never any error so gross that it wont one day from some perspective appear prophetic im afraid for all those wholl have the bread snatched from their mouths by these machines what business has science and capitalism got bringing all these new inventions into the works before society has produced a generation educated up to using them those theologians who are beginning to take the doctrine of creation very seriously should pay some attention to sciences story much of todays public anxiety about science is the apprehension that we may forever be overlooking the whole by an endless obsessive preoccupation with the parts i suggest that the introductory courses in science at all levels from grade school through college be radically revised leave the fundamentals the socalled basics aside for a while and concentrate the attention of all students on the things that are not known the central task of science is to arrive stage by stage at a clearer comprehension of nature but this does not at all mean as it is sometimes claimed to mean a search for mastery over nature very few recognize science as the high adventure it really is the wildest of all explorations ever taken by human beings the chance to glimpse things never seen before the shrewdest maneuver for discovering how the world works were as clever as we think we are but well be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains were at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems we do it in science all the time  theres no reason why we cant do it in other endeavors i like fantasy i like horror science fiction because i can get avantgarde with those performances in those movies the violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science i left science then i went into art but i approach things very analytically i choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them science fiction to me has not only things that wouldnt happen but other planets this much we know journalism is not a precise science its on its best day is a crude art we make mistakes i make mistakes with more than 50 years as a journalist i have at least had the opportunity to blow more stories make more mistakes than maybe anybody in television nothing is less important than which fork you use etiquette is the science of living it embraces everything it is ethics it is honor i didnt mind studying obviously math and the physical science subjects interested me more than some of the more artistic subjects but i think i was a pretty good student today the function of the artist is to bring imagination to science and science to imagination where they meet in the myth science knows no country because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world science like art religion commerce warfare and even sleep is based on presuppositions economics has never been a science  and it is even less now than a few years ago more and more nfl players have been willing their bodies to science so that their brains can be studied even if they die of other causes science has yet to isolate the godiva chocolate or prada gene but that doesnt mean your weakness for pricey swag isnt woven into your dna according to a new study of identical twins its less tv ads or labor day sales that make you buy the things you do than the tastes and temperaments that are already part of you at birth the best thing about science is that hard empirical answers are always there if you look hard enough the best thing about religion is that the very absence of that certainty is what requires  and gives rise to  deep feelings of faith when i began in 1960 individuality wasnt an accepted thing to look for it was about speciesspecific behaviour but animal behaviour is not hard science theres room for intuition women tend to be more intuitive or to admit to being intuitive and maybe the hard science approach isnt so attractive the way that science is taught is very cold i would never have become a scientist if i had been taught like that in israel a land lacking in natural resources we learned to appreciate our greatest national advantage our minds through creativity and innovation we transformed barren deserts into flourishing fields and pioneered new frontiers in science and technology honest pioneer work in the field of science has always been and will continue to be lifes pilot on all sides life is surrounded by hostility this puts us under an obligation enough people have now mentioned bill nye the science guy to me that i now desperately avoid it all costs acceptance of the power of god in ones life lays the groundwork for personal commitment to both science and christianity which so often have been in conflict science is a method to keep yourself from kidding yourself it may be that everything the life science companies are telling us will turn out to be right and theres no problem here whatsoever that defies logic im a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy  not so much horror because i get a bit scared my taste in watching things runs from dramas and lowbudget films to highend fantasyscience fiction i dont know anything about science the media thinks that you have to make science sexy and concentrate on themes such as rivalry and the human issues i hate science fiction i think people are realizing that engineering and science are extremely good degrees to get and youll be very highly paid once youve got them im not into politics but i am committed to a cause ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the uk curriculum alongside science and maths  grounding abstract theory merging the practical with the academic my interest in film is sort of catholic  apart from science fiction and horror movies ill watch almost everything design and technology should be the subject where mathematical brainboxes and science whizzkids turn their bright ideas into useful products if i can get some student interested in science if i can show members of the general public whats going on up there in the space program then my jobs been done what i do is not rocket science but i sure do love it science has nothing to be ashamed of even in the ruins of nagasaki the shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved that is the essence of science ask an impertinent question and you are on the way to a pertinent answer science is spectral analysis art is light synthesis what we must understand is that the industries processes and inventions created by modern science can be used either to subjugate or liberate the choice is up to us im an amateur science enthusiast im not even a professional enthusiast i dont know anything i never even passed biology in high school but i read the science section of the newspaper i dont think theres a date minimum or maximum i dont get the whole all right youve got to wait three days to call after the date if i got a number from a girl id call that night theres no science to it for me you just do what it is that you feel like doing nature engenders the science of painting when people think about computer science they imagine people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night my father was my main influence he was a preacher but he was also a history and political science teacher and since he was my hero i wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a teacher unfortunately the global warming hysteria as i see it is driven by politics more than by science unfortunately things are different in climate science because the arguments have become heavily politicised to say that the dogmas are wrong has become politically incorrect the world of science and the world of literature have much in common each is an international club helping to tie mankind together across barriers of nationality race and language i have been doubly lucky being accepted as a member of both what we see today is an american economy that has boomed because of policies and developments of the 1950s and 60s the interstatehighway system massive funding for science and technology a publiceducation system that was the envy of the world and generous immigration policies learn about the world the way it works any kind of science and anthropology its really an interesting place we live in evolution is a really fantastic idea even more than the idea of god i think the world has changed  through technology through winemaking techniques the quality of wine is greater than its ever been whereas ten fifteen years ago it was very easy to find lots of bad wine its kind of hard now the technology the science  its like are you kidding were in the golden years of wine well logos is science or reason something that helps us to function practically and effectively in the world and it must therefore be closely in tune and reflect accurately the realities of the world around us science has to be understood in its broadest sense as a method for comprehending all observable reality and not merely as an instrument for acquiring specialized knowledge it is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that some portion of the neglect of science in england may be attributed to the system of education we pursue perhaps it would be better for science that all criticism should be avowed that science has long been neglected and declining in england is not an opinion originating with me but is shared by many and has been expressed by higher authority than mine the accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages to those who have chosen the profession of medicine a knowledge of chemistry and of some branches of natural history and indeed of several other departments of science affords useful assistance id love to do a movie where the monster is human where the issue is not otherworldly or horror or science fiction science was something that really caught my attention it was something i really could sink my teeth into chastity is the cement of civilization and progress without it there is no stability in society and without it one cannot attain the science of life equipped with his five senses man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure science what business has science and capitalism got bringing all these new inventions into the works before society has produced a generation educated up to using them i very much enjoyed my career in science i didnt leave science because i was disillusioned but felt id done my bit for it after about twentyfive years if the experience of science teaches anything its that the world is very strange and surprising the many revolutions in science have certainly shown that people and especially theologians should try to familiarize themselves with scientific ideas of course science is technical in many respects but there are some very good books that try to set out some of the conceptual structure of science science may never come up with a better office communication system than the coffee break thence results for science as well as for industry the necessity of the division and association of labor i receive and i give  such is human life each directs and is directed in his turn it is critical to develop a biofuel industry powered by feedstocks produced in every corner of the country in addition to the midwest that is why usda has established five regional research centers working on science necessary to ensure profitable biofuels can be produced from a diverse range of feedstocks fashion is the science of appearance and it inspires one with the desire to seem rather than to be now science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research which may provide our scientists with many answers that have for so long been beyond our grasp anthropology is the science which tells us that people are the same the whole world over  except when they are different there does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science there are science and the applications of science bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it and by the way i wanted to point out that kindred is not science fiction youll note theres no science in it its a kind of grim fantasy what im working on now  im back to fantasy although considering that its me im turning it into a kind of science fantasy its a vampire story  but my vampires are biological vampires they didnt become vampires because someone bit them they were born that way ive always seen the world through the eyes of a scientist i love the predictable outcomes that science gives us the control over the world that that can render our science has become terrible our research dangerous our findings deadly we physicists have to make peace with reality reality is not as strong as we are we will ruin reality the main reason for the failure of the modern medical science is that it is dealing with results and not causes nothing more than the patching up of those attacked and the burying of those who are slain without a thought being given to the real strong hold since i was an atheist for many years and came to believe in god through my studies in science it frustrated me to see students and parents who viewed faith and science as enemies it is not so for art in appreciation because art is concerned with human behavior and science is concerned with the behavior of metal or energy it depends on what the fashion is now today its energy its the same soul behind it the same soul you see i had bohemian parents in seattle in the last 60s living in a houseboat my dad wrote science fiction novels and painted big murals and oil paintings now the main areas of higher education that still enjoy considerable financial support from government are subjects like engineering and science and the research ringfence which is the basic minimum to protect britains scientific competitiveness ive loved science fiction ever since i was a little kid mainly from looking at the covers of sciencefiction magazines and books and ive read quite extensively as an adult unlike scientism science in the true sense of the word is open to unbiased investigation of any existing phenomena traditional academic science describes human beings as highly developed animals and biological thinking machines we appear to be newtonian objects made of atoms molecules cells tissues and organs the materialistic paradigm of western science has been a major obstacle for any objective evaluation of the data describing the events occurring at the time of death according to materialistic science any memory requires a material substrate such as the neuronal network in the brain or the dna molecules of the genes blade runner appears regularly two or three times a year in various shapes and forms of science fiction it set the pace for what is essentially urban science fiction urban future and its why ive never revisited that area because i feel ive done it rocket science is really where i fell in love with filmmaking i think camp was incredible but it was so bizarre and i was trying to find my footing in this world where you dont have an audience for immediate validation more than fantasy or even science fiction ray bradbury wrote horror and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear of anything he wasnt afraid of looking uncool  he wasnt scared to openly love innocence or to be optimistic or to write sentimentally when he felt that way growing up in the 70s and 80s science fiction and especially fantasy had such a stigma attached to them i felt so punished and exiled for being devoted to these things much of what tea party candidates claimed about the world and the global economy during the 2010 elections would have earned their adherents a welldeserved f in any freshman economics or earth science class experimental science is fascinating but i dont want to do it i want other people to do it and ill read about it i have a phd in cell biology and thats really manual labor i mean experimental science you do it with your hands so its very different youre out there in a lab cleaning test tubes and it just wasnt that fascinating my background was computer science and business school so eventually i worked my way up where i was running product groups  development testing marketing user education the ever quickening advances of science made possible by the success of the human genome project will also soon let us see the essences of mental disease only after we understand them at the genetic level can we rationally seek out appropriate therapies for such illnesses as schizophrenia and bipolar disease with acknowledgement of residues we can be more easily prepared to grant the unit of science the overlapping of disciplines and the total coherence of all facts observation is a passive science experimentation an active science instead in the absence of respect for human rights science and its offspring technology have been used in this century as brutal instruments for oppression ive got a full plate yes i do that ipod thats nice a phone recorder nicely done all right im a bit of a tech geek i have a subscription to popular science and i keep up on all this stuff drill everything mine everything roll back regulations tweak the science expedite permits sound familiar the republicans offer up more 19thcentury solutions to our 21stcentury energy problems many of the mainstream agricultural scientists especially at the agricultural schools but at all of our major universities are tied into all sorts of contractual relationships and consulting relationships with the life science companies whats different here is that we have now technologies that allow these life science companies to bypass classical breeding thats what makes it both powerful and exciting were losing track of the vastness of the potential for computer science we really have to revive the beautiful intellectual joy of it as opposed to the business potential ive always felt that the humancentered approach to computer science leads to more interesting more exotic more wild and more heroic adventures than the machinesupremacy approach where information is the highest goal modern science cannot explain why the laws of physics are exactly balanced for animal life to exist teachers started recognizing me and praising me for being smart in science and that made me want to be even smarter in science the chief difficulty which prevents men of science from believing in divine as well as in nature spirits is their materialism natural science does not simply describe and explain nature it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves just as houses are made of stones so is science made of facts science is facts one would have to have completely forgotten the history of science so as to not remember that the desire to know nature has had the most constant and the happiest influence on the development of mathematics if we reject science we reject the common man biology is the science evolution is the concept that makes biology unique to that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the western nomenclature and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population if science fiction is the mythology of modern technology then its myth is tragic science is analytical descriptive informative man does not live by bread alone but by science he attempts to do so hence the deadliness of all that is purely scientific the art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge i think computer science by and large is still stuck in the modern age postmodernism was a reaction against modernism it came quite early to music and literature and a little later to architecture and i think its still coming to computer science before i was reading science fiction i read hemingway farewell to arms was my first adult novel that said not everything ends well it was one of those times where reading has meant a great deal to me in terms of my development  an insight came from that book i had read tons of science fiction i was fascinated by other worlds other environments for me it was fantasy but it was not fantasy in the sense of pure escapism i was always good at math and science and i never realized that that was unusual or somehow undesirable i love biomedical science i love astronomy and you cant really do much with those in a fantasy setting science is his forte and omniscience his foible we have found that where science has progressed the farthest the mind has but regained from nature that which the mind put into nature one of the nice things about science fiction is that it lets us carry out thought experiments religion is to mysticism what popularization is to science my parents divorced when i was born and my mother is a political science professor like a feminist mormon which is sort of an oxymoron i did one scifi movie i did gattaca i liked gattaca because that was always the kind of science fiction i really dug the nonaction oriented scifi weve heard from many teachers that they used episodes of star trek and concepts of star trek in their science classrooms in order to engage the students science fiction was never my thing i have no interest in it i dont really see science fiction as fiction i can imagine colonies on mars and everything and i have lived since  as you have  in a period of cold war during which we have ensured by our achievements in the science and technology of destruction that a third act in this tragedy of war will result in the peace of extinction from all this it follows what the general character of the problem of the development of a body of scientific knowledge is in so far as it depends on elements internal to science itself my training in science of mind had begun with my mother she took me to a different church every sunday and she encouraged me to question the minister afterward i was raised on comic books and i love science fiction i like science fiction and physics things like that planets being sucked into black holes and the various vortexes that create possibility and what happens on the other side of the black hole to me its the microcosmic study of the macrocosmic universe in man and thats why im attracted to it pure phenomenology claims to be the science of pure phenomena this concept of the phenomenon which was developed under various names as early as the eighteenth century without being clarified is what we shall have to deal with first of all i do enjoy reading some science fiction i was always attracted to science fiction movies we sat around on a hotel balcony with a bottle of wine and tried to figure out how you would go about blowing up a planet thats the kind of conversations science fiction writers have when they get together we dont talk about football or anything like that biology meaning the science of all life is a late notion there were certain questions about the foundations of morals that advances in science all threaten to make more complicated i would like to do a science fiction film some day star wars seems really to have destroyed the genre which at one time offered great musical opportunities cultural anthropology is more and more rapidly getting to realize itself as a strictly historical science science consistently produces a new crop of miraculous truths and dazzling devices every year science grows like a weed every year i was a daydreamer and there is a lot of history and geography and science i missed out on because i was in my head and i regret that i wanted to have a political career i thought studying political science would be the best way to achieve it im a geophysicist and all my earth science books when i was a student i had to give the wrong answer to get an a we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned of marshall kays geosynclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap psychology is the science of the act of experiencing and deals with the whole system of such acts as they make up mental life while most of us know that we feel better after a good hearty laugh science in many cases is yet to prove why the main purpose of science is simplicity and as we understand more things everything is becoming simpler science is the systematic classification of experience science is not addressed to poets science has produced such powerful weapons that in a war between great powers there would be neither victor nor vanquished both would be overwhelmed in destruction science may be described as the art of systematic oversimplification science must begin with myths and with the criticism of myths science is for those who learn poetry is for those who know ive started a company called tall girl productions and weve got our first project that is purely producing not writing with a writer named evan daugherty its for nbc its called afterthought and its science fictionish thats fun this is actually a very important principle that science is learning about large systems like evolution and that futurists are learning about anticipating human society just because a future scenario is plausible doesnt mean we can get there from here the rise of google the rise of facebook the rise of apple i think are proof that there is a place for computer science as something that solves problems that people face every day a second reason why science cannot replace judgement is the behavior of financial markets i cannot say how strongly i object to people using other peoples writing as research research is nonfiction especially for horror fantasy science fiction do not take your research from other peoples fiction just dont if margaret thatcher took climate change seriously and believed that we should take action to reduce global greenhouse emissions then taking action and supporting and accepting the science can hardly be the mark of incipient bolshevism science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence christmas renews our youth by stirring our wonder the capacity for wonder has been called our most pregnant human faculty for in it are born our art our science our religion i began reading science fiction before i was 12 and started writing science fiction around the same time science fiction let me do both it let me look into science and stick my nose in everywhere the thing about science fiction is that its totally wide open but its wide open in a conditional way fantasy is totally wide open all you really have to do is follow the rules youve set but if youre writing about science you have to first learn what youre writing about no one was going to stop me from writing and no one had to really guide me towards science fiction it was natural really that i would take that interest so fantasy was fine early on and when i discovered science fiction i was very happy with it because my first interest in science fiction came with an interest in astronomy i was attracted to science fiction because it was so wide open i was able to do anything and there were no walls to hem you in and there was no human condition that you were stopped from examining i told my father i had to try political science for a year he thought i was throwing my life away one of the things that ultimately led me to leave mathematics and go into political science was thinking i could prevent nuclear war science has sometimes been said to be opposed to faith and inconsistent with it but all science in fact rests on a basis of faith for it assumes the permanence and uniformity of natural laws  a thing which can never be demonstrated for a member to say im a lame duck violates political science 101 with science fiction theres endless possibilities science fiction is becoming more of a diverse kind of genre the science of life is changing hearts and minds in science there is only physics all the rest is stamp collecting ah the creative process is the same secret in science as it is in art they are all the same absolutely were looking at earth science observing our planet also space science looking at the ozone in the atmosphere around our earth also looking at life science and on a human level using ourselves as test subjects i decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms there are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people from making use of ones contributions to computer science people think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite just many people doing things that build on eachother like a wall of mini stones i think if im going to do a science fiction im going to go down a new path that i want to do science makes no pretension to eternal truth or absolute truth science is an integral part of culture its not this foreign thing done by an arcane priesthood its one of the glories of the human intellectual tradition i dont think academic writing ever was wonderful however science used to be much less specialized goethe died in 1832 as you know goethe was very active in science in fact he did some very good scientific work in plant morphology and mineralogy but he was quite bitter at the way in which many scientists refused to grant him a hearing because he was a poet and therefore they felt he couldnt be serious science is not a heartless pursuit of objective information it is a creative human activity its geniuses acting more as artists than as information processors my entry into the environmental arena was through the issue that so dramatically  and destructively  demonstrates the link between science and social action nuclear weapons the age of innocent faith in science and technology may be over psychology is the science of the intellects characters and behavior of animals including man i didnt invent forensic science and medicine i just was one of the first people to recognize how interesting it is science is always inquiring i felt strongly that since the pursuit of good science was so difficult it was essential that the problem being studied was an important one to justify the effort expanded i have an idealistic view of science as a liberalising and progressive force for humanity i think it was this curiosity about the natural world which awoke my early interest in science like many students i found the drudgery of real experiments and the slowness of progress a complete shock and at my low points i contemplated other alternative careers including study of the philosophy or sociology of science in the spirit of science there really is no such thing as a failed experiment any test that yields valid data is a valid test thats the show its like 5 minutes of science and then 10 minutes of me hurting myself we didnt set out to be educators or even scientists and we dont purport that what we do is real science but were demonstrating a methodology by which one can engage and satisfy your curiosity rationalism and newtonian science has lured us into dark woods but a new metaphysics can rescue us most modern science fiction went to school on dune even harry potter with its boy protagonist who has not yet grown into his destiny shares a common theme when i read it for the first time i felt like i had learned another language mastered a new culture adopted a new religion fruitful discourse in science or theology requires us to believe that within the contexts of normal discourse there are some true statements i believe very strongly and have fought since many years ago  at least over 30 years ago  to get architecture not just within schools but architecture talked about under history geography science technology art in poland my audience is all women between 18 and 30 at us conventions you have the fantasy and science fiction crowd at harvard you have an entirely different audience its so schizophrenic in teaching man experimental science results in lessening his pride more and more by proving to him every day that primary causes like the objective reality of things will be hidden from him forever and that he can only know relations experimentation is an active science science does not permit exceptions the most exciting thing in the twentieth century is science young people ask me if this country is serious about science they arent thinking about the passport that they will hold but the country that they must rely on for support and encouragement when as we must often do we fear science we really fear ourselves science never gives up searching for truth since it never claims to have achieved it it is this at its most basic that makes science a humane pursuit it acknowledges the commonality of peoples experience though neglectful of their responsibility to protect science scientists are increasingly aware of their responsibility to society science gives us a powerful vocabulary and it is impossible to produce a vocabulary with which one can only say nice things better to die in the pursuit of civilized values we believed than in a flight underground we were offering a value system couched in the language of science today academies of science use their influence around the world in support of human rights the respect for human rights essential if we are to use technology wisely is not something alien that must be grafted onto science on the contrary it is integral to science as also to scholarship in general for science must breathe the oxygen of freedom science exists moreover only as a journey toward troth stifle dissent and you end that journey while that amendment failed human cloning continues to advance and the breakthrough in this unethical and morally questionable science is around the corner mothers unless they were very poor didnt work both of my parents had to leave education my mother had to work in a cotton mill until 18 or 19 when she took some training in domestic science as a theoretical physicist i feel at once proud and humble at the thought of the illustrious figures that have preceded me here to receive the greatest of all honors in science the nobel prize you know there was a time just before i started to study physical science when astronomers thought that systems such as we have here in the solar system required a rare triple collision of stars science and vision are not opposites or even at odds they need each other i sometimes hear other startup folks say something along the lines of if entrepreneurship was a science then anyone could do it id like to point out that even science is a science and still very few people can do it let alone do it well except in very narrow cases where theres breakthrough science that needs patent production worrying about competitors is a waste of time if you cant out iterate someone who is trying to copy you youre toast anyway perfect as the wing of a bird may be it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air facts are the air of science without them a man of science can never rise todays preoccupation with physical theories of everything takes a wrong turn from the purpose of science  to question all things relentlessly modern physics has become like swifts kingdom of laputa flying absurdly on an island above the earth and indifferent to what is beneath amazingly when you add life and consciousness to the equation you can actually explain some of the biggest puzzles of science i think its science and physics are just starting to learn from all these experiments these experiments have been carried out hundreds and hundreds of times in all sorts of ways that no physicist really questions the end point i think that these experiments are very clearly telling us that consciousness is limitless and the ultimate reality fashion is more about feel than science in some parts of life like mathematics and science yeah i was a genius i would top all the top scores you could ever measure it by research is of considerable importance in certain fields such as science and history the east germans first used biomechanics this meant that rather than guessing about technique and form they could apply changes to athletic performance based on science to recover a spiritual tradition in which creation and the study of creation matters would be to inaugurate new possibilities between spirituality and science that would shape the paradigms for culture its institution and its people invented languages have often been created in tandem with entire invented universes and most conlangers come to their craft by way of fantasy and science fiction advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for australians is one of the highest in the world science fiction encourages us to explore all the futures good and bad that the human mind can envision i became kind of a dropout in science after i came back to america i wanted to photograph you see i became kind of a dropout in science after i came back to america politics is the science of urgencies science is knowledge arranged and classified according to truth facts and the general laws of nature thousands of years ago humans domesticated every possible large wild mammal species fulfilling all those criteria and worth domesticating with the result that there have been no valuable additions of domestic animals in recent times despite the efforts of modern science tasmanian history is a study of human isolation unprecedented except in science fiction  namely complete isolation from other humans for 10000 years were uncomfortable about considering history as a science its classified as a social science which is considered not quite scientific he that desireth to acquire any art or science seeketh first those means by which that art or science is obtained if we ought to do so in things natural and earthly how much more then in spiritual i shopped at j crew in high school i studied computer science i was a nerdnerd now im a musicnerd it seems true that the growth of science and secularism made organized christianity feel under threat evolutionary naturalism takes the inherent limitations of science and turns them into a devastating philosophical weapon because science is our only real way of knowing anything what science cannot know cannot be real theres a new science out called orthomolecular medicine you correct the chemical imbalance with amino acids and vitamins and minerals that are naturally in the body in general science journalism concerns itself with what has been published in a handful of peerreviewed journals  nature cell the new england journal of medicine  which set the agenda the big journals and nobel laureates are the equivalent of congressional leaders in science journalism until politics are a branch of science we shall do well to regard political and social reforms as experiments rather than shortcuts to the millennium there can be no truce between science and religion and if we must educate our poets and artists in science we must educate our masters labour and capital in art science fiction is trying to find alternative ways of looking at realities my point has always been that ever since the industrial revolution science fiction has been the most important genre there is a lot of what the culture is about is a reaction to all the science fiction i was reading in my very early teens i think a lot of people are frightened of technology and frightened of change and the way to deal with something youre frightened of is to make fun of it thats why science fiction fans are dismissed as geeks and nerds science fiction has its own history its own legacy of whats been done whats been superseded whats so much part of the furniture its practically part of the fabric now whats become no more than a joke and so on its just plain foolish as well as comically arrogant to ignore all this to fail to do the most basic research but because we live in an age of science we have a preoccupation with corroborating our myths sound science must be our guide in choosing which problems to tackle and how to approach them when i got my phd it was a time when there were just no jobs for phds period phds were getting the lowest paid technician jobs if they were lucky in any kind of science the science for which the united states is respected has nothing to do with the unscientific and baseless theory of evolution evolution is the fundamental idea in all of life science  in all of biology science is a wonderful discipline to which we are deeply indebted science fiction has a way of letting you talk about where we are in the world and letting you be a bit of a pop philosopher without being didactic i didnt understand how you could be an actor if you didnt also study philosophy and study political science astronomy and also just go out and live life and have experiences much of indian science seems intuitive and not bound by the rigid thinking of classical scientists i hope every woman out there who wants to be a mother and is suffering with infertility will explore all the options and know that if you choose the science route it is okay our work on light bulbs wasnt an arbitrary mandate we didnt just pick a standard out of the air or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility instead we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable some ideas you have to chew on then roll them around a lot play with them before you can turn them into funky science fiction i would love to photograph stephen hawking i am just fascinated by science i really am science goes from question to question big questions and little tentative answers the questions as they age grow ever broader the answers are seen to be more limited paleoanthropology is not a science that ends with the discovery of a bone one has to have the original to work with it is a lifelong task i developed that for a long time i also developed sugar sweet science at new line and that didnt happen that was a boxing movie and between all that there were a couple of other things in science all facts no matter how trivial or banal enjoy democratic equality theres a lot of interesting words nomenclatures in science my political science degree is always on the backburner i took my lsat so even if i want to take the lsat again i know what im getting into ill keep it on the backburner who knows maybe with my popularity i can have a career in politics with a law degree i think itll work out either way science and literature give me answers and they ask me questions i will never be able to answer nothing matters but the facts without them the science of criminal investigation is nothing more than a guessing game modem science then maintains on the one hand that nature both organic and inorganic strives towards a state of order and that mans actions are governed by the same tendency if on occasion the knowledge brought by science leads to an unhappy end this is not to the discredit of science but is rather an indication of an imperfect ability to use wisely the gifts placed within our hands great moments in science einstein discovers that time is actually money comedy is very hard but you have to learn the art and science of it if i wasnt doing this id be in school studying political science or socioeconomic something i love visiting different cultures and finding out how they make up a society i wanted to be a political science professor and go to school in boston i never wanted to be a big famous movie star and tv star it kind of found me the science of boobytrapping has taken a good deal of the fun out of following hot on the enemys heels i think what a life in science really teaches you is the vastness of our ignorance without renouncing the support of physics it is possible for the physiology of the senses not only to pursue its own course of development but also to afford to physical science itself powerful assistance ive always loved 3d in fact as a kid i was exposed to 3d at an early age because my grandfather was a specialist of 3d in cinematheques and then my cousin put it in science of sleep with toilet paper tube cities but he was a specialist and i always wanted to do something in 3d we tried war we tried aggression we tried intervention none of it works why dont we try peace as a science of human relations not as some vague notion  as everyday work gender consciousness has become involved in almost every intellectual field history literature science anthropology theres been an extraordinary advance i think the perception of there being a deep gulf between science and the humanities is false im writing a review of three books on feminism and science and its about social constructionism so i would say im a social constructionist whatever that means now venus is an extremely hostile environment and as such presents a lot of challenges for a science fiction author who wants to create life there however as i began to research it more thoroughly i found myself intrigued by the possibilities the world offers when we see the shadow on our images are we seeing the time 11 minutes ago on mars or are we seeing the time on mars as observed from earth now its like time travel problems in science fiction when is now when was then hgh testing is happening in olympics the science is there it is a valid test one of the reasons i did this because i wasnt really looking for another science fiction film was that my daughter can see it shes 9 and its really a good film for all ages by exploring the political and moral colorings of discoveries about what makes us tick we can have a more honest science and a less fearful intellectual milieu dont confuse hypothesis and theory the former is a possible explanation the latter the correct one the establishment of theory is the very purpose of science facts are not science  as the dictionary is not literature in the sick room ten cents worth of human understanding equals ten dollars worth of medical science science fiction outside of poetry is the only literary field which has no limits no parameters whatsoever in science fiction you can also test out your own realities i wrote the very first stories in science fiction which dealt with homosexuality the world well lost and affair with a green monkey in the forensic science course i took at university they used photographs of dead bodies for ballistics they showed us a guy lying on the floor and his head had burst my personal conviction is that science is concerned wholly with truth not with ethics i would be more frightened as a writer if people thought my movies were like science fiction but the imposition of morality onto science  where it does not belong  has become rampant in recent years winning is the science of being totally prepared ive always been a big fan of science fiction and of the worlds of the spiritual and the mystic and i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction especially apocalyptic and postapocalyptic fiction im really convinced that our descendants a century or two from now will look back at us with the same pity that we have toward the people in the field of science two centuries ago the origin of life is one of the great outstanding mysteries of science in science a healthy skepticism is a professional necessity whereas in religion having belief without evidence is regarded as a virtue science we are repeatedly told is the most reliable form of knowledge about the world because it is based on testable hypotheses religion by contrast is based on faith the term doubting thomas well illustrates the difference a permanent base on mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology if as some evidence suggests exotic microorganisms have arisen independently of terrestrial life studying them could revolutionise biology medicine and biotechnology for me science is already fantastical enough unlocking the secrets of nature with fundamental physics or cosmology or astrobiology leads you into a wonderland compared with which beliefs in things like alien abductions pale into insignificance though we do need more women to graduate with technical degrees i always like to remind women that you dont need to have science or technology degrees to build a career in tech is there anything science should not try to explain science is knowledge and knowledge is power  power to do good or evil sometimes ignorance is bliss cosmologists have attempted to account for the daytoday laws you find in textbooks in terms of fundamental superlaws but the superlaws themselves must still be accepted as brute facts so maybe the ultimate laws of nature will always be offlimits to science traditionally scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply given elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth and fixed thereafter inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science the birth of science as we know it arguably began with isaac newtons formulation of the laws of gravitation and motion it is no exaggeration to say that physics was reborn in the early 20thcentury with the twin revolutions of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity a man ceases to be a beginner in any given science and becomes a master in that science when he has learned that he is going to be a beginner all his life i got to spend all of my time every day at work reading and editing papers about cuttingedge technical research and getting paid for it then id go home at night and turn what i learned into science fiction stories i wanted the feel in these books to be like an epic fantasy with kings queens dukes and court politics but of course like what i was explaining before about making the science make sense you have to make the politics make sense too dune is the bestselling science fiction book of all time its something you really need to read in your lifetime if youre going to read the lord of the rings which everyone should then you have to read dune too we especially need imagination in science one of the problems weve had is that the ict curriculum in the past has been written for a subject that is changing all the time i think that what we should have is computer science in the future  and how it fits in to the curriculum is something we need to be talking to scientists to experts in coding and to young people about we need to be proscience we have to go back to science the thing that interests me least about the radio business is the radio business but ive had to learn a little bit about it its not rocket science you get ratings thats good it turns out that understanding the british public is not rocket science the british appreciate honesty and they also have a bonkers offthewall sense of humour like me if you just have a single problem to solve then fine go ahead and use a neural network but if you want to do science and understand how to choose architectures or how to go to a new problem you have to understand what different architectures can and cannot do science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species it is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are i think understanding how the universe was born is very important it really gives us a perspective on many things from my earliest acquaintance with the science of political economy it has been evident to my mind that capital was the product of labor and that therefore in its best analysis there could be no natural conflict between capital and labor many writers upon the science of political economy have declared that it is the duty of a nation first to encourage the creation of wealth and second to direct and control its distribution all such theories are delusive when i was younger i wanted to be a big movie star whod get to be funny on talk shows and then i wanted to retire and write science fiction science already contained all that was necessary if you just brought it out and i thought i would just share with you what science says today about silicone breast implants if you have them youre healthier than if you dont in fact theres no science that shows that silicone breast implants are detrimental and in fact they make you healthier intelligence is not a science i certainly saw science as a kind of calling and one with as much legitimacy as a religious calling i did get a very fine education and not just in science it took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that i really should take an interest in humanities i hope ive lived a life of science whose style will encourage younger people id like to put in a vote for the intrinsic fascination of science im chairing a unesco committee on how to improve global internet communications for science help thirdworld people get onto the net so they can be part of the process the general public has long been divided into two parts those who think science can do anything and those who are afraid it will music is not math its science you keep mixing the stuff up until it blows up on you or it becomes this incredible potion english once accepted as an international language is no more secure than french has proved to be as the one and only accepted language of diplomacy or as latin has proved to be as the international language of science the modern mind tends to be more and more critical and analytical in spirit hence it must devise for itself an engine of expression which is logically defensible at every point and which tends to correspond to the rigorous spirit of modern science i think of it as a good opportunity to let in particular school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science and that its not just for a select group of people usually girls werent encouraged to go to college and major in math and science my high school calculus teacher ms paz jensen made math appealing and motivated me to continue studying it in college as a kid i wanted to write science fiction and i was never without a book later i really got into being a scientist and never thought id be writing novels science has not been successful by making up explanations of things that fit with the current social fabric science rests on reason and experiment and can meet an opponent with calmness but a belief is always sensitive the man of science is nothing if not a poet gone wrong a successful society is characterized by a rising living standard for its population increasing investment in factories and basic infrastructure and the generation of additional surplus which is invested in generating new discoveries in science and technology as a child i read science fiction but from the very beginnings of my reading for pleasure i read a lot of nonfictional history particularly historical biography i dont dare postulate about science but i know that it takes both emotion and intellect in order for art to happen todays recording techniques would have been regarded as science fiction forty years ago a person that much interested in science is going to neglect his social life somewhat but not completely because that isnt healthy either so one has to work it out according to ones own inclinations how one wants to proportion these things unfortunately a lot of the concepts in the bible are based on ancient mythology that doesnt fit the findings of science i went to college at the university of kansas where i got a degree in political science the virtues of science are skepticism and independence of thought the conscious purpose of science is control of nature its unconscious effect is disruption and chaos so my degree was in political science which i think was  the closest i could come to marketing is politics in order for america to remain a global leader in innovation and opportunity we must give our children a solid foundation in math and science in the last fifty years science has advanced more than in the 2000 previous years and given mankind greater powers over the forces of nature than the ancients ascribed to their gods as i have tried to show science in producing the airplane and the wireless has created a new international political environment to which governments must adjust their foreign policies i was born in 1950 and watched science fiction and horror movies on tv and was always really fascinated by them i do not think we are ever going to be able to for a long time get the kind of quality of school personnel that we need in our schools especially in the areas of science and math one of the answers to that problem is to use more educational technology science has everything to say about what is possible science has nothing to say about what is permissible first i think the science of monetary economics has clearly gotten better and finally no matter how good the science gets there are problems that inevitably depend on judgement on art on a feel for financial markets i love science fiction ive tried to be a straight scientist doing the science and reporting it as best i can you have no time to do the science if youre talking to the media what has become clear from the science is that we cannot burn all of the fossil fuels without creating a very different planet as a microbiologist i am particularly concerned with mr bushs blatant disregard for science at a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role and conduct themselves accordingly but the first the general public learned about the discovery was the news of the destruction of hiroshima by the atom bomb a splendid achievement of science and technology had turned malign science became identified with death and destruction from my earliest days i had a passion for science i did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science i saw science as being in harmony with humanity indeed the whole human species is endangered by nuclear weapons or by other means of wholesale destruction which further advances in science are likely to produce truth is i dont think god on a daily basis i think politics science when im not writing i read loads of fiction but ive been writing quite constantly lately so ive been reading a lot of nonfiction  philosophy religion science history social or cultural studies science is defined in various ways but today it is generally restricted to something which is experimental which is repeatable which can be predicted and which is falsifiable the science is clear that there is an increase in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere what is not clear from the science is how much of that increase is caused by human activity and what also is not clear is what impact those increases have on the climatic cycle in science read by preference the newest works in literature read the oldest the classics are always modern oh im nerdy about science fiction and fantasy and graphic novels and reading and im nerdy about board games my favorite board game is a board game im working on right now its a game of napoleonic era naval warfare and its going to be fun this is a global fight to get the right people in the right place and were talking about people with phds in engineering computer science mathematics certainly going back to sherlock holmes we have a tradition of forensic science featured in detective stories weapons of mass destruction arent pulled out of a black hat like a white rabbit at a magic show theyre produced in factories theres science and technology involved theyre not produced in a hole in the ground or in a basement the world is my country science is my religion science is not about control it is about cultivating a perpetual condition of wonder in the face of something that forever grows one step richer and subtler than our latest theory about it it is about reverence not mastery i think that if the novels task is to describe where we find ourselves and how we live now the novelist must take a good hard look at the most central facts of contemporary life  technology and science i really like science because it seems to be that place where you get the big picture everything connects i was a science fiction junkie for a long time unfortunately climate science has become political science it is tragic that some perhaps wellmeaning but politically motivated scientists who should know better have whipped up a global frenzy about a phenomena which is statistically questionable at best when i started in the business there was a thing called adult fantasy but nobody quite knew what it was and most publishers didnt have an adult fantasy list they had science fiction lists which they stuck a little bit of fantasy into i grew up a red sox fan i grew up going to fenway park and the museum of fine arts and the science museum and symphony hall and going to the common walking around my whole family at different times lived and worked in boston science fiction readers probably have the gene for novelty and seem to enjoy a cascade of invention as much as a writer enjoys providing one even if you only want to write science fiction you should also read mysteries poetry mainstream literature history biography philosophy and science we asked ourselves and the world to base decisions on good science and i really believe the united states can be the leader in delivering that message to our international trading partners the goal is to normalize trade relations based on sound science and consumer protection science is the international language so when we are able to convince countries that good decisionmaking for human health and animal health is based upon science thats a real success story for us in beef trade issues we base our decisions upon science when i was born in 1970 with a rare genetic disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita sed medical science wasnt what it is today and my mum and dad were treated terribly by the medical profession beyond that i seem to be compelled to write science fiction rather than fantasy or mysteries or some other genre more likely to climb onto bestseller lists even though i enjoy reading a wide variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction however i wasnt very good at the sciences or didnt have a lot of help in the sciences or something but certainly didnt set science for my a level and when i came to take my a levels i didnt get a good enough result to go to university i would argue that the issue of god and the issue of science have the same roots the time was not yet ripe for the growth of mathematical science among us and any development that might have taken place in that direction was rudely stopped by the civil war one hardly knows where in the history of science to look for an important movement that had its effective start in so pure and simple an accident as that which led to the building of the great washington telescope and went on to the discovery of the satellites of mars it was generally believed that catholics were not interested in arts and science graduate schools they werent going to be intellectuals and so i put the theses to the test and they all collapsed its such a long mission and we get to spend so much time in space were doing such exciting research and i dont want to overemphasize the life science research but as a physician the life science research that were doing is extremely exciting life science research can be done on multiple platforms since we have a very small number of people flying into space the more people you have the better science for hundreds of years has spanned the differences between cultures and between countries computer science is embarrassed by the computer art is made to disturb science reassures american high school students trail teenagers from 14 european and asian countries in reading math and science were even trailing france dont you see whats at stake here the ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space the greatest mystery is right here right under our feet science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer art is everything else we do people who love science fiction really do love sex im from the madeleine lengle school the more she delves into science the more she knows theres a creator whos behind these amazing laws these amazing events the symmetry of nature the structure and order of it i was on the football team because i wanted to experience the different iconic social classes of high school so football for me was an attempt to socially integrate in an interesting way and then i didnt like it anymore and stopped doing it and focused more on drama and science and other forms of art and music i dont think immortality is necessarily the key to understanding the world you have to be careful with what you think youre achieving im all for science discovering amazing and fantastic things about our world but i think the motivations behind it are slightly askew science and art or by the same token poetry and prose differ from one another like a journey and an excursion the purpose of the journey is its goal the purpose of an excursion is the process neither science nor the politics in power nor the mass media nor business nor the law nor even the military are in a position to define or control risks rationally people challenge my nerd cred all the time i just show them the photo of me winning my middleschool science fair wearing my casio calculator watch and eyeglasses so big they look like they can see the future it is not enough to know your craft  you have to have feeling science is all very well but for us imagination is worth far more i was sent to a finishing school which didnt last long when mother found out how badly chaperoned we were then i came out before going to a domestic science school i think there is a tendency in science to measure what is measurable and to decide that what you cannot measure must be uninteresting its very strange writing science fiction in a world that moves as fast as ours does i really like being pregnant not that there arent things i dont love but when i think about what my body is doing  creating a child  it just blows my mind im in awe of the process and science tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations in politics perhaps even in business in science only one thing matters and that is the facts anthropologists are a connecting link between poets and scientists though their fieldwork among primitive peoples has often made them forget the language of science im not being evasive but i am saying im not a scientist and im not directly involved in the consultation however the science must be sound it must be agreed and the consultation must be of a high quality or no one will have any confidence in the process theres a science to ordering potatoes are they skinny shoestring or big fat steak fries you just have to let your taste buds guide you when deciding what to eat i sort of feel that climate change will be solved by science i just feel instinctively that we will find a way of saving ourselves but i am less confident that we wont destroy ourselves in other ways i think the reason people are dealing with science less well now than 50 years ago is that it has become so complicated science moves with the spirit of an adventure characterized both by youthful arrogance and by the belief that the truth once found would be simple as well as pretty science has always been my preoccupation and when you think a breakthrough is possible it is terribly exciting were not all equal its simply not true that isnt science sure science involves trial and error scientists refine theories each day but as they do they help us grasp more clearly the wonders of the world and the universe that said id does not qualify as science because it gives us nothing to test or measure science requires replicable tests involving measurable variables architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences and adorned with much and varied learning by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts perhaps to the uninformed it may appear unaccountable that a man should be able to retain in his memory such a variety of learning but the close alliance with each other of the different branches of science will explain the difficulty harmony is an obscure and difficult musical science but most difficult to those who are not acquainted with the greek language because it is necessary to use many greek words to which there are none corresponding in latin i have to do more close research and fact checking for the science fiction this is not however to say that writing good fantasy does not involve doing good research it is a shock to us in the twentieth century to discover from observations science has made that the fundamental mechanisms of life cannot be ascribed to natural selection and therefore were designed but we must deal with our shock as best we can and go on im mostly a novelist these days but i have written short stories in fantasy science fiction and horror it is often said that science must avoid any conclusions which smack of the supernatural global warming it is a hoax it is bad science it is highjacking public policy it is the greatest scam in history it was a shock to people of the nineteenth century when they discovered from observations science had made that many features of the biological world could be ascribed to the elegant principle of natural selection im not a great science fiction fan myself i probably feel that way about westerns like i used to play cowboys and indians they can act out will and the robot science is not a game in which arbitrary rules are used to decide what explanations are to be permitted the theory of undirected evolution is already dead but the work of science continues science is a selfsufficient activity the thing about science is that its an accurate picture of the world in praising science it does not follow that we must adopt the very poor philosophies which scientific men have constructed in philosophy they have much more to learn than to teach theres no doubt that scientific training helps many authors to write better science fiction and yet several of the very best were english majors who could not parse a differential equation to save their lives predicting has a spotty record in science fiction ive had some failures on the other hand i also predicted the fall of the berlin wall and the rise of fundamentalist islam and im not happy to be right in all of those cases change is the principal feature of our age and literature should explore how people deal with it the best science fiction does that headon but honestly if you do a rigorous survey of my work ill bet youll find that biology is a theme far more often than physical science one of the first rules of science is if somebody delivers a secret weapon to you you better use it the proper study of mankind is the science of design carl took on the militaryindustrial complex he campaigned around the world for an end to the production of weapons of mass destruction to him it was a perversion of science questions have arisen about the policing of science who is responsible for the policing my answer is all of us modern science then so far from being an enemy of romance is seen on every hand to be its sympathetic and resourceful friend its swift and irresistible helper in its serious need and an indulgent minister to its lighter fancies we need to tap the resource of current and retiring science and math professionals that have both content mastery and the practical experience to serve as effective teachers today over half of chinas undergraduate degrees are in math science technology and engineering yet only 16 percent of americas undergraduates pursue these schools math and science fields are not the only areas where we see the united states lagging behind less than 1 percent of american high school students study the critical foreign languages of arabic chinese japanese korean or russian combined i dont read other science fiction i dont read any at all but roy rockwood it was science fiction for the sake of science fiction we must be willing to pay inspiring math and science teachers who have high paying alternatives in industry more to teach and reward students who take more challenging courses in high school with science fiction i think we are preparing ourselves for contact with them whoever they may be the old testament is my favourite science fantasy reading fashion is the science of appearances and it inspires one with the desire to seem rather than to be i dig science fiction though it was never really my thing research and development needs permanent tax credits to build the technology that spurs our growth but no government programs alone can get americas students to study more science and math parents must push and help their children to meet this goal in europe art has to a large degree taken the place of religion in america it seems rather to be science i had never seen much of star trek or any other science fiction before i was cast but sevens wonderful but man has still another powerful resource natural science with its strictly objective methods sound science must be a basis to governing our trade relations around the globe on the other hand the waging of peace as a science as an art is in its infancy but we can trace its growth its steady progress and the time will come when there will be particular individuals designated to assume responsibility for and leadership of this movement i have been a reader of science fiction and fantasy for a long time since i was 11 or 12 i think so i understand it and im not at all surprised that readers of the genre might enjoy my books we have long possessed the art of war and the science of war which have been evolved in the minutest detail of the two i would think of my work as closer to science fiction than fantasy brian and i were both science students you know science sort of math and physics side you know science fiction is not just about the future of space ships travelling to other planets it is fiction based on science and i am using science as my basis for my fiction but its the science of prehistory  palaeontology and archaeology  rather than astronomy or physics every science is a profane restatement of the preceding dogmas of the religious period i have heard science fiction and fantasy referred to as the fiction of ideas and i like that definition but its the mainstream public that chooses my books for the most part i quite enjoy science fiction my fiction is reviewed by the mainstream press by science fiction periodicals romance magazines small press publications and various other journals including some usually devoted to archaeological and other science material theres a big overlap with the people you meet at the fantasy and science fiction cons i could write historical fiction or science fiction or a mystery but since i find it fascinating to research the clues of some little know period and develop a story based on that i will probably continue to do it i finally decided one day reading science fiction magazines of the time i could do at least as well as some of these people are doing so i finally made a serious effort i love having my hands in the dirt it is never a science and always an art there are no rules and if it comes down to me versus that weed im trying to pull out of the ground that doesnt want to come out i know ill win the geezer album black science had a lot of keyboards and it did not work i like to browse in occult bookshops if for no other reason than to refresh my commitment to science even in our day science suspects beyond the polar seas at the very circle of the arctic pole the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which is ever green when i did battlestar galactica it was the first time i really understood science fiction that was a very political drama but set in spaceships so people didnt really take it seriously but some really fascinating things were explored in that science consists exactly of those forms of knowledge that can be verified and duplicated by anybody of course not everybodys willing to go out and do the experiments but for the people who are willing to go out and do that  if the experiments dont work then it means its not science instead of having to be a member of the royal society to do science the way you had to be in england in the 17th 18th centuries today pretty much anybody who wants to do it can and the information that they need to do it is there in this time of budget cuts we cannot forget that basic science is a building block for scientific innovation and economic growth in the information age nevertheless as is a frequent occurrence in science a general hypothesis was constructed from a few specific instances of a phenomenon when i was a kid i loved the curse of frankenstein the creeping unknown x the unknown i love forbidden planet the thing from another world they were science fictionhorror movies generally fracking is doable if theres full disclosure of all chemicals used secondly science dictates the policy rather than politics third theres collaboration between environmental groups and the natural gas industry that the way to achieve higher standards of living for all is through science and technology taking advantage of better tools methods and organization 1988 i also received from the city of vienna the cross of honour for art and science these titles and the various honors mean a great deal to me most of all for the reason that they would mean a great deal to my parents too i think junior is certainly a science fiction premise as is twins as is dave beyond ghostbusters id always been a science fiction enthusiast ive always been a fan of science fiction films and ive never been able to put my particular spin on it galileo was no idiot only an idiot could believe that science requires martyrdom  that may be necessary in religion but in time a scientific result will establish itself how thoroughly it is ingrained in mathematical science that every real advance goes hand in hand with the invention of sharper tools and simpler methods which at the same time assist in understanding earlier theories and in casting aside some more complicated developments the further a mathematical theory is developed the more harmoniously and uniformly does its construction proceed and unsuspected relations are disclosed between hitherto separated branches of the science mathematical science is in my opinion an indivisible whole an organism whose vitality is conditioned upon the connection of its parts i read popular mechanics popular science readers digest i read some responsible journalism and from that i form my own opinions i also happen to be intelligent and i question everything id always wanted the show to be more reality based science fiction something along the lines of the day the earth stood still which i consider to be the classic science fiction film math is sometimes called the science of patterns i felt that chess is a science in the form of a game i consider myself a scientist i wanted to be treated like a scientist i believe that science fiction is as profound as you want it to be or it can be very simple entertainment and im all for very simple entertainment every now and then we all need to come home vegout watch something and not think too deeply about it its what you want it to be we tend to steer clear of being pedantic its entertainment first otherwise wed be on a lecture circuit it does not just happen it is disclosed by science that practically onehalf of trained intellectual resources are being mobilized for murderous purposes there are so many stories to tell in the worlds of science fiction the worlds of fantasy and horror that to confine yourself to even doing historical revisionist fiction whatever you want to call it  mashups gimmick lit absurdist fiction  i dont know if i want to do that anymore we in science are spoiled by the success of mathematics mathematics is the study of problems so simple that they have good solutions if you publish a scientific paper it is very hard to start a nationwide debate about something if you do this in a movie you can start a debate we like to create a bridge between those two worlds  film and science so one reason the science educators panic at the first sign of public rebellion is that they fear exposure of the implicit religious content in what they are teaching as it turns out what looks like science sometimes is not some theists in evolutionary science acquiesce to these tacit rules and retain a personal faith while accepting a thoroughly naturalistic picture of physical reality science is based on the possibility of objectivity on the possibility of different people checking out for themselves the observations made by others without that possibility there is no empirical principle capable of deciding between different arguments and theories in short it is not that evolutionary naturalists have been less brazen than the scientific creationists in holding science hostage but rather that they have been infinitely more effective in getting away with it science by itself has no moral dimension but it does seek to establish truth and upon this truth morality can be built no doubt it is true that science cannot study god but it hardly follows that god had to keep a safe distance from everything that scientists want to study the assumption that nature is all there is and that nature has been governed by the same rules at all times and places makes it possible for natural science to be confident that it can explain such things as how life began if modernist naturalism were true there would be no objective truth outside of science in that case right and wrong would be a matter of cultural preference or political power and the power already available to modernists ideologies would be overwhelming the problem with allowing god a role in the history of life is not that science would cease but rather that scientists would have to acknowledge the existence of something important which is outside the boundaries of natural science the monopoly of science in the realm of knowledge explains why evolutionary biologists do not find it meaningful to address the question whether the darwinian theory is true since coming to congress i have been advocating for increased resources for research in the physical sciences and for the department of energy office of science in particular as the nations primary supporter of research in the physical sciences the doe office of science led the way in creating a unique system of largescale specialized often oneofakind facilities for scientific discovery i meant exactly what i said that we are saddled with a culture that hasnt advanced as far as science scientific prayer makes god a celestial lab rat leading to bad science and worse religion but there is only one surefire method of proper pattern recognition and that is science anecdotal thinking comes naturally science requires training we know evolution happened because innumerable bits of data from myriad fields of science conjoin to paint a rich portrait of lifes pilgrimage but the power of science lies in open publication which with the rise of the internet is no longer constrained by the price of paper rocket science has been mythologized all out of proportion to its true difficulty there are relatively few science fiction or fantasy books with the main character being an old person i dislike literary jargon and never use it criticism has only one function and that is to help readers read and understand literature it is not a science it is an aid to art one of my degrees was a science degree in biology i was horrible at science and math i couldnt pass a test to save my life im surprised that it didnt take me until i was 20 to graduate thats why my role is so cool  grissom is the complete opposite of me my personal feeling about science fiction is that its always in some way connected to the real world to our everyday world we do a hard fantasy as well as hard science fiction and i think i probably singlehandedly recreated military science fiction it was dead before i started working in it it may be far in the future but theres some kind of logical way to get from where we are to where the science fiction is i started in this racket in the early 70s and when i was president of the science fiction writers of america of which i was like the sixth president i was the first one nobody ever heard of all the mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical laws and laws of numbers so that the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of nature to the determination of quantities by operations with numbers in my family as in most middleclass indian families i knew when i was growing up science and mathematics were held in awe weve established a washington state academy of sciences that will enable us to make decisions based on science about what is right for our state meaning the quality of our lives will get better i was really bright as a kid and tested well and it was clear that i was going to get scholarships to any schools i wanted my dad always said i could be an engineer at that time it was the elite of society steady job working in science which was then the answer to every problem we had it was kind of a mandate kind of a dream he had for me im crazy about grant his character his nature his science in fighting and everything else but i dont like the idea that he never accepted the blame for anything always found someone else to blame for any mistake that was ever made including blaming prentiss for shiloh if cooperation is thus the lifeblood of science and technology it is similarly vital to society as a whole theyve also asked me now to start on another series that were gonna do after this frontier earth but its not science fiction its more in the mystery and crime division and thats another area im very interested in human relations are built on feeling not on reason or knowledge and feeling is not an exact science like all spiritual qualities it has the vagueness of greatness about it science almost from its beginnings has been truly international in character national prejudices disappear completely in the scientists search for truth if you look at the purported dangers of salt or fat there is no consensus of support in scientific literature so i would ask first is it possible to have an informed government that actually follows the science from what ive seen its not likely i do love science fiction but its not really a genre unto itself it always seems to merge with another genre with the few movies ive done ive ended up playing with genre in some way or another so any genre thats made to mix with others is like candy to me it allows you to use big mythic situations to talk about ordinary things a third ideal that has made its way in the modern world is reliance on reason especially reason disciplined and enriched by modern science an eternal basis of human intercommunication is reason it is characteristic of science that the full explanations are often seized in their essence by the percipient scientist long in advance of any possible proof the recognition of the art that informs all pure science need not mean the abandonment for it of all present art rather it will mean the completion of the transformation of art that has already begun the relevance of marxism to science is that it removes it from its imagined position of complete detachment and shows it as a part but a critically important part of economy and social development we must always emphasize research and development of science and mathematics and i can think of no better way to achieve this than through our future in space science fiction is no more written for scientists that ghost stories are written for ghosts i sort of was good at writing essays i was never very good at mathematics and i was never very good at algebra i loved science but i wasnt sure of it whenever you deal with science fiction you are setting up a world of rules i think you work hard to establish the rules and you also have to work even harder to maintain those rules and within that find excitement and unpredictability and all that stuff in order to succeed your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure take up one idea make that one idea your life  think of it dream of it live on that idea let the brain muscles nerves every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone this is the way to success always be yourself express yourself have faith in yourself do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it a successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts think twice before you speak because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value i dont know the key to success but the key to failure is trying to please everybody always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed coming together is a beginning keeping together is progress working together is success dont aim for success if you want it just do what you love and believe in and it will come naturally the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather a lack of will success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome no man succeeds without a good woman behind him wife or mother if it is both he is twice blessed indeed strive not to be a success but rather to be of value formula for success rise early work hard strike oil formal education will make you a living selfeducation will make you a fortune if at first you dont succeed try try again then quit theres no point in being a damn fool about it develop success from failures discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success all you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure success is a lousy teacher it seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose i honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate action is the foundational key to all success to succeed in life you need two things ignorance and confidence failure is success if we learn from it what is success i think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing knowing that it is not enough that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose i dont measure a mans success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded it is no use saying we are doing our best you have got to succeed in doing what is necessary defeat is not the worst of failures not to have tried is the true failure success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something soon it becomes a reality act look feel successful conduct yourself accordingly and you will be amazed at the positive results a person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds success depends upon previous preparation and without such preparation there is sure to be failure success is not measured by what you accomplish but by the opposition you have encountered and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds frustration although quite painful at times is a very positive and essential part of success success is a science if you have the conditions you get the result the most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people whats money a man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do success is getting what you want happiness is wanting what you get as kids were not taught how to deal with success were taught how to deal with failure if at first you dont succeed try try again if at first you succeed then what winning isnt everything its the only thing belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture if everyone is moving forward together then success takes care of itself success comes from knowing that you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming if you have no critics youll likely have no success one secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes dont confuse fame with success madonna is one helen keller is the other i have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success it enables you to ignore the minor hurts the opponents pressure and the temporary failures the ladder of success is best climbed by stepping on the rungs of opportunity man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success success is simple do whats right the right way at the right time the successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way flaming enthusiasm backed up by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it failure is the key to success each mistake teaches us something happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort eighty percent of success is showing up in order to succeed you must fail so that you know what not to do the next time success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom the starting point of all achievement is desire in this world it is not what we take up but what we give up that makes us rich there is only one success  to be able to spend your life in your own way success isnt a result of spontaneous combustion you must set yourself on fire most people give up just when theyre about to achieve success they quit on the one yard line they give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown diligence is the mother of good fortune i couldnt wait for success so i went ahead without it if you want to achieve things in life youve just got to do them and if youre talented and smart youll succeed our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us thanks to the grace of god the best advice i know is to give is to give those worldly things your best but never your all  reserve the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it the greatest sign of success for a teacher is to be able to say the children are now working as if i did not exist the common idea that success spoils people by making them vain egotistic and selfcomplacent is erroneous on the contrary it makes them for the most part humble tolerant and kind the thermometer of success is merely the jealousy of the malcontents success is falling nine times and getting up ten if you wish to succeed in life make perseverance your bosom friend experience your wise counselor caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius success is dependent on effort they succeed because they think they can success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether it is the same problem you had last year success is blocked by concentrating on it and planning for it success is shy  it wont come out while youre watching its our nature human beings like success but they hate successful people success is the child of drudgery and perseverance it cannot be coaxed or bribed pay the price and it is yours definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement success in almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on intelligence this explains why we have so many stupid leaders failure is not an option everyone has to succeed success is the one unpardonable sin against our fellows success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed how can they say my life is not a success have i not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten after i won the oscar my salary doubled my friends tripled my children became more popular at school my butcher made a pass at me and my maid hit me up for a raise obedience is the mother of success and is wedded to safety success has a simple formula do your best and people may like it success is not a good teacher failure makes you humble sometimes i worry about being a success in a mediocre world success is that old abc  ability breaks and courage success is like death the more successful you become the higher the houses in the hills get and the higer the fences get those who have succeeded at anything and dont mention luck are kidding themselves success is the progressive realization of predetermined worthwhile personal goals the man who has done his level best is a success even though the world may write him down a failure nothing succeeds like success we fall forward to succeed success is simply a matter of luck ask any failure the toughest thing about success is that youve got to keep on being a success nothing recedes like success success is often the result of taking a misstep in the right direction the five essential entrepreneurial skills for success concentration discrimination organization innovation and communication success to me is having ten honeydew melons and eating only the top half of each slice success doesnt mean that you are healthy success doesnt mean that youre happy success doesnt mean that youre rested success really doesnt mean that you look good or feel good or are good its not enough that i should succeed  others should fail success is the space one occupies in the newspaper success is one days insolence the one phrase you can use is that success has a thousand fathers and failure is an orphan your success and happiness lies in you resolve to keep happy and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties my mother was the most beautiful woman i ever saw all i am i owe to my mother i attribute all my success in life to the moral intellectual and physical education i received from her character cannot be developed in ease and quiet only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened ambition inspired and success achieved we should measure welfares success by how many people leave welfare not by how many are added let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty the foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty character integrity faith love and loyalty put your heart mind and soul into even your smallest acts this is the secret of success the price of success is hard work dedication to the job at hand and the determination that whether we win or lose we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand there are no secrets to success it is the result of preparation hard work and learning from failure if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with success unexpected in common hours that some achieve great success is proof to all that others can achieve it as well israel was not created in order to disappear  israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom the size of your success is measured by the strength of your desire the size of your dream and how you handle disappointment along the way the only place success comes before work is in the dictionary patience persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success the secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you if you do that youre in control of your life if you dont life controls you if you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success i believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life you cant truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles before anything else preparation is the key to success it has always seemed strange to me the things we admire in men kindness and generosity openness honesty understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system and those traits we detest sharpness greed acquisitiveness meanness egotism and selfinterest are the traits of success and while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second a little more persistence a little more effort and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside before success comes in any mans life hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and perhaps some failures when defeat overtakes a man the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit thats exactly what the majority of men do its fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure like success failure is many things to many people with positive mental attitude failure is a learning experience a rung on the ladder a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again dictionary is the only place that success comes before work hard work is the price we must pay for success i think you can accomplish anything if youre willing to pay the price without continual growth and progress such words as improvement achievement and success have no meaning the supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity without it no real success is possible no matter whether it is on a section gang a football field in an army or in an office success is peace of mind which is a direct result of selfsatisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it for that determines our success or failure the way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it you are overcome by the fact because you think you are many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up success comes from taking the initiative and following up persisting eloquently expressing the depth of your love what simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life desire is the key to motivation but its determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal  a commitment to excellence  that will enable you to attain the success you seek success is like reaching an important birthday and finding youre exactly the same money and success dont change people they merely amplify what is already there i have learned that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours applause waits on success never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people  your family friends and coworkers and even strangers you meet along the way the best revenge is massive success the first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself the superior man makes the difficulty to be overcome his first interest success only comes later success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the same one a second time a true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success success makes so many people hate you i wish it wasnt that way it would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you money wont create success the freedom to make it will success has always been a great liar my definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain  and because of your lifestyle have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life  all areas of life the really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity you cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful we must walk consciously only part way toward our goal and then leap in the dark to our success success is steady progress toward ones personal goals success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it every day is a new opportunity you can build on yesterdays success or put its failures behind and start over again thats the way life is with a new game every day and thats the way baseball is the way a team plays as a whole determines its success you may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world but if they dont play together the club wont be worth a dime success is the result of perfection hard work learning from failure loyalty and persistence the secret to success is to offend the greatest number of people the only thing im addicted to is winning this bootleg cult arrogantly referred to as alcoholics anonymous reports a 5 percent success rate my success rate is 100 percent success is neither magical nor mysterious success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced every day successful people make money its not that people who make money become successful but that successful people attract money they bring success to what they do most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure discipline is the soul of an army it makes small numbers formidable procures success to the weak and esteem to all if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours success is dependent upon the glands  sweat glands if there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other persons point of view and see things from that persons angle as well as from your own four things for success work and pray think and believe a graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that individuality is the key to success success is doing ordinary things extraordinarily well you do not pay the price of success you enjoy the price of success every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win  essential to success you are a product of your environment so choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective analyze your life in terms of its environment are the things around you helping you toward success  or are they holding you back success is not to be pursued it is to be attracted by the person you become never continue in a job you dont enjoy if youre happy in what youre doing youll like yourself youll have inner peace and if you have that along with physical health you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined success is the maximum utilization of the ability that you have success is never final failure is never fatal its courage that counts how many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort a little more patience would have achieved success that man is a success who has lived well laughed often and loved much the most glorious moments in your life are not the socalled days of success but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life and the promise of future accomplishments the test of success is not what you do when you are on top success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom the line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it old age is like everything else to make a success of it youve got to start young before everything else getting ready is the secret of success every success story has a parent who says over my dead body every success story has an old person who walks up to you and says when youre acting the fool you know i worry about you sometimes he has achieved success who has worked well laughed often and loved much what material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter and that is being able to make a difference not only in your own life but in other peoples lives microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years one was to copy the mac and the other was to copy lotus success in the spreadsheet  basically the applications business and over the course of the last 10 years microsoft accomplished both of those goals and now they are completely lost we learned about honesty and integrity  that the truth matters that you dont take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules and success doesnt count unless you earn it fair and square for unflagging interest and enjoyment a household of children if things go reasonably well certainly all other forms of success and achievement lose their importance by comparison our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan in which we must fervently believe and upon which we must vigorously act there is no other route to success the path to success is to take massive determined action america is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen but i am afraid it is not going to be a success tell me why is the media here so negative why are we in india so embarrassed to recognise our own strengths our achievements we are such a great nation we have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them why success is often achieved by those who dont know that failure is inevitable my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an african name barack or blessed believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success focused hard work is the real key to success keep your eyes on the goal and just keep taking the next step towards completing it if you arent sure which way to do something do it both ways and see which works better shes the kind of girl who climbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong success demands singleness of purpose whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things no man ever achieved worthwhile success who did not at one time or other find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure personality is the most important thing to an actresss success success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence the extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning the key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear there is no force like success and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it as of the individual so should it be of the nation success is getting what you want happiness is liking what you get success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best theres no abiding success without commitment success is peace of mind which is a direct result of selfsatisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable if you wish to be a success in the world promise everything deliver nothing there is probably a perverse pride in my administration that we were going to do the right thing even if shortterm it was unpopular and i think anybody whos occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you cant be neglecting of marketing and pr and public opinion i do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance it overcomes almost everything even nature one man cannot practice many arts with success you know you are on the road to success if you would do your job and not be paid for it an artist cannot fail it is a success to be one my success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense i stand ready to lead us down a different path where were lifted up by our desire to succeed not dragged down by a resentment of success you grow up a bit damaged or broken then you have some success but you dont know how to feel good about the work youre doing or the life youre leading the ladder of success is never crowded at the top if you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons if you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow halfhearted success that breeds bitterness all around anything that wont sell i dont want to invent its sale is proof of utility and utility is success you might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself a rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success i do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success such emotions make a man forget food sleep friends love everything the battle of life is in most cases fought uphill and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honor if there were no difficulties there would be no success if there were nothing to struggle for there would be nothing to be achieved the central conservative truth is that it is culture not politics that determines the success of a society the central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall forward as occasion offers never look round to see whether any shall note it be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter and think that even such a result is no trifle were constantly striving for success fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about you never achieve success unless you like what you are doing men of age object too much consult too long adventure too little repent too soon and seldom drive business home to the full period but content themselves with a mediocrity of success a constant struggle a ceaseless battle to bring success from inhospitable surroundings is the price of all great achievements ask yourself the secret of your success listen to your answer and practice it the key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life  mental emotional spiritual as well as physical obstacles are necessary for success because in selling as in all careers of importance victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats you do the work and you want people to see it but um while im doing the work the result doesnt matter at all to me ultimately i dont i dont care whether the film is  you know  some big giant boxoffice bonanza and i dont care if its a complete flop to me when a film gets made and its actually finished its a success theyre all a success in their own way if a man loves the labour of his trade apart from any question of success or fame the gods have called him there is little success where there is little laughter it is not the going out of port but the coming in that determines the success of a voyage if we become one of those societies that attack success why not come as certain there will be a lot less success and thats not who we are that business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great american success story success is not greedy as people think but insignificant that is why it satisfies nobody i must admit that i personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to her or his fellow human beings the ability to convert ideas to things is the secret of outward success in all our deeds the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure achievement is not always success while reputed failure often is it is honest endeavor persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances success is dangerous one begins to copy oneself and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others it leads to sterility success is full of promise till one gets it and then it seems like a nest from which the bird has flown perseverance is a great element of success if you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody everyone who achieves success in a great venture solves each problem as they came to it they helped themselves and they were helped through powers known and unknown to them at the time they set out on their voyage they keep going regardless of the obstacles they met in innercity lowincome communities of color theres such a high correlation in terms of educational quality and success i think you can have 10000 explanations for failure but no good explanation for success well i think any author or musician is anxious to have legitimate sales of their products partly so theyre rewarded for their success partly so they can go on and do new things one important key to success is selfconfidence an important key to selfconfidence is preparation our success educationally industrially and politically is based upon the protection of a nation founded by ourselves and the nation can be nowhere else but in africa i owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice and then going away and doing the exact opposite one might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work but i continue to find my greatest pleasure and so my reward in the work that precedes what the world calls success i find my greatest pleasure and so my reward in the work that precedes what the world calls success success is achieved and maintained by those who try and keep trying we learned about gratitude and humility  that so many people had a hand in our success from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean and we were taught to value everyones contribution and treat everyone with respect procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy perseverance  a lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success success in life is founded upon attention to the small things rather than to the large things to the every day things nearest to us rather than to the things that are remote and uncommon our limitations and success will be based most often on your own expectations for ourselves what the mind dwells upon the body acts upon if a man has been his mothers undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling the confidence in success which not seldom brings actual success along with it in the united states i am a great success but i am not a celebrity a great social success is a pretty girl who plays her cards as carefully as if she were plain im an addict im addicted to success thankfully theres no rehab for success seventy percent of success in life is showing up i attribute my success to this  i never gave or took any excuse through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure at the end of the day the most overwhelming key to a childs success is the positive involvement of parents success consecrates the most offensive crimes communication  the human connection  is the key to personal and career success sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them failure is the highway to success ambition is the path to success persistence is the vehicle you arrive in to many a man and sometimes to a youth there comes the opportunity to choose between honorable competence and tainted wealth the young man who starts out to be poor and honorable holds in his hand one of the strongest elements of success success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world except money have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life will become a beautiful success forget about the consequences of failure failure is only a temporary change in direction to set you straight for your next success personal satisfaction is the most important ingredient of success the winners edge is not in a gifted birth a high iq or in talent the winners edge is all in the attitude not aptitude attitude is the criterion for success a strong positive selfimage is the best possible preparation for success time is the most precious element of human existence the successful person knows how to put energy into time and how to draw success from time the greatest thing a man can do in this world is to make the most possible out of the stuff that has been given him this is success and there is no other success is a great deodorant the secret of success is constancy to purpose learning and innovation go hand in hand the arrogance of success is to think that what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow the great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up almost no one is foolish enough to imagine that he automatically deserves great success in any field of activity yet almost everyone believes that he automatically deserves success in marriage no one has a corner on success it is his who pays the price the secret of success is to be ready when your opportunity comes a great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up if i die prematurely i shall be saved from being bored to death at my own success success without honor is an unseasoned dish it will satisfy your hunger but it wont taste good all that is necessary to break the spell of inertia and frustration is this act as if it were impossible to fail that is the talisman the formula the command of right about face which turns us from failure to success success is the child of audacity success didnt spoil me ive always been insufferable success isnt measured by money or power or social rank success is measured by your discipline and inner peace not every difficult and dangerous thing is suitable for training but only that which is conducive to success in achieving the object of our effort youth is not enough and love is not enough and success is not enough and if we could achieve it enough would not be enough i just go where my heart tells me where my gut tells me to go where im enjoying my life the most where i feel like i can have the most success ive truly enjoyed my experience in nascar to the point that i want to do it full time every failure is a step to success the more tranquil a man becomes the greater is his success his influence his power for good calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom success in life comes not from holding a good hand but in playing a poor hand well id rather be a failure at something i love than a success at something i hate no man can be a failure if he thinks hes a success if he thinks he is a winner then he is you will be a failure until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success this is done by making an affirmation which clicks i remember one day sitting at the pool and suddenly the tears were streaming down my cheeks why was i so unhappy i had success i had security but it wasnt enough i was exploding inside the secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes king louis philippe once said to me that he attributed the great success of the british nation in political life to their talking politics after dinner if we get our selfesteem from superficial places from our popularity appearance business success financial situation health any of these we will be disappointed because no one can guarantee that well have them tomorrow failure is not our only punishment for laziness there is also the success of others life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties passing from one step of success to another forming new wishes and seeing them gratified the best augury of a mans success in his profession is that he thinks it the finest in the world success is not built on success its built on failure its built on frustration sometimes its built on catastrophe each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem the success i have achieved in bodybuilding motion pictures and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the american people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams if i had permitted my failures or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success to discourage me i cannot see any way in which i would ever have made progress success can make you go one of two ways it can make you a prima donna  or it can smooth the edges take away the insecurities let the nice things come out success comes when people act together failure tends to happen alone i have no problem with the people who work hard to get success but i think people are very jealous about success i work very hard and they dont appreciate that humor has bailed me out of more tight situations than i can think of if you go with your instincts and keep your humor creativity follows with luck success comes too the idea of capitalism is not just success but also the failure that allows success to happen everything i have my career my success my family i owe to america creative risk taking is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high thoughtless risks are destructive of course but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity in order that people may be happy in their work these three things are needed they must be fit for it they must not do too much of it and they must have a sense of success in it an excuse becomes an obstacle in your journey to success when it is made in place of your best effort or when it is used as the object of the blame they talk about the failure of socialism but where is the success of capitalism in africa asia and latin america the talent of success is nothing more than doing what you can do well and doing well whatever you do without thought of fame if it comes at all it will come because it is deserved not because it is sought after the envious man grows lean at the success of his neighbor no one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others the wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude within the hearts men loyalty and consideration are esteemed greater than success i feel like i want to take care of everyone and i also feel this terrible guilt if i am unable to and i have felt this way ever since all this success started what i have in common with the character in truman is this incredible need to please people i feel like i want to take care of everyone and i also feel this terrible guilt if i am unable to and i have felt this way ever since all this success started we can come to look upon the deaths of our enemies with as much regret as we feel for those of our friends namely when we miss their existence as witnesses to our success no foreign policy  no matter how ingenious  has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none the secret to success is good leadership and good leadership is all about making the lives of your team members or workers better the lord gave us two ends  one to sit on and the other to think with success depends on which one we use the most whether you come from a council estate or a country estate your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude the season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success it is only the cynicism that is born of success that is penetrating and valid always remember that striving and struggle precede success even in the dictionary no one succeeds without effort those who succeed owe their success to perseverance the road to success is always under construction raising children is an uncertain thing success is reached only after a life of battle and worry if you work just for money youll never make it but if you love what youre doing and you always put the customer first success will be yours along with success comes a reputation for wisdom its very easy for me to say what success is i think success is connecting with an audience who understands you and having a dialogue with them i think success is continuing to push yourself forward creatively and not sort of becoming a caricature of yourself i can honestly say that i was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking if i felt it was the right thing to do i was for it regardless of the possible outcome when you see something that is technically sweet you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success that is the way it was with the atomic bomb hope is a state of mind not of the world hope in this deep and powerful sense is not the same as joy that things are going well or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success but rather an ability to work for something because it is good honesty is the cornerstone of all success without which confidence and ability to perform shall cease to exist success or failure in business is caused more by the mental attitude even than by mental capacities success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal theres no secret about success did you ever know a successful man who didnt tell you about it there is no success without hardship willpower is the key to success successful people strive no matter what they feel by applying their will to overcome apathy doubt or fear im not after fame and success and fortune and power its mostly that i want to have a good job and have good friends thats the good stuff in life success follows doing what you want to do there is no other way to be successful it is wise to keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final after my spectacular failures i could not be satisfied with an ordinary success a desire to be in charge of our own lives a need for control is born in each of us it is essential to our mental health and our success that we take control ive been so fortunate in my life that my family has never been jealous of my success they have shown true love and commitment to me by being supportive they shared in it in hollywood a marriage is a success if it outlasts milk whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained progress stops i am doomed to an eternity of compulsive work no set goal achieved satisfies success only breeds a new goal the golden apple devoured has seeds it is endless mohammed was not an apparent failure he was a dazzling success politically as well as spiritually and islam went from strength to strength to strength no experience is a cause of success or failure we do not suffer from the shock of our experiences socalled trauma  but we make out of them just what suits our purposes the freedom to fail is vital if youre going to succeed most successful people fail from time to time and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success success in any endeavor depends on the degree to which it is an expression of your true self to have long term success as a coach or in any position of leadership you have to be obsessed in some way be yourself follow your instincts success depends at least in part on the ability to carry it off failure is only postponed success as long as courage coaches ambition the habit of persistence is the habit of victory the compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter in the best sense one stays young however things may seem no evil thing is success and no good thing is failure ive learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success success is not in what you have but who you are education is the key to success in life and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students desire is the key to motivation but its the determination and commitment to unrelenting pursuit of your goal  a commitment to excellence  that will enable you to attain the success you seek i did standup comedy for 18 years ten of those years were spent learning four years were spent refining and four years were spent in wild success i was seeking comic originality and fame fell on me as a byproduct the course was more plodding than heroic we learn wisdom from failure much more than from success we often discover what will do by finding out what will not do and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery when it comes to success there are no shortcuts the decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success it is not intelligent it is not beautiful it is not just it is not virtuous and it doesnt deliver the goods for true success ask yourself these four questions why why not why not me why not now no student ever attains very eminent success by simply doing what is required of him it is the amount and excellence of what is over and above the required that determines the greatness of ultimate distinction when i prayed for success i forgot to ask for sound sleep and good digestion the world judge of men by their ability in their profession and we judge of ourselves by the same test for it is on that on which our success in life depends success seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistakes but they dont quit success is a beast and it actually puts the emphasis on the wrong thing you get away with more instead of looking within while i was doing standup i thought i knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me so i became whoever i thought people wanted me to be id say yes when i wanted to say no and i even wore a few dresses whether a party can have much success without a woman present i must ask others to decide but one thing is certain no party is any fun unless seasoned with folly keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final when i finish a picture i dont show it to anyone if i feel its not good enough yet ive learnt to listen to my partners and my friends for me its the biggest success if they like it the secret of my success is a two word answer know people im hopeful i know there is a lot of ambition in washington obviously but i hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure the concept of the good ol days must be one of our societys biggest delusions top reasons for depression as well as most often used excuse for lack of success a government for the people must depend for its success on the intelligence the morality the justice and the interest of the people themselves enjoy your sweat because hard work doesnt guarantee success but without it you dont have a chance never mind what others do do better than yourself beat your own record from day to day and you are a success success is where preparation and opportunity meet for success attitude is equally as important as ability if success is a habit it is a hard one to acquire enjoying success requires the ability to adapt only by being open to change will you have a true opportunity to get the most from your talent we must believe in luck for how else can we explain the success of those we dont like the more defects a man may have the older he is the less lovable the more resounding his success the only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves on the other an artist must never be a prisoner prisoner an artist should never be a prisoner of himself prisoner of style prisoner of reputation prisoner of success etc my success and my misfortunes the bright and the dark days i have gone through everything has proved to me that in this world either physical or moral good comes out of evil just as well as evil comes out of good the ladder of success in hollywood is usually a press agent actor director producer leading man and you are a star if you sleep with each of them in that order crude but true success in training the boy depends largely on the scoutmasters own personal example thats the definition of success for the modern democrat party as many people dependent on government as possible is the objective remember you will not always win some days the most resourceful individual will taste defeat but there is in this case always tomorrow  after you have done your best to achieve success today failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor success is only meaningful and enjoyable if it feels like your own men judge us by the success of our efforts god looks at the efforts themselves the power of fortune is confessed only by the miserable for the happy impute all their success to prudence or merit i have always been pushed by the negative the apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night before the reviews are out i am more compelled to get back to work than if i had a success we are taught to consume and thats what we do but if we realized that there really is no reason to consume that its just a mind set that its just an addiction then we wouldnt be out there stepping on peoples hands climbing the corporate ladder of success but while success and failure depend on conditions the mind neither waxes nor wanes no one can possibly achieve any real and lasting success or get rich in business by being a conformist think of success as a game of chance in which you have control over the odds as you begin to master concepts in personal achievement you are increasing your odds of achieving success success is about enjoying what you have and where you are while pursuing achievable goals from success you get a lot of things but not that great inside thing that love brings you i want anyone who believes in life liberty pursuit of happiness to succeed and i want any force any person any element of an overarching big government that would stop your success i want that organization that element or that person to fail i want you to succeed dont think of it as failure think of it as timereleased success i hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life i dont think about my previous success im happy that the work ive done has been very successful success is a journey not a destination the doing is often more important than the outcome nobody travels on the road to success without a puncture or two the first requisite for success is the ability to apply your physical and mental energies to one problem incessantly without growing weary constant success shows us but one side of the world adversity brings out the reverse of the picture success and failure are equally disastrous luxury is the wolf at the door and its fangs are the vanities and conceits germinated by success when an artist learns this he knows where the danger is success isnt permanent and failure isnt fatal whether in success or in failure im proud of every single movie ive ever directed ambition is the path to success persistence is the vehicle you arrive in anyone who wants to sell you overnight success or wealth is not interested in your success they are interested in your money everything you need for better future and success has already been written and guess what all you have to do is go to the library the two most important requirements for major success are first being in the right place at the right time and second doing something about it singleness of purpose is one of the chief essentials for success in life no matter what may be ones aim success  keeping your mind awake and your desire asleep think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success a whole clear glorious life lies before you achieve achieve our purpose in vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression it is not conquest it is not empire it is not foreign bases it is not domination it is simply put just to prevent the forceful conquest of south vietnam by north vietnam talent alone wont make you a success neither will being in the right place at the right time unless you are ready the most important question is are your ready like so many american families our families werent asking for much they didnt begrudge anyone elses success or care that others had much more than they did in fact they admired it success is the sum of small efforts  repeated day in and day out most success springs from an obstacle or failure i became a cartoonist largely because i failed in my goal of becoming a successful executive success is getting and achieving what you want happiness is wanting and being content with what you get on receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided on my illustrious predecessor and which he has discharged so faithfully and so well i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success for an actress to be a success she must have the face of venus the brains of a minerva the grace of terpsichore the memory of a macaulay the figure of juno and the hide of a rhinoceros the level of our success is limited only by our imagination and no act of kindness however small is ever wasted i dont know what keeps me going sometimes i wonder i think its just pure perseverance and wanting to succeed and having that burning desire to always have success success should always be just beyond your grasp in the united states theres a puritan ethic and a mythology of success he who is successful is good in latin countries in catholic countries a successful person is a sinner success took me to her bosom like a maternal boa constrictor temporary success can be achieved in spite of lack of other fundamental qualities but no advancements can be maintained without hard work honesty is the most single most important factor having a direct bearing on the final success of an individual corporation or product when success comes people can try to trick you or take advantage of you no man is a success in business unless he loves his work i was motivated by just thinking that if you had all this external success that everyone would love you and everything would be peaceful and wonderful its not just the grammys that ive pulled out of i also pulled out of the english awards as well the reason that i wanted to pull out was because i believe very much that the music industry as a whole is mainly concerned with material success it is on our failures that we base a new and different and better success success is a consequence and must not be a goal personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement all success all achievement in real life grows an actors popularity is fleeting his success has the life expectancy of a small boy who is about to look into a gas tank with a lighted match give me a couple of years and ill make that actress an overnight success ill tell you there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer i believe that success can happen at any time and at any age youve achieved success in your field when you dont know whether what youre doing is work or play success is survival the appreciative smile the chuckle the soundless mirth so important to the success of comedy cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it your success depends mainly upon what you think of yourself and whether you believe in yourself the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success after a lifetime of working raising families and contributing to the success of this nation in countless other ways senior citizens deserve to retire with dignity there is much to be said for failure it is much more interesting than success to get down to the quick of it respect motivates me  not success success is sweet and sweeter if long delayed and gotten through many struggles and defeats i believe in luck how else can you explain the success of those you dislike the will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success the most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion failure is simply the nonpresence of success but a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions let us realize that the privilege to work is a gift the power to work is a blessing the love of work is success ive stopped apologizing to myself for having this great period of success and financial acceptance people fall forward to success within the us the obama presidency will be mainly measured by the success or failure of his economic policies and here i fear the monstrous stimulus package with which this administration stumbled out of the gate will prove to be obamas waterloo i define success as being comfortable with yourself and your life and that is about as good as it gets really the person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy inevitable part of the process of getting to the top think little goals and expect little achievements think big goals and win big success why be a man when you can be a success i have no time for those who say there is no way scotland could go it alone i know firsthand the contribution scotland and scots make to britains success  so for me theres no question about whether scotland could be an independent nation hopefully ill continue to have the success ive had the thing you dont dream about as a kid is all the peripheral stuff that comes with success the reward of art is not fame or success but intoxication that is why so many bad artists are unable to give it up providence has nothing good or high in store for one who does not resolutely aim at something high or good a purpose is the eternal condition of success we are a people that have always celebrated other peoples success so long as we always had the opportunity to meet that success ourselves that is the american nature that is the american character that is one of the things that makes us different from the rest of the world and im afraid we could lose that or are on the verge of losing that if you want to be truly successful invest in yourself to get the knowledge you need to find your unique factor when you find it and focus on it and persevere your success will blossom i hate to be a failure i hate and regret the failure of my marriages i would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success the prospect of success in achieving our most cherished dream is not without its terrors who is more deprived and alone than the man who has achieved his dream if god has made the world a perfect mechanism he has at least conceded so much to our imperfect intellect that in order to predict little parts of it we need not solve innumerable differential equations but can use dice with fair success im an eternal realist and the success rate for being an actor is pretty low success has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself its what you do for others for someone whos had the level of success ive had theres been very little critical review of my work which is pretty fascinating rock and roll is still asking people like me to live up to the old guards concept of what success is but it doesnt mean anything there could be no honor in a sure success but much might be wrested from a sure defeat it was so draining going to parties to rub elbows with soandso and act like its no big deal when really all i was doing was hoping id have the success they had im either going to go completely mental completely bankrupt or have the best success of my life one fails forward toward success were not uncomfortable with it and weve already been through enough of the music business where im not really worried that commercial success is going to in some way  were already past saving you know what i mean its too late for us success represents the 1 of your work which results from the 99 that is called failure the worst part of success is to try finding someone who is happy for you the making of friends who are real friends is the best token we have of a mans success in life some of the best lessons we ever learn are learned from past mistakes the error of the past is the wisdom and success of the future permanent success cannot be achieved except by incessant intellectual labour always inspired by the ideal i worked half my life to be an overnight success and still it took me by surprise the danger of success is that it makes us forget the worlds dreadful injustice for a good 10 to 12 years i was working nonstop and i wasnt really enjoying my success i think all those people i did stories about measured their own success by the joy their work was giving them the media says that equality for women has arrived but if you look around you still dont see girls playing guitars and having success with it the keys to brand success are selfdefinition transparency authenticity and accountability refuse to accept the belief that your professional relevance career success or financial security turns on the next update on the latest technology sometimes its good to put the paddle down and just let the canoe glide the secret of success is to be in harmony with existence to be always calm to let each wave of life wash us a little farther up the shore indeed i regard the enduring support which i have received over the years from all sections of the community in ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which i may have achieved as an actor no one is guaranteed happiness you can pursue it but if you happen to find success along the way on that road to happiness conservatives believe you should not be demonized or penalized for it success is never final but failure can be i am highly offended by the total lack of acknowledgement of my contribution to laker success if not for the success that medicine has made i might be part of a much different story right now democrats believe in reigniting the american dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all so everyone can succeed people are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal success is achieved by developing our strengths not by eliminating our weaknesses i cannot give you the formula for success but i can give you the formula for failure  which is try to please everybody hope is the companion of power and the mother of success for who so hopes has within him the gift of miracles when a small child i thought that success spelled happiness i was wrong happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment but soon flits away success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism failure is a part of success sometimes people take it for granted that they had success especially nowadays when you have instant stardom a lot of people feel entitlement and nobody is entitled to anything americas wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success take away their incentive with badmouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy you have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become uninterested in money compliments or publicity its ironic that at age 32 at probably the greatest moment of my career with the godfather having such an enormous success i wasnt even aware of it because i was somewhere else under the deadline again success is usually the culmination of controlling failure success is just being happy and i try so many different things i do a lot of different things because i think god has helped me to love myself i know who god is and i love god success is always something completely different to people i feel like ive succeeded if im doing something that makes me happy and im not lying to anybody the road to success is always under construction success for me its to raise happy healthy human beings my success was due to good luck hard work and support and advice from friends and mentors but most importantly it depended on me to keep trying after i had failed a minutes success pays the failure of years i believe there are three keys to success for me it is keeping my priorities in order its my faith and my family and then the business without an openminded mind you can never be a great success the five essential entrepreneurial skills for success are concentration discrimination organization innovation and communication youve got to eat while you dream youve got to deliver on shortrange commitments while you develop a longrange strategy and vision and implement it the success of doing both walking and chewing gum if you will getting it done in the shortrange and delivering a longrange plan and executing on that theres no right or wrong success or failure i always say be humble but be firm humility and openness are the key to success without compromising your beliefs i think people often confuse success with fame and stardom well certainly one of the ironies of the success of affirmative action is that the middle class within the black community no longer lives within black community by and large the historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination by itself would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction we also need intervention to promulgate a middleclass ethic of success among the poor while expanding opportunities for economic betterment i sort of understood that when i first started that you shouldnt repeat a success very often youre going to and maybe the first time you do it works and you love it but then youre trapped the very first step towards success in any occupation is to become interested in it about the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure positive thinking is the key to success in business education pro football anything that you can mention i go out there thinking that im going to complete every pass you really have to work hard and apply yourself and by applying yourself and working hard and being diligent you can achieve success success breeds complacency complacency breeds failure only the paranoid survive success is like a liberation or the first phrase of a love story so many stars lose their way and with success become more neurotic not less so it is a mistake to suppose that men succeed through success they much oftener succeed through failures precept study advice and example could never have taught them so well as failure has done success breeds success i always think im the tom cruise of music  a lot of success and fans but no critics darling like the british constitution she owes her success in practice to her inconsistencies in principle well success does not mean doing well remember i come from such an excessively overdone redcarpet place called hollywood so im used to people blowing up their success in ways that are far above and beyond the truth although in skating you compete with other people anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves and for me the idea that i could always do better learn more learn faster is something that came from skating but i carried that with me for the rest of my life success and failure are both part of life both are not permanent success cant be forced id rather have huge success and huge failures than travel in the middle of the road fathers and mothers have lost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children is for them to be wise specialized competence and success are all that they can imagine many individuals are doing what they can but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable success cannot come from standstill men methods change and men must change with them i wanted to highlight that whole dreadful process in book publishing that nothing succeeds like success the secret of our success is that we never never give up i think the success of democracy is not really police security its the presence of a broad middle class the stronger the middle class of a people is the less you have to worry about one group coming in and exploiting the democratic process for its own ends i wish i could just go tell all the young women i work with all these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success i wish i could tell that to my daughter but its not that simple its so interesting how success hits people and how they react to it i get hired by companies to hack into their systems and break into their physical facilities to find security holes our success rate is 100 weve always found a hole youve got to work hard for your success and youve got to have a steady presence thats the secret success always necessitates a degree of ruthlessness given the choice of friendship or success id probably choose success one of the rewards of success is freedom the ability to do whatever you like i want to swim in both directions at once desire success court failure breast cancer deaths in america have been declining for more than a decade much of that success is due to early detection and better treatments for women i strongly encourage women to get a mammogram i have a tendency to sabotage relationships i have a tendency to sabotage everything fear of success fear of failure fear of being afraid useless goodfornothing thoughts young man the secret of my success is that an early age i discovered that i was not god the framers of the constitution were so clear in the federalist papers and elsewhere that they felt an independent judiciary was critical to the success of the nation the great dream merchant disney was a success because makebelieve was what everyone seemed to need in a spiritually empty land well i think that theres a very thin dividing line between success and failure and i think if you start a business without financial backing youre likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line rockefeller once explained the secret of success get up early work late  and strike oil i dont dwell on success maybe thats one reason im successful success consists of getting up just one more time than you fall we need to accept that we wont always make the right decisions that well screw up royally sometimes  understanding that failure is not the opposite of success its part of success every soldier must know before he goes into battle how the little battle he is to fight fits into the larger picture and how the success of his fighting will influence the battle as a whole you know i start with the assumption that or with with the belief that this president has to succeed we all have an enormous amount of capital invested in his success his success is the countrys success i think the idea that you know who your inner self is on a daily basis because you know whats good for you 25 years ago may not be good for you now so to keep in touch with that i think thats the first ingredient for success because if youre a successful human being everything else is gravy i think without failure there is no sweetness in success theres no understanding of it in most things success depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed islam is a religion of success unlike christianity which has as its main image in the west at least a man dying in a devastating disgraceful helpless death we moved into the back made it into a little 50s sitting room and started to sell the records we had an immediate success for one thing these teddy boys were thrilled to buy the records i dont think success is harmful as so many people say rather i believe it indispensable to talent if for nothing else than to increase the talent obama is capable  as evidenced by his firstterm success with health care reform but mandatebuilding requires humility a trait not easily associated with him i always think when theres stuff that people dont like i always say that if i have another success ill enjoy it more but you dont really i think that the reason for my success is that i am really not aspirational i am inspirational in that the people at home feel like they can really relate to me american inventiveness and the desire to build developed because we were guaranteed the right to own our success nothing succeeds like the appearance of success it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him success isnt everything but it makes a man stand straight theres more to life than success and if you can try to be more wellrounded youll be able to enjoy your success more it wont own you or control you in new york everyones desperate for success desperate for money and desperate to be accepted but in london theyre more laid back about things like that success is always something completely different to people i feel like ive succeeded if im doing something that makes me happy and im not lying to anybody im not doing that now so i feel really good about myself this weird thing happens when youre in a movie that has some level of success people start offering you all kinds of things and they just expect you to do them because theyll be good for your career its not about the projects integrity or anything like that one measure of your success will be the degree to which you build up others who work with you while building up others you will build up yourself money does not guarantee success all those who are around me are the bridge to my success so they are all important for an actress to be a success she must have the face of a venus the brains of a minerva the grace of terpsichore the memory of a macaulay the figure of juno and the hide of a rhinoceros the art of effective listening is essential to clear communication and clear communication is necessary to management success the most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success the best revenge in the world is success an entrepreneur assumes the risk and is dedicated and committed to the success of whatever he or she undertakes entrepreneurs are risk takers willing to roll the dice with their money or reputation on the line in support of an idea or enterprise they willingly assume responsibility for the success or failure of a venture and are answerable for all its facets do business managers have a commitment to anything more than the success of their company and to making money it would be hard to say that they do indeed many business leaders deny that there is any conflict between selfinterest and the interests of all eventually with success i started to feel more and more isolated  like i didnt have a community of artists when you grow up in the music industry trying to be britney spears because thats what sells records and then you realize all i have to do is be myself i should have thought of that a long time ago it feels good to have success come from whats actually inside of you im sure not afraid of success and ive learned not to be afraid of failure the only thing im afraid of now is of being someone i dont like much i was very clear that i wanted to keep thor out of the rest of the marvel universe for no less than the first six issues and the success of the book i think speaks well to that decision liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family i planned my success i knew it was going to happen ive learned that success comes in a very prickly package whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you success and the art of making music are two different things for me with everything that is complex we learn if you dont learn then its an utter and abject failure if you do learn and youre able to apply that to the next situation then you take away a measure of success education is a fundamental principle of what made america a success we cant afford to throw any young people away i am not fighting for success just to get more beauty out of myself and share it with more people people think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face but its easy to be chewed up and spat out youve got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it to do a common thing uncommonly well brings success the only question to ask yourself is how much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve this success your chances of success in any undertaking can always be measured by your belief in yourself so much of a professional athletes success depends upon not necessarily the play itself but how he deals with always saying how you deal with good is just as important as how you deal with bad the secret of success is sincerity but no nation can base its survival and development on luck and prayers alone while its leadership fritters away every available opportunity for success and concrete achievement and in reality i dont think its a real documentary its more a story of her life its a story of survival its a story of the time in which she lived the story of success and failure success is following the pattern of life one enjoys most for marriage to be a success every woman and every man should have her and his own bathroom the end ive had great success being a total idiot the film is not a success until it makes money its only good when theres a dollar figure attached to the box office no one ever attains success by simply doing what is required of him they thought i was a success as soon as i started paying the bills the hardest thing to find in life is balance  especially the more success you have the more you look to the other side of the gate what do i need to stay grounded in touch in love connected emotionally balanced look within yourself my father was an immigrant who literally walked across europe to get out of russia he fought in world war i he was wounded in action my father was a great success even though he never had money he was a very determined man a great role model we create success or failure on the course primarily by our thoughts i feel lucky because i was a nerd which i talk about in the book but i had academic success so through that because thats what my parents put a great deal of value on i had a great childhood because i sort of fulfilled the expectations of being good at school my success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day the road to success is filled with women pushing their husbands along sometimes success will get in the way of maturity  at least temporarily anytime you play a team sport the success of the team really makes everything better its nice i had a lot of success from the start i never really was tested for long periods of time i got my first professional job while i was a senior in college i signed with the william morris agency before i graduated which is  you know like check it out im pretty young im only about 40 years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and its exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right i should just put it bluntly because were all sort of friends here now  its exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me oh so jesus what a thought you know thats the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine oclock in the morning and i dont want to go there when somebody has an enormous success in this culture people start asking two questions which are what are you doing now and how are you going to beat that and i have to say i love the assumption that your intention is to beat yourself constantly  that youre in battle against yourself my career started young and i was really ambitious and then i had success and i hung out with people who were much older i think i might have been temporally misplaced so i thought i was 40 it was a premature midlife crisis the only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be i believe success is preparation because opportunity is going to knock on your door sooner or later but are you prepared to answer that youll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure the manic pursuit of success cost me everything i could love my wife my three children some friends i would have liked to grow old with the success of the rat pack or the clan was due to the camaraderie the three guys who work together and kid each other and love each other real success is not on the stage but off the stage as a human being and how you get along with your fellow man everyone has determination  its a question of how you use it hers is based on power and success and conquering she doesnt care what she has to do or who gets hurt in the process in that way were very very different a lot of football success is in the mind you must believe you are the best and then make sure that you are muslims must believe that all power success and victory comes from god alone once you have a lot of success you become a target in many ways without arthurs voice i never would have enjoyed that success a tragic irony of life is that we so often achieve success or financial independence after the chief reason for which we sought it has passed away theres not an instruction manual on how to deal with success so you just have to rely on having great friends and a good team success is measured by your discipline and inner peace the occupy movement needs an organizing principle and  just as the tea party did  it needs some actual measures of success choose one candidate whose agenda is squarely within that of the movement and make his or her electoral success a focal point in the end you make your reputation and you have your success based upon credibility and being able to provide people who are really hungry for information what they want youve got to ask asking is in my opinion the worlds most powerful  and neglected  secret to success and happiness despite the success cult men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of the effort involved in getting there  or failing to get there my college degree was in theater but the real reason if i have any success in that milieu so to speak is because i spent a lot of years directing i spent a lot of years behind the camera real success is being totally indulgent about your own trip you put your blinders on about the garbage and go full speed ahead do something you really like and hopefully it pays the rent as far as im concerned thats success success is more dangerous than failure the ripples break over a wider coastline nearly all monster stories depend for their success on jack killing the giant beowulf or st george slaying the dragon harry potter triumphing over the basilisk that is their inner grammar and the whole shape of the story leads towards it i think you can have moderate success by copying something else but if you really want to knock it out of the park you have to do something different and take chances as you walk in gods divine wisdom you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life i didnt have a whole lot of success getting dates i was always a bit of a geek success is the sweetest revenge you can never be comfortable with your success youve got to be paranoid youre going to lose it success needs no explanation failure does not have one that matters it sounds cliche but success is your friends your family what you do and if youre happy when you wake up success on any major scale requires you to accept responsibility in the final analysis the one quality that all successful people have is the ability to take on responsibility the only thing i can say about having this type of success is that you can get yourself in trouble because basically the world is set open for you people will say yes to anything you ask so its basically down to you and what you want or need your success story is a bigger story than whatever youre trying to say on stage success makes life easier it doesnt make living easier it takes two to make a marriage a success and only one to make it a failure the first principle of success is desire  knowing what you want desire is the planting of your seed dont be afraid of failure be afraid of petty success because after my first year i had a lot of success took everybody by storm came back the next year thought it was easy and didnt have near the season i had the previous year it was kind of a wakeup call and so life goes on married couples who work together to build and maintain a business assume broad responsibilities not only is their work important to our local and national economies but their success is central to the wellbeing of their families hiphop is more about attaining wealth people respect success they respect big they dont even have to like your music if youre big enough people are drawn to you true leadership lies in guiding others to success in ensuring that everyone is performing at their best doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well modesty should be typical of the success of a champion i will not be discouraged by failure i will not be elated by success follow your passion nothing  not wealth success accolades or fame  is worth spending a lifetime doing things you dont enjoy everybody loves success but they hate successful people by far the most important factor in the success or failure of any school far more important than tests or standards or businessmodel methods of accountability is simply attracting the besteducated most exciting young people into urban schools and keeping them there there is never just one thing that leads to success for anyone i feel it always a combination of passion dedication hard work and being in the right place at the right time philanthropy is the thing that i am really excited about and having success means i can do more there is no scientific answer for success you cant define it youve simply got to live it and do it the secret to success is to own nothing but control everything its the quality of the ordinary the straight the square that accounts for the great stability and success of our nation its a quality to be proud of but its a quality that many people seem to have neglected we do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is the x factor luck is great but most of life is hard work we do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work the problem with being british i dont know if its me being british or being raised a strict catholic but you never really enjoy success when humor can be made to alternate with melancholy one has a success but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time its just wonderful success makes you less intimidated by things people still dont appreciate how ephemeral success is i think that the entertainment industry itself has a history of chasing success any time a hit product comes out all the other companies start chasing after that success and trying to recreate it by putting out similar products it would be a joy for me if someone who was working with me became a big success in america as opposed to the old country success was based on merit but i like not these great success of yours for i know how jealous are the gods i think the measure of your success to a certain extent will be the amount of things written about you that arent true success means having the courage the determination and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be i havent deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies in fact its probably been quite the opposite after the success of the mask i wasnt offered all that many blonde bombshell parts to be honest i think people believed from the beginning that i could actually walk and talk at the same time yes i have made a lot of money and i have a lot of respect my films have done well and i know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me i really just thought this is like a strange dream i have never thought this is a success  i dont have a standard all of us are born for a reason but all of us dont discover why success in life has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself its what you do for others my own early experiences in war led me to suspect the value of discipline even in that sphere where it is so often regarded as the first essential for success when people stand up and talk about the great success that the eu has been im not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore i didnt have any success in show business until i was 30 to 31 years of age the nfl has been an amazing page in this chapter of my life i pray that all successive adventures offer me the same potential for growth success and most importantly fun as my father used to tell me the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy am i coasting on some early success yeah it was a good lucky break for me but i would rather earn my way back again than simply conform to what people are expecting one goes through school college medical school and ones internship learning little or nothing about goodness but a good deal about success the secrets of success are a good wife and a steady job my wife told me hollywood a city i was to come back to time and again in sickness and in health in success and in failure with anticipation and with dread but i think its more normal for my team to have no success than it is to win two consecutive european cups im not a defender of old or new football managers i believe in good ones and bad ones those that achieve success and those that dont i suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate ive had a lot of success ive had failures so i learn from the failure lesson from patakis success is use the political moment i realise that i do not change the course of history i am an actor i do a movie thats the end of it you have to realise we are just clowns for hire after i had success it was great at first not to worry about money it was on my mind when i was growing up i rejected the notion that my race or sex would bar my success in life success depends almost entirely on how effectively you learn to manage the games two ultimate adversaries the course and yourself im glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable they saw me hit this great success it was a blast and we had a lot of laughs and it was just an amazing time they passed away and then after i got you know famous all these haters came out of nowhere the one thing that makes me feel super lucky about my financial success is that i have a housekeeper if i wasnt even famous or had any success i would still wake up and put tons of makeup on and put on a cool outfit thats always been who ive been my whole life so thats never gonna change i love fashion i love getting dressed up i love halloween too success consists in being successful not in having potential for success any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace but theres no palace till its built the quick success was a bit strange to get used to in a way a certain amount of selfcriticism is a good thing because it keeps you humble realizing that no matter what success youve achieved you can still make enemies makes you humble too success is the necessary misfortune of life but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early success is not in never failing but rising everytime you fall i dont think about financial success as the measurement of my success excess is success sometimes because of my success i am afraid that i was not a good father with the first two i was too strong and with the other three i was too weak i feel like a hostage to fortune not that i am complaining i wanted to play the role but in truth i didnt think the show would be such a success ok i thought it would fail not because it was bad i was confident it was good but plenty of good things just sort of wither on the vine i admit i cant shake the idea that there is virtue in suffering that there is a sort of psychic economy whereby if you embrace success happiness and comfort these things have to be paid for its absolutely essential that we have the same safeguards that straight couples do but i want more than a 50 percent chance of success i dont want to emulate that i have more love success and security than i could ever dream of i see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire in fact i consider it integral to our success mechanism becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble if you must have it in order to be happy then you are denying the happiness of the here and now success is always temporary when all is said and one the only thing youll have left is your character when i meet successful people i ask 100 questions as to what they attribute their success to it is usually the same persistence hard work and hiring good people with believe bringing really big success for me outside of the uk for the first time it meant i have been touring around the world and that led to a gap from the studio i really feel like the gap has done me the world of good throughout that time i was able to collect songs that i really loved i have found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict adherence to the view that for you to gain those you deal with should gain as well like everybody i have invested in things that have gone bad because theres never any guarantee of success or profit when it comes to money when everything happens to you when youre so young youre very lucky but by the same token youre never going to have that same feeling again the first time anything happens to you  your first love your first success  the second one is never the same we all know that social security is one of this countrys greatest success stories in the 20th century enjoy failure and learn from it you can never learn from success in the digital age of overnight success stories such as facebook the hard slog is easily overlooked i went to america and got into a band had success had hits in australia yeah ideally id probably wish to be more anonymous but scrutiny and success go together and i want to be successful well i do feel that i carry the responsibility of representing my country wherever i am and this responsibility came with the success that i had in last couple of years not just myself but the whole group of tennis players that comes from serbia and athletes in general are in this moment the biggest ambassadors that our country has theres a lot of blood sweat and guts between dreams and success im not sure anybodys ready to see me in a drama and loving movies so much ive seen a lot of comics try to make that transition too fast and it can be detrimental and i dont think ive had as much success as i need in the comedy genre to open up those opportunities being best is a false goal you have to measure success on your own terms i want to make sure i dont interfere with the success of that team next year i dont see any way i could go to practice like most of em do and not hurt the team id go nuts if i tried doing that the success of any great moral enterprise does not depend upon numbers team gbs success at the beijing olympics can in part be said to have been made in manchester for example all the cycling medal winners trained at manchesters velodrome the national cycling centre for us political activists and candidates the morning after any election is a mix of emotions  the personal and the immediate the culmination of your own recent campaigning efforts and the fortunes of your party and the success or otherwise of what you stand for and believe in i never expected any sort of success with mockingbird i sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement ive learned its always better to have a small percentage of a big success than a hundred percent of nothing though i had success in my research both when i was mad and when i was not eventually i felt that my work would be better respected if i thought and acted like a normal person i dont think success arrives and youre suddenly happy its not like that if people think that theyll be very disappointed there is no middle ground in hollywood youre a failure or youre a success that mentality is wild i think the success of a talk show depends on how true it is to the personality of the person hosting it the shows i really admire like oprah and ellen are distinctively like their hosts so i think my show will be successful only if we try to stay consistent to my own sense of myself success will always be measured by the extent to which we serve the buying public anyone who has to fight even with the most modern weapons against an enemy in complete command of the air fights like a savage against modern european troops under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success to me success is choice and opportunity dullness in matters of government is a good sign and not a bad one  in particular dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence an indication of its success the kind of theater that i do is sort of narrative realism which i think in the broadest sense is legitimate to say is mainstream i mean in a certain sense suzanloris plays have had mainstream levels of success but suzanlori is in some ways not a narrative realist i was if you like a successful schoolboy in that i had a degree of talent in all the required things that make you a success at school success follows those adept at preserving the substance of the past by clothing it in the forms of the future my store wine library outsells big national chains how do you think we do it it started with hustle i always say that our success wasnt due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral but to the hours i spent talking to people online afterward making connections and building relationships i always say that the real success of wine library wasnt due to the videos i posted but to the hours i spent talking to people online afterward making connections and building relationships well you cant be trying to achieve success of any kind in this business without accepting that theres going to be a flip side to it hosting a tv show is a fulltime job in which success is defined by it never ending i think success has no rules but you can learn a great deal from failure success in the majority of circumstances depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed im starting to judge success by the time i have for myself the time i spend with family and friends my priorities arent amending theyre shifting a sign now of success with a certain audience when you do a short comedy piece anywhere is that it gets on youtube and gets around its always something youre thinking about unconsciously i mean we are tribal by nature and sometimes success and material wealth can divide and separate  its not a new philosophy im sharing  more than hardship hardship tends to unify in my time and neighborhood and in my soul there was only one standard by which a woman measured success did some man want her my definition of success is control if there is any secret to my success i think its that my characters are very real to me i feel everything they feel and therefore i think my readers care about them all business success rests on something labeled a sale which at least momentarily weds company and customer the whole secret to our success is being able to con ourselves into believing that were going to change the world because statistically we are unlikely to do it failures to heroic minds are the stepping stones to success how easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success evolution acts slowly our psychological characteristics today are those that promoted reproductive success in the ancestral environmen to be associated with success is absolutely wonderful success depends in a very large measure upon individual initiative and exertion and cannot be achieved except by a dint of hard work success produces confidence confidence relaxes industry and negligence ruins the reputation which accuracy had raised i was trying to uphold what i thought feminism was as best i could by supporting women by trying to create an opportunity to get women to get together play music together and celebrate the fact that we are having great success making music on our own and together if theres no fire theres no scream if theres no scream then no one hears you and no one comes to help you in the first place the depth of my struggle has definitely determined the height of my success to be able to teach my kids not just about success but about the struggle that comes with it put paying your dues and all that puts so much into being a success you have an understanding of what its about being on your own for three or four years and living day to day on 3 or living in an apartment with no electricity for example the equivalent of a woman being treated as a sex object is a man being treated as a success object the vampire was a complete change from the usual romantic characters i was playing but it was a success success sometimes can really bite you in the shorts with success came an evergrowing burden of responsibility i lived with a nearconstant lowlevel anxiety that i would make a mistake that would not only threaten my career but also my brothers  not to mention the livelihoods of many people who work with us or for us such a faith would be fatal to my reason to my liberty and even to the success of my undertakings it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave an instrument of the will and interests of others i passionately believe thats its not just what you say that counts its also how you say it  that the success of your argument critically depends on your manner of presenting it i was born with success lucky for me i am able to handle it also i damn well deserve it major success feels a bit like a coronation like id become a king i was one of the most famous people in the world loved and hated in equal measure i couldnt see anything bad with it it made me a happy person i think that everybody in the world whatever colour or creed has a jerk like jr in his or her family somewhere whether it is a father uncle cousin or brother everybody can identify with jr and that certainly had something to do with the success of dallas as his partner on this amazing journey i can tell you mitt romney was not handed success he built it sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth it is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character i gave up a lot of things in exchange for my success the success of watermark surprised me i never thought of music as something commercial it was something very personal to me thats the key to success isnt it it has to be fun theres that unwritten schism that literary writers get all the awards and commericals writers get all the success i think all of us certainly believed the statistics which said that probably 88 chance of mission success and maybe 96 chance of survival and we were willing to take those odds you know i can be the happiest man in the world with minimal record success i want to see success right away and i want to never give up never stop if you can go out with your live show and turn people on to that where you have that fan base thats religious and theyre going to come see you when youre in that town once your radio success is gone and youre not a mainstream guy anymore you can still go out and play your shows a man desires praise that he may be reassured that he may be quit of his doubting of himself he is indifferent to applause when he is confident of success success is not assured but america is resolute this is the best chance for peace we are likely to see for some years to come  and we are acting to help israelis and palestinians seize this chance when one has success the answer is not to undo that success it is to continue what has been done writers as they gain success feel like outsiders because writers dont come together in real groups firstperson narrators is the way i know how to write a book with the greatest power and chance of artistic success the first condition of success for the league of nations is therefore a firm understanding between the british empire and the united states of america and france and italy that there will be no competitive building up of fleets or armies between them one man has enthusiasm for 30 minutes another for 30 days but it is the man who has it for 30 years who makes a success of his life it never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business only to become a jerk you wanna know what scares people success when you dont make moves and when you dont climb up the ladder everybody loves you because youre not competition thought is the original source of all wealth all success all material gain all great discoveries and inventions and of all achievement it was a way out of poverty it was a way to success it was a way to education and it was a way to a brighter day for me i raised five children they all have different personalities all of them have different issues different levels of success that was a learning experience for me look if you ask a child would you rather have a fulfilled mother or a stayathome sylvia plath theyll pick sylvia plath every time but i think its really important that children dont feel their parents emotional lives depend on their success my literary success meant nothing to me i dont think success has changed us as people at all we are the same lunatics that we were when this band first got going we never see ourselves as being on a higher level than our fans the key to sitcom success is miserable people if you see a happy couple its just gone like when sam and diane got together on cheers if you can attribute your success entirely to your own mental effort to your own attitude to some spiritual essence that you have that is better than other peoples then that must feel pretty good the ever quickening advances of science made possible by the success of the human genome project will also soon let us see the essences of mental disease only after we understand them at the genetic level can we rationally seek out appropriate therapies for such illnesses as schizophrenia and bipolar disease success is the person who year after year reaches the highest limits in his field success is important only to the extent that it puts one in a position to do more things one likes to do we were called the toilets originally  we were flushed with success whenever i hear it cant be done i know im close to success it was very clear to me in 1965 in mississippi that as a lawyer i could get people into schools desegregate the schools but if they were kicked off the plantations  and if they didnt have food didnt have jobs didnt have health care didnt have the means to exercise those civil rights we were not going to have success success is finding satisfaction in giving a little more than you take we now live in a world where the only thing to have is success but failure is marvelous its fertiliser its like living fertiliser because youre forced on yourself without imagination we can go nowhere and imagination is not restricted to the arts every scientist i have met who has been a success has had to imagine everyone takes pause at 40 its the age you have to assess everything in your life its the fictitious marker thats always coming up when youre young the world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40 and be successful by 40 whatever success means my formula for success is rise early work late and strike oil winning in afghanistan is having a country that is stable enough to ensure that there is no safe haven for al qaida or for a militant taliban that welcomes al qaida thats really the measure of success for the united states im in the studio 24 hours a day its true that once you get a certain level of success you become a target talk magazine should be ashamed of themselves in a balanced organization working towards a common objective there is success one is never ready for success it consecrates and looses you at the same time its both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success i consider dr horrible a tremendous success the fact that it won an emmy i just think lends validity to what we were doing and the point we were trying to make taking the power into someone elses hands and changing the world but big oil and big coal have always been as skilled at propaganda as they are at mining and drilling like the tobacco industry before them their success depends on keeping americans stupid to burn always with this hard gemlike flame to maintain this ecstasy is success in life for movies to get greenlit solely based on the success of other movies that have a lot of women in them its so ridiculous to me i have decided to fight for my country because we have build a success story in guanajuato with real results and more yet to come in the next two years success tempts many to their ruin though i was excited about the sojourner truth play it was not reassuring to think that my entire future might depend on the success of that one show the real end winner of nafta is going to be mexico because we have the human capital we have that resource that is vital to the success of the us economy i feel true success comes from being able to work and the love for it people need to realise what real happiness and success is because success as an actor is fleeting you can be up there one day and gone the next my first attempt at a kiss was in fifth grade but it didnt go so well later i used boyz ii men and jodeci songs to come on to girls i had more success to this day most people think of me as the fastest human they dont really think me as a long jumper although thats the event i had more success in there is no correlation between a childhood success and a professional athlete mass communication radio and especially television have attempted not without success to annihilate every possibility of solitude and reflection id rather a young black actor read about success as opposed to how tough it was i get these roles because i can act and thats it hopefully thats it success is hard in general for most women we now have such busy lives and were told we can do everything  you know we can have the relationship and the marriage and the kids and the career four years of football are calculated to breed in the average man more of the ingredients of success in life than almost any academic course he takes ive had a lot of success over the years racing in new york but the main point is that i feel the marathon is a different event a lot more my event i did not become successful in my work through embracing or engaging in celebrity culture i never signed away my privacy in exchange for success the success of torn was a bit too much for me i took a year off and was still scared to start the second album happy people are ignoramuses and glory is nothing else but success and to achieve it one only has to be cunning you may lose your wife you may lose your dog your mother may hate you none of those things matter what matters is that you achieve success and become free then you can do whatever you like success is very ephemeral you depend entirely on the desire of others which makes it difficult to relax success comes in waves i cant imagine wanting to be famous just for the sake of being famous i think fame should come along with success talent we just want to win thats the bottom line i think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success but we dont really reflect on what weve done in the past we focus on the present there are so few women in general who arent completely threatened and confused by other womens success its very disappointing i dont understand why people whose entire lives or their corporate success depends on communication and yet they are led on occasion by ceos who cannot talk their way out of a paper bag and dont care to sometimes success comes in ways you dont expect i think that my biggest attribute to any success that i have had is hard work there really is no substitute for working hard you always pass failure on your way to success success listens only to applause to all else it is deaf theres nothing so aphrodisiacal for a woman as money and success the fhas success provides strong evidence that government can and should play a role in the nations mortgage finance system it also demonstrates that although government intervention in the economy during the great recession was messy things would have been a lot messier without it whatever success ive had i always like to top it were born with success it is only others who point out our failures and what they attribute to us as failure to win in australia for me has to be the ultimate success because the aussies live for sport a variety of national and international studies indicate that the broadbased deployment of information technology can have a substantial impact on our nations economic productivity and growth as well as the educational and social success of our citizens the fame of heroes owes little to the extent of their conquests and all to the success of the tributes paid to them all these people who say success changes people well no it just magnifies whats there success is not a destination but the road that youre on being successful means that youre working hard and walking your walk every day you can only live your dream by working hard towards it thats living your dream everyone applauds each others success in hollywood because they know how tough it is but it really comes down fundamentally to the process my ambition was to stop waiting tables that was how i measured success finally i was able to stop waiting tables and i was able to pay the rent and that was by being a standup comic not a very good standup comic but good enough to make a living i had come to the point when i realized it was unlikely that my film career was going to move beyond a certain level of role and i was  because i had graphic instances of it  handicapped by the success of star trek a director would say i dont want jeanluc picard in my movie  and this was compounded by xmen as well more people on unemployment benefits is not success in america fewer people on not because we kicked them off but because they have been able to get a job in the private sector because government got out of the way i think most people believe success in government is how many fewer people are in government not because you kick them off of benefits like unemployment but theyve been able to control their own destiny because private sector employers have created more jobs with the success of the last three or so years when a lot of people start treating you differently theres a danger that you may start to think of yourself differently you rely on your friends to say hey wake up if the film is a hit then everyone shares the success if it is going to be a disaster then it might as well be because of me not because of somebody else for the past few years i was the more visible asian performer and i think it gave young girls a kind of role model showing its possible to actually reach success doing movies i came from a family where i felt great pressure to be financially successful and i felt that staying in chicago and doing theater i was in all likelihood not going to find financial success for me i dont feel it is a success in the career to be the pretty woman career success comes from being characters who tell us something about the truth and really the basis i think of achieving some success in what i want to do today comes from my mothers push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education if i can procure three hundred good substantial names of persons or bodies or institutions i cannot fail to do well for my family although i must abandon my life to its success and undergo many sad perplexities and perhaps never see again my own beloved america ive always been too hard on myself to behave like ive arrived or even to enjoy whatever success ive had ive always envisioned myself higher than where i was and i still do with each success i think thats nice but im supposed to go there success is a process a quality of mind and way of being an outgoing affirmation of life for globalization to work for america it must work for working people we should measure the success of our economy by the breadth of our middle class and the scope of opportunity offered to the poorest child to climb into that middle class we had maybe the greatest success of any company that i know of in paris and after two or three years i wanted to do this same number that we did for pbs so we did it and paris had always considered us their darlings its hard for childrens authors to be accepted when they try to write adult books jk rowling is the exception because people are so eager to read anything by her but it took judy blume three or four tries before she had a success people of mediocre ability sometimes achieve outstanding success because they dont know when to quit most men succeed because they are determined to women face enough pressures and challenges in a workplace that is still depressingly biased against a females success add to that the fact that the very thing many women i know find most rewarding having kids is now frowned upon success is what you do with your ability its how you use your talent other peoples success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation ive always known i would be a success but i was surprised at the way it came nothing reinforces a professional relationship more than enjoying success with someone the first myth of management is that it exists the second myth of management is that success equals skill i dont want to wake up and be bored thats probably my greatest fear is to have nothing to do what better job is there than to play quarterback for an nfl team and certainly one that ive been on for a long time and had success with i dont plan on giving it up any time soon i thought doing reality tv would be the greatest success of my life or the biggest mistake nothing fails like success nothing is so defeated as yesterdays triumphant cause people repeat behaviour that leads to flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals the shortterm reward loop acts over hours to years and the longterm reproductive success loop over generations every success in limiting armaments is a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists and every such success thus supports the fight for international law and order success is 99 percent failure i have an idea of who i want to be i have a vision of my own success well i believe that the depth of your struggle can determine the height of your success i was inspired to come out of everything ive been through and end up in a place where i never thought that i would be success turns a lot of people off i have a pretty solid sense of joy and respect that irritates people and can irritate me too i always envisioned myself being a rapper and being in the game and having success but you never know what it feels like or how youre going to be when youre there girlfriend and 100 percent fun were my two peeks around 92 and 96 the reality is that the times i had the most media success sold lots of records and played bigger shows i had the least control of my own life i was successful materially but i know life is much more than worldly success i saw all these blessings god had given me the way to give thanks is obedience to god whenever you analyse anyone who has had any success and theyre in the headlines you will find they are human and make mistakes im certainly that and ive made a lot of mistakes at this point i cant say what network would be picking it up but i know that it would be a success i put pound150000 into the stage production of grease and have got back pound15 million so far it has been a fantastic success the only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion no one remembers anything else elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure i used to think that losing made you more hungry and determined but after my success at the olympics and the us open i realise that winning is the biggest motivation i dont like tommy on broadway at all i like the music im pleased with petes success but i dont like what theyve done to it picture yourself vividly as winning and that alone will contribute immeasurably to success my overnight success was really 15 years in the making id been writing songs since i was 6 and playing in bands and performing since i was 14 you should put time into learning your craft it seems like people want success so quickly way before theyre ready in hindsight i slid into arrogance based upon past success if you come into success too soon youll burn out and be finished before you know it if you let the maturation process happen naturally youll be happier with yourself in the end im a mum so my wardrobe consists of sweaters and jeans as long as i dont leave the house forgetting my jeans i count that as a fashion success im extremely ambitious i dont know why people are afraid to say that i wont sell my soul to the devil but i do want success and i dont think thats bad former olympians also get paid to make appearances many of them won their medals in an era when olympic success didnt go handinhand with financial success success comes to a writer as a rule so gradually that it is always something of a shock to him to look back and realize the heights to which he has climbed i just want to continue the success and be an athlete that is shown in a good light in new york city my wife elizabeth and i started the really terrible orchestra for people like us who are pretty hopeless musicians who would like to play in an orchestra it has been a great success we give performances weve become the most famous bad orchestra in the world i think people in botswana are pleased that my books paint a positive picture of their lives and portray the country as being very special theyve made a great success of their country and the people are fed up with the constant reporting of only the problems and poverty of the continent they welcome something which puts the positive side im astonished by my success its the price of success people start to think youre omnipotent the secret of my success is my hairspray success in whatever form it takes is a tricky thing  once youve achieved your goal then what where do you aim your chances of success are directly proportional to the degree of pleasure you desire from what you do if you are in a job you hate face the fact squarely and get out its nice being brought up with no money at all its just not how i measure success so that makes it a bunch easier taxation is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society the higher the tax level the greater the failure a centrally planned totalitarian state represents a complete defeat for the civilized world while a totally voluntary society represents its ultimate success immigrants provide skills that we simply cannot afford to do without they have contributed hugely to britains success independent films have a very different cachet than success films the delusions of selflove cannot be prevented but intellectual misconceptions as to the means of achieving success may be corrected i would love to be a guest on a talk show or a panel that shows women who have been on reality shows whove had success to prove to audiences that you dont have to be a fool to become successful when making music i sink myself into the process as deeply as i can and forget all of the success i think that everything you do helps you to write if youre a writer adversity and success both contribute largely to making you what you are if you dont experience either one of those youre being deprived of something the writing of a melody is an emotional moment success doesnt make it easy nothing good comes in life or athletics unless a lot of hard work has preceded the effort only temporary success is achieved by taking short cuts its an awesome responsibility not only to maintain the level of success the nfl has but to build on that fame and success are very different things its not just the nfl every other league has a draft it has been fundamental to the success of professional sports once you can accept failure you can have fun and success you can take elvis you can take marilyn monroe success and fame will not be the answer if something inside of you is bothering you if things in your mind arent going right
