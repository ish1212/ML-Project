to be one hundred youve got it made very few people die past that age i was a vegetarian until i started leaning toward the sunlight every man has his follies  and often they are the most interesting thing he has got never floss with a stranger i was sleeping the other night alone thanks to the exterminator the digital camera is a great invention because it allows us to reminisce instantly if god

changed the american child from an irresistable force to an immovable object to attract men i wear a perfume called new car interior have enough sense to know ahead of time when your skills will not extend to wallpapering ive never been married but i tell people im divorced so they wont think somethings wrong with me i have yet to hear a man ask for advice on how to combine marriage and a career i like marriage the idea i spent a year in that town one sunday my theory is that all of scottish cuisine is based on a dare god did not intend religion to be an exercise club my uncle sammy was an angry man he had printed on his tombstone what are you looking at i used to sell furniture for a living the trouble was it was my own retirement at sixtyfive is ridiculous when i was sixtyfive i still had pimples the four building blocks of the universe are fire water gravel and vinyl in hollywood a marriage is a success if it outlasts milk television has brought back murder into the home  where it belongs communism is like one big phone company theres nothing wrong with being shallow as long as youre insightful about it i dont have to look up my family tree because i know that im the sap theres no such thing as soy milk its soy juice who picks your clothes  stevie wonder theres a great power in words if you dont hitch too many of them together my father would take me to the playground and put me on mood swings when i go to a bar i dont go looking for a girl who knows the capital of maine i consider that a mans brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose i dont have a bank account because i dont know my mothers maiden name defy your own group rebel against yourself i dont deserve this award but i have arthritis and i dont deserve that either i rant therefore i am it is easy for me to love myself but for ladies to do it is another question altogether my wife has a slight impediment in her speech every now and then she stops to breathe when youre in love its the most glorious two and a half days of your life when the sun comes up i have morals again tell us your phobias and we will tell you what you are afraid of i grew up in europe where the history comes from progress was all right only it went on too long our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf the day i made that statement about the inventing the internet i was tired because id been up all night inventing the camcorder never put a sock in a toaster im going to marry a jewish woman because i like the idea of getting up sunday morning and going to the deli we need two kinds of acquaintances one to complain to while to the others we boast if i have to lay an egg for my country ill do it i may be a living legend but that sure dont help when ive got to change a flat tire i wish i had the nerve not to tip how long was i in the army five foot eleven the way taxes are you might as well marry for love i recorded my hair this morning tonight im watching the highlights i was born in very sorry circumstances both of my parents were very sorry people say that life is the thing but i prefer reading i can speak esperanto like a native ever notice that soup for one is eight aisles away from party mix every cloud has its silver lining but it is sometimes a little difficult to get it to the mint it all started when my dog began getting free roll over minutes miami beach is where neon goes to die why dont you get out of that wet coat and into a dry martini the best measure of a mans honesty isnt his income tax return its the zero adjust on his bathroom scale i have just returned from boston it is the only thing to do if you find yourself up there i cannot sing dance or act what else would i be but a talk show host i think serial monogamy says it all i quit therapy because my analyst was trying to help me behind my back i sang in the choir for years even though my family belonged to another church the one thing you shouldnt do is try to tell a cab driver how to get somewhere my mother was against me being an actress  until i introduced her to frank sinatra all my children inherited perfect pitch im thankful for the three ounce ziploc bag so that i have somewhere to put my savings whoever is my relative i will not be nice to them im a misplaced american but dont know where i was misplaced i would talk in iambic pentameter if it were easier parrots make great pets they have more personality than goldfish if man knew how women pass the time when they are alone theyd never marry here in hollywood you can actually get a marriage license printed on an etchasketch i have a very low level of recognition which is fine by me im kidding about having only a few dollars i might have a few dollars more id never been in play long enough for the flowers to die in the dressing room im the only man in the world with a marriage licence made out to whom it may concern someone told me that when they go to vermont they feel like theyre home im that way at saks trust is hard to come by thats why my circle is small and tight im kind of funny about making new friends i was asked to act when i couldnt act i was asked to sing funny face when i couldnt sing and dance with fred astaire when i couldnt dance  and do all kinds of things i wasnt prepared for then i tried like mad to cope with it there is hope for the future because god has a sense of humor and we are funny to god life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh from there to here and here to there funny things are everywhere its a funny thing that when a man hasnt anything on earth to worry about he goes off and gets married you know fame is a funny thing man especially you know actors musicians rappers rock singers its kind of a lifestyle and its easy to get caught up in it  you go to bars you go to clubs everyones doing a certain thing its tough design is a funny word some people think design means how it looks but of course if you dig deeper its really how it works forgiveness is a funny thing it warms the heart and cools the sting its funny how most people love the dead once youre dead your made for life its a funny thing about life if you refuse to accept anything but the best you very often get it but you cant focus on things that matter if all youve been is asleep for forty years funny how sleep rhymes with sheep you know i saw 28 days i dont remember rehab being like a day camp or being that funny rehab is a dumping ground its a big landfill its funny the way most people love the dead once you are dead you are made for life the most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds new discoveries is not eureka but thats funny everything is funny as long as its happening to somebody else its hard to be funny when you have to be clean im not funny what i am is brave if i studied all my life i couldnt think up half the number of funny things passed in one session of congress a mans got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book why is cloud 9 so amazing what is wrong with cloud 8 that joke came off the top of my head and the top of my head aint funny life would be tragic if it werent funny all these jokes have been preapproved as funny by me most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody elses expense and i find that thats just a form of bullying in a major way so i want to be an example that you can be funny and be kind and make people laugh without hurting somebody elses feelings i dont mean to be funny like almost everyone who uses email i receive a ton of spam every day much of it offers to help me get out of debt or get rich quick it would be funny if it werent so exciting its a funny old world im odd looking sometimes i think i look like a funny muppet it is funny that men who are supposed to be scientific cannot get themselves to realise the basic principle of physics that action and reaction are equal and opposite that when you persecute people you always rouse them to be strong and stronger i am oddlooking i sometimes think i look like a funny muppet comedy is simply a funny way of being serious god writes a lot of comedy the trouble is hes stuck with so many bad actors who dont know how to play funny screaming at children over their grades especially to the point of the childs tears is child abuse pure and simple its not funny and its not good parenting it is a crushing scarring disastrous experience for the child it isnt the least bit funny whatever is funny is subversive every joke is ultimately a custard pie a dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion i think being funny is not anyones first choice its funny how you never think about the women youve had its always the ones who get away that you cant forget it is not funny that anything else should fall down only that a man should fall down why do we laugh because it is a gravely religious matter it is the fall of man only man can be absurd for only man can be dignified to succeed in life you need three things a wishbone a backbone and a funny bone its always funny until someone gets hurt then its just hilarious you know the funny thing i dont get along with rich people i get along with the middle class and the poor people better than i get along with the rich people the best ideas come as jokes make your thinking as funny as possible i guess when you turn off the main road you have to be prepared to see some funny houses i got a lot of support from my parents thats the one thing i always appreciated they didnt tell me i was being stupid they told me i was being funny theres nothing cure or funny or lovable about being cheap its a total turnoff im blonde and tanned and normalsized im sweet shy funny have a big heart and im nice  and i like to eat i used to think that everything was just being funny but now i dont know i mean how can you tell as i get older all sorts of things become less funny once one has children any cruelty involving children becomes far less amusing than when one was at the mercy of ones friends and relatives children there is nothing funny about halloween this sarcastic festival reflects rather an infernal demand for revenge by children on the adult world i had everything id hoped for but i wasnt being myself so i decided to be honest about who i was it was strange the people who loved me for being funny suddenly didnt like me for being me its funny about men and women men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them women pay emotionally coming and going neither has it easy a funny thing happens in real estate when it comes back it comes back up like gangbusters i know some people say i can be funny but there is always a deeper meaning to what i say i am a socialist at heart and have the interests of the poor in mind when people see how i manage to work my way out of tough situations it gives them hope in their own life my grandchildren are fabulous and funny certainly there are things in life that money cant buy but its very funny  did you ever try buying then without money i could party in a cardboard box with people who are funny and dont care for me its really about who i surround myself with so i just try to always be with hilarious people chaos in the midst of chaos isnt funny but chaos in the midst of order is its a funny thing the less people have to live for the less nerve they have to risk losing nothing one of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys another sells and both think they are astute i dont care what the haters and naysayers say if they make jokes about me ill laugh because theyll probably be funny no matter how popular you are as a standup  you can go out and fill a 10000seat arena and be smart and funny  its delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that its not about you that its about the people who are nominated and respect that but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are ive always believed that there are funny people everywhere but theyre just not comedians in fact some of my best comedic inspirations were not professional entertainers i thought borat was a breakthrough comedy because it was really funny it wasnt some studioproduced script with 14 writers dirty rotten scoundrels is a good one because it not only turned out i think to be a really funny movie but it was also a delight to shoot we were in the south of france working with glenne headly and michael caine and frank oz the director  who were just fun you need to be silly to be funny you know how old i am im so old i remember when letterman used to be funny and it was presidents who were serious thats how old i am in my circle of friends ive always been loud and funny and talkative but as soon as i step out of that circle i get very quiet and introspective i dont want the spotlight on me i remember straightening my hair because i wanted to be like everybody else and now the fact that anybody would emulate what i do its just funny sixth grade was a big time in my childhood of hoops and friendship and coming up with funny things i got attention by being funny at school pretending to be retarded and jumping around with a deformed hand i think its funny to be delicate with subjects that are explosive life can be dramatic and funny all in the same day the middle class is so funny its the class i know best and its the class where you find the most pretension so thats what makes the middle classes so funny im smart and i can be really funny and interesting and i can go toetotoe with anybody in a conversation its to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business as it were and i use almost pure turpentine to start with adding oil as i go along until the medium becomes pure oil i use as little oil as i can possibly help and thats my method i had an idea of what i thought was funny its kind of based on how i am you know being relevant or coming up with something interesting funny to say about whats current is just as hard as it might ever be depending on the serendipity of it all it is funny the two things most men are proudest of is the thing that any man can do and doing does in the same way that is being drunk and being the father of their son thats what i hate about a lot of comedies when youre hitting a line or making it funny i read a lot of scripts that i just dont find very funny my hair has never been my greatest feature so that was funny enough unto itself that my hair became so focused on comediennes are the lucky ones because if youre funny you can be 125 years old and they will still accept you being funny is one of my greatest strengths i can make girls smile when theyre down and when theyre having a good time i can carry on the joke do you know its funny but i never thought of being blind as a disadvantage and i never thought of being black as a disadvantage if you play it straight its funny  the best comedy is always played straight down the middle the adjustment is understanding from the screenplay that a moment is hilarious keep your sense of humor my friend if you dont have a sense of humor it just isnt funny anymore funny is only something that others know about you  you cant be funny by yourself cheryl cole and katy perry are two of the hottest girls in the world  and so normal and funny with it if i was a few years older they are the kind of girls id like to date i want a younger version of cheryl and katy  a mixture of the two would be hot jon stewart is exactly the same guy hes always been only with money he knows that the moment he really believes hes important the funny goes away and he becomes bill oreilly except shorter and jewish stand up is really fun because if i think of a joke or a funny idea then i can just go and tell some people and if they laugh they laugh right away i think a lot of stuff i find funny is from day dreaming i think since i was kid people told me that they thought i was funny the comedians i liked were bill cosby and steven wright like just always as a comedic actor i always liked gary larson whos really funny for a cartoonist obviously its hard to lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse i wear black skinnyfit jeans  i cant get away from them its funny because i wore baggy jeans for ages then one day my friend convinced me to try on a skinny pair and i thought they were great i never smoked i never drank and i never took drugs the funny thing is nothing is more boring people like this for me its ok but most of my friends at least they smoke and drink one time i went into a restroom and a girl followed me in i signed an autograph for her in the sink it was pretty funny because she was in a guys restroom and she wasnt embarrassed at all the follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family their friends people who should be supportive going what are you talking about even just seemingly regular career paths but if its not what people expect for you they kind of react funny a good artist is willing to die many times over whats funny is ive died so many times hollywoods just not funny karaoke isnt fair when youre a comedian the whole idea is to get people laughing and enjoying themselves and im a professional funny guy its funny you succeed but now where are you gonna go from there ive got to keep proving that i can laugh or cry more real each time do i have a longterm plan kind of i have a general direction i think but its funny what comes down the pike the people i grew up around who i really liked were quick on the draw it always just wowed me and my mum would make weird funny comments i can see in myself her selfdeprecating hippie humour i cant take myself too seriously if you tell the truth about how youre feeling it becomes funny i know what germans are they are a funny people they are always choosing someone to lead them in a direction which they do not want to go i was so afraid to even read a paper in front of my classmates it is very funny because at that point my teachers would never have believed that i could speak in front of an audience of over 2000 people its funny when people say i dont think julia likes me honey if i dont like you youre going to know about it its funny how social activists usually protest against the only things that have a credible chance of achieving the activists goals if youre going to tell people the truth be funny or theyll kill you i think were all good and bad but goods not funny bad is funny suppress the good and let the bad out and then you can be funny its funny what a few nohitters do for a body as soon as you are trying to be funny or dramatic thats when things start feeling fake and boring whats funny is that the idea of popularity  even the use of the word popular  is something that had been mostly absent from my life since junior high in fact the hallmark of life after junior high seemed to be the shedding of popularity as a central concern i mean ive seen 3d films so far and i think its a long way to go before they replace actors its a funny thing with 3d i havent quite got it yet yet funny things happen to you in movies for silly reasons chris hemsworth is like christopher reeve in that he can do two things he can wear a big red cape without a shred of selfconsciousness but hes also funny as hell and hes so sweet so with all the fishoutofwater stuff hes so funny so he does almost two jobs in a way i like funny guys and those for some reason tend to be nerdy guys the nightmare is you spend the rest of your life being funny at parties and then people say why didnt you do that when you were on television the funny thing about me that most people never really understand is that at heart im really a jock i was a hoparound i hung out with the rockabilly crew the guys who were trying to be rappers the funny kids i wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning everything i buy is vintage and smells funny maybe thats why i dont have a boyfriend im a pretty funny guy and i would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys  moviestar guys where they could help me through it you cant really be strong until you see a funny side to things its only i have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now i know that im skinny because i know there are even smaller clothes in the store i think im big when i was big i never thought about it i like reading ball tongue lyrics and all that stuff and they published a book and i wouldnt give my lyrics and its all wrong in the book and i giggle its funny they say yogi berra is funny well he has a lovely wife and family a beautiful home money in the bank and he plays golf with millionaires whats funny about that i dont think im funny its funny but you get to a time in your life when you think you have all the friends you will ever have books are funny little portable pieces of thought its funny all you have to do is say something nobody understands and theyll do practically anything you want them to you have to discover when youre inadequate to be funny and you dont know youre inadequate when youre a kid i gave a funny speech at my wifes birthday party and im thinking hey ive still got it theres also a certain rhythm to the way jews talk that might be funny the funniest racism is the racism between minorities its something you dont see dramatized but almost every minority i know whos my age they have these funny stories about their parents stereotyping other minorities very often i dont make it through moments of recording because it is genuinely funny and absolutely ridiculous that a 60yearold grown man is making these noises i had the classic 40 meltdown i did its embarrassing it was pretty funny but then i recovered to me it was like a second adolescence hormonally my body was changing my mind was changing and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness life was a funny thing that happened to me on the way to the grave dont remember me as too nice or beautiful or funny because then youll be disappointed i dont like comedy i like funny things i dont like comedy like comedy movies are just oh jesus the funny thing is im not bothered or sad about being on my own  after all ive never had a husband light and funny has a more compelling quality when youre younger but i havent abandoned the genre i love falling down i love lucille ball its just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that i cant convincingly portray at this age i actually think of being funny as an odd turn of mind like a mild disability some weird way of looking at the world that you cant get rid of when i was a little kid i wrote this play about all these characters living in a haunted house there was a witch who lived there and a mummy when they were all hassling him this guy who bought the house  i cant believe i remember this  he said to them whos paying the mortgage on this haunted house i thought that was really funny sometimes i think what i write is funny in its quiet way actually i never did stand up im not that funny the funny thing is the girls that im always up against for roles are pretty nice and cool like emma watson shes awesome i love readings and my readers but the din of voices of the audience gives me stage fright and the din of voices inside whisper that i am a fraud and that the jig is up surely someone will rise up from the audience and say out loud that not only am i not funny and helpful but im annoying and a phony ive thought for the last decade or so the only actual place raw truth was seeping through in newspapers was on the comics pages they were able to pull off intelligent social comment pure truths not found elsewhere in the news pages and had the ability to make it all funny entertaining and pertinent i have only been funny about seventy four per cent of the time yes i think that is right seventyfour per cent of the time no no i was only funny on stage really i i think i was funny as a person toward my classmates when i was very young you know when i was a child up to about the age of 12 hemingway seems to be in a funny position people nowadays cant identify with him closely as a member of their own generation and he isnt yet historical i think the pattern of my essays is a funny thing happened to me on my way through finnegans wake its funny to be a critic i find it so funny that people find me so interesting great big serious novels always get awards if its a battle between a great big serious novel and a funny novel the funny novel is doomed weve seen some insane signs is that a loaf of bread in your pocket or are you just happy to see me funny stuff along those lines very original one just said i will do unspeakable things i thought that was very interesting  and mildly terrifying you know whats funny i dont ever feel the need to escape i have a strong marriage i like my life you hear about these guys having midlife crises  i dont see that happening to me i dont really get shaken very much people could heckle me a spotlight could go out i could forget a lyric im not operating on somebodys brain you know what i mean so i just think its all funny without hurting anybody we all tend to laugh at others discomfort when someone slips on a banana skin and falls its funny always remember your kids name always remember where you put your kid dont let your kid drive until their feet can reach the pedals use the right size diapers for yourself and when in doubt make funny faces i had to act in a school play when i was about ten years old i really didnt want to do it but everyone had to do it so i didnt have a choice a talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work its funny because id always known that i wanted a movie career i just didnt think that i would be in the movies im like bursting i should be working i dont want to take a break its funny on set i dont have to go to the bathroom i dont have anything wrong im perfectly fine so throughandthrough im not hungry im literally not even in my own body its a funny thing you want so badly for people to see what you do  youre proud of it  and i like the effect that movies have on people but the attention can also make me uncomfortable and i like to keep whatever is mine remaining that way its a funny little game to play and its a slippery slope i always say to myself im never going to give anything away because theres never any point or benefit for me its not an accident that both my sister and i are writers our parents created an accidental petri dish my family has great storytellers and i grew up in a very funny conversational house and didnt have television this small family farm was a bubble world that didnt have much to do with reality come out is so funny to me because ive never been in the word funny is a bit like the word love  we dont have enough words to describe the many varieties a romantic comedy has to be funny and make you think about life but the obstacle that has to be overcome is key theres something dangerous about whats funny jarring and disconcerting there is a connection between funny and scary some people can do things and get away with it comics are famously like that why is it that some guys can say the most horrible things and its not offensive its funny i always like to watch comics and its interesting that you can tell if someones funny in 10 seconds i guess now that i think back i used to play priest and be a funny priest i dont know i grew up in such a catholic family that i kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and i think i had fun watching my mom laugh comedys so subjective and if someone comes to watch doesnt get it doesnt find it funny then fine the funny thing is people wont let me pay for things ill be in a restaurant and the manager will say oh no its on the house the trick is always to write in pairs because if at least two people find it funny youve immediately halved the odds of it not being funny its not common for a woman on television especially if shes the mom of the family to be funny shes usually a straight man or foil i watch things that are fun or funny or interesting funny enough if you are looking at people these days who are putting botox in their face and getting all sorts of plastic surgery we look at them and go i can tell youve had botox i can tell youve had plastic surgery you look really strange to me but no ones saying anything were just accepting the fact that theyre strangelooking no one ever thought clint eastwood was funny but he was i mean i  its so funny i am you know i am you know a working woman out in the world but i still live with my parents half the time ive been sort of taking this very long stuttering period of moving out theres always an article coming out saying the new thing is funny women its funny i never considered that people are going to see me on the show and maybe stop me on the subway i never thought of myself as like a funny person literature has drawn a funny perimeter that other art forms havent the kind of funny irony is that a lot of people talk about ethical meat eating as if its a way to care about things but also not to alienate yourself from the rest of the world but its so much more alienating than vegetarianism im not funny people assume that because my books are funny ill be funny in real life its the inevitable disappointment of meeting me you find out in life that people really like you funny so what do you give em humor and then if you show them the other side they dont like you as much i find too that i can hide behind the idiots mask being funny and you never see the sorrow or the pain at the end of the day its got to be a good movie its got to be a funny movie and its got to make people think hey i couldnt have spent my time any better when youre out of sight for as long as i was theres a funny feeling of betrayal that comes over people when they see you again id like to do a film which is funny japanese people have a funny habit of abbreviating names i find it very easy playing bond i think hes hilarious he gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations at home in la sunday is lazy its the wife and me lying in bed with coffee watching the soup or something funny on tivo the kid will occasionally join us eventually breakfast is at a place down the street called patys and we always have some kind of great dinner  my wife makes a great roast beef what other people call dark and despairing i call funny the funny thing is that im the girl who no one sees at the beach ask anyone whos traveled with me normally im in so many layers i look like lawrence of arabia who do i like i am a big fan of french and saunders  not that that they are particularly standup i have to say but i think they have been great for women and they are of themselves just incredibly funny whether they are male or female the thing i thought about doing it was its comic relief and youve got to be funny so although i did try to sing properly it obviously has hilarious results when you cant sing i made a supreme effort not to do that thing that parents do which is to bore people without children to death by going on and on about how funny their children are so theres none of that hopefully i thought i was funny as a kid it used to be that you had to make female tv characters perfect so no one would be offended by your portrayal of women even when i started out on the office eight years ago we could write our male characters funny and flawed but not the women and now thankfully its completely different people dont want to listen to a celebrity tweeting about their charities and shows thats why comedy writers do well  we put out little funny ideas the reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks if my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor im just gonna tell her be a staff writer for a sitcom because theyll have to hire you they cant really fire you and you dont have to produce that much itll be awesome i dont hate humanity and im not interested in people who do although its funny actually some of my favorite writers really do like martin amis my dirty secret london fields is one of my favorite books ever and its indefensible but hes so funny i forgive him everything i used to say man i think id be a really good dad ill be a great provider im funny ill go on trips with them  ill do all sorts of stuff but the momming im not made for that i have a really good mom i know what she put into it its funny i do try to maintain health i started doing bikram yoga which is that hothouse yoga the 105 degrees yoga for 90 minutes its great you purge out all the sweat and youre drinking water its funny how many people will come to vegas to see your show where they might not come out to see you unless you come to their hometown its funny im a lifelong musician but because i principally play the piano its been a solitary thing our records if you have a dark sense of humor were funny but our records werent about comedy they were about protests fantasy confrontation and all that its funny how people who aint never been down there can think that america is so fair and that we should be alright its funny that the people who have their foot on our neck are telling us get up whats wrong with you its a funny show the characters are surprisingly likable given how ugly they are weve got this huge cast of characters that we can move around and over the last few seasons weve explored some of the secondary characters personal lives a bit more laurence olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts and the other way around because in a comedy you look for whats serious i think thats true sometimes things are really funny if youre absolutely earnest if youre really serious its hilarious i never know when i am being funny and the other way too i dont think you can think about that i dont think you can try to be funny some people are just funny i tend to head for whats amusing because a lot of things arent happy but usually you can find a funny side to practically anything the funny thing is dennis miller got me back into comedy im half jewish im half black i look inbetween i dress funny i play all these different styles of music on one record its like what is he doing the fans of the hunger games of the book are very passionate its funny even at my concerts there are people holding up cinna signs its funny how the music industry is enraged about the internet and the way things are copied without being paid for but you know why people steal the music because they cant afford the music its funny i can sit through the worst horror film ever made but even a quite good romantic comedy can drive me nuts lifes pretty funny when youre objectively on the outside looking at it people used to be funny about approaching me but now they seem to think im as sane as anyone whos done what ive done in movies can be you know you can touch a stick of dynamite but if you touch a venomous snake itll turn around and bite you and kill you so fast its not even funny i have this horrible sense of humor where i think discomfort is funny  partly because i experience discomfort a lot and its a way of laughing at it and getting a release i can never tell when something is funny i just have to do it onstage and find out my parents are very funny when they have to deal with anything racy or offcolor they usually pretend they dont speak english well i mean if a joke or humor is bawdy its got to be funny enough to warrant it you cant just have it bawdy or dirty just for the sake of being that  its got to be funny in this world everyone wants to know everything about you and i think thats funny im just not one of those naturally funny relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it i turned down some like it hot see how smart i am i felt i couldnt bring anything funny to it the outfit was funny i dont need to compete with the wardrobe i mean sometimes a comedian becomes an actor and they just dont deliver because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful and they get that mixed up sometimes or dont even notice that thats the thing i need to be cheered up a lot i think funny people are people who need to be cheered up boston is actually the capital of the world you didnt know that we breed smartass quippy funny people not that im one of them i just sorta sneaked in under the radar its not so much what you learn about mumbai its what you learn about yourself really its a funny old hippie thing but its true as well you find out a lot about yourself and your tolerance and about your inclusiveness i was lucky my family is wonderful and its funny because most of my best friends come from very large families so it always felt as if i had lots of siblings though in the end i had to leave them and go home i kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid i think there have always been funny women from carol burnett to joan rivers when the audience sees a woman they innately know shes worked twice as hard to get there shes had to prove that she can be the leader first and then be funny on top of it she has to emit a confidence that shes in control justin timberlake is everything and what more could you want in a person hes funny hes cute hes great he just understands i get him and he gets me and thats cool when humor can be made to alternate with melancholy one has a success but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time its just wonderful when human judgment and big data intersect there are some funny things that happen its funny when bands or younger musicians ask me so what does it take to make it well first explain to me what you mean by making it do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood i mean its funny playing music how of course you want it to do well you want them to like it but its not competitive like an election its the olympics its not a formula 1 race the billboard charts are just to show you what people like its funny how making odd noises can get you into strange situations sometimes i love things made out of animals its just so funny to think of someone saying i need a letter opener i guess ill have to kill a deer its funny  if you impersonate somebody they have no idea its them being funny it turns out is like being a bank its a confidence trick as long as everyone believes in you you are fine its funny as you live through something youre not aware of it maybe im delusional but im usually funny its not 100 but i have a pretty good batting average if joy behar or sherri shepherd was a dude theyd be off tv theyre not funny enough for dudes what if roseanne barr was a dude think wed know who she was its funny when youre a kid how you can acclimate to almost anything i sometimes lie awake at night trying to think of something funny that richard nixon said my father was always a straightup funny guy he was silly he was my inspiration as a writer or as a filmmaker you have to present yourself and part of what yourself is is what youre interested in or what you think is funny or what you think is sad or what you think is horrible people ask do you make a conscious effort not to swear  if youre doing silly stuff youre not tempted to put swearing in all the comics from my childhood who were funny without swearing were the people that influenced me what i do is quite traditional anyway i always find it kind of embarrassing kind of funny and kind of exciting in new york im recognized a lot although nobody says anything you know they stare at you just a second too long but in paris its not as commonplace to be recognized i dont think gee id like to dress this person there was a picture in us magazine it was a jersey dress and courtney love was wearing it i have this thing about courtney love this funny worship i grew up in a funny way i got to dress up in funny clothes and run around new zealand with a bow and arrow for 18 months how bad could that be it was always a fantasy of mine growing up  my favorite program was always little house on the prairie  so i always wanted to wear those looks when i was a child i wouldnt let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now whaddaya know every day im in a calico dress basically so its kind of funny something about new york man you can do more comedy there probably than you can anywhere in the world if youre interested in being funny new york is the place to go its funny with fiction  once you cut something it hasnt happened anymore i read the script for wonder boys and i said that was almost perfect it was so classy cool and funny its a really specific thing we stuck to it it turned out good and a lot of people liked it its funny that there was so much disturbance about having a catholic in the white house with kennedy and when we finally get a religion in the white house thats causing a lot of conflicts and concerns and disturbances for a lot of people its in the bush administration if you use tact you can say anything then make it funny i think chris rock at the oscars was a great example i thought that was intellectually hilarious the gap starts a war with banana republic that to me was funny id love to date somebody cool fun funny you know ive always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end im very silly as a person but quality silliness onscreen has more of an art to it harrison ford whom i was in morning glory with has mastered that dry funny better than anyone this is going to sound really funny i have a poster of zac efron on my wall i think every girl has a poster of him in their room so why not join the club im an unorthodox type of guy a funny guy  at least i think im funny and one of the things i like to do is come up with nicknames for myself hurried and worried until were buried and theres no curtain call lifes a very funny proposition after all in a funny way poems are suited to modern life theyre short theyre intense nobody has time to read a 700page book people read magazines and a poem takes less time than an article i dont have a caustic sense of humor what i find funny that humor comes from a much gentler place on the stage youre there its live theres a beginning a middle an end when something is funny you hear it right away some of the writers i admire who seem very very funny and very emotional to me can develop a closeness with the reader without giving too much of themselves away lorrie moore comes to mind as does david sedaris when they write the reader thinks that theyre being trusted as a friend i think a lot of humor is about distracting yourself pretend youre not trying to make it funny because for some reason the effort to be funny smells like sulphur in our culture its funny people often compare me to other humor essayists theyre usually quite nice comparisons i will accept those gladly but i am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other more chicky female writers and the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate queer eye for the straight guy is a form of service journalism to be successful i think it has to be a combination of a good story it has to be funny and it also needs to be packed with useful information with improv its a combination of listening and not trying to be funny for a culture that has such a problem with death we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way we see people shot killed and blown up and we find it funny and sexy and all those things but the reality of it is that every day people die and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it sometimes i feel like there are people just waiting for me to fall the funny thing is i cant give them anything i have just never been a partier even in school its funny when i saw the script in my inbox and it said sparkle i thought for real its really called sparkle i was wondering too how does jordin sparks as sparkle sound im so single its funny im usually a relationship girl i love being in love and having a partner in crime but its good to be your own partner in crime god that makes me sound like i have multiplepersonality disorder i think things are funny when the character is taking it totally seriously the word spanx was funny it made people laugh no one ever forgot it its painful for me to watch someone who isnt funny its horrifying to sit in the back and watch some guy who just totally sucks if you are a great dramatic actor then you often dont know if people are enjoying your stuff at all because they are sitting there in silence but with comedy its a simple premise if its funny people laugh if its not they dont the surprising thing is that i was not funny in high school i was always jealous of the funny kids because they always got the girls i couldnt tell a joke to save my life i dont really necessarily think im a funny guy but i like the opportunity to take on something that i dont feel im the best at doing im never afraid to try something if i think its funny and i know ill regret it if i dont here is my prescription to heal all wounds watch the film funny girl at least five times eat at least 45 chocolate bars and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex i truly believe that through a combination of nutella old pals and barbra streisand we can achieve happiness and very probably world peace my size has helped make me an amazing performer too the cliche of the funny fat friend i absolutely was that character  i am that character its a complicated bag of tools i acquired and ive put them all to work onstage it sounds funny but the 2008 olympics were something that just kind of happened and i was lucky they came at a point when i was uninjured and well prepared as a gymnast you cant ask for much more i think i have an inner confidence that my tastes are pretty simple that what i find funny finds a wide audience im not particularly intellectual or clever or minorityfocused in my creative instincts and im certainly not aware of suppressing more sophisticated ambitions funny things tend not to happen to me i am not a natural comic i need to think about things a lot before i can be even remotely amusing this may sound funny but as much as the today show matured me it also was something of a cocoon id been happy there i never went into the bosss office and pounded my fist on the desk saying give me more money give me a primetime show i think im funny because my family my siblings were funny its funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end i show them the funny part the silly part the laughing part the crazy part and then the really deep deep part where im talking from my heart to these people because ive been through everything theyve been through especially with a comedy youve got the clear cut goal of trying to make a scene funny its not like drama where youre trying to achieve some kind of emotion or trying to further the story along youre trying to figure out whats the funniest way to do something ive started looking at my own father a bit funny he assures me though that i really am the son of a scottish postman i dont know now if im funny i just keep talking and hope that i hit something thats funny in terms of the creative side of it its really been a thing where you come up with the funny stuff is usually at a bar or out talking to people or whatever its funny because i think a lot of it is simply weve never considered ourselves satirists but because were on comedy central and because were south park on comedy central we can do any topic we want no writing musicals is the hardest thing in the world and it was really funny because i remember when the south park movie came out there were some critics that said well its obvious that in order to get it to be 90 minutes they filled some time with music nothings funny about someone whos successful tv is easier its all planned out for you and the audience is there to see a show and they are all pumped up but when you are in a comedy club you have to be really funny to win them over its funny because im a sucker for glitz and glitter when it comes to clothes and nail polish but with my makeup im more comfortable with a natural look it feels more like me its funny because its funny im on so late im definitely the last seconds of anyones attention so i just want to give them something dumb to laugh at so they go thats funny then fall asleep i recently spent quite a bit of time in sheffield england which is where im from i wouldnt move back there but its funny when you spend a bit of time in the place where you were brought up you kind of realize how that place has had quite a big effect on you or made you a certain way i listen like mad to any conversation taking place next to me just trying to hear why this is funny womens restrooms are especially great i wash my hands twice waiting for people to come in and start talking i dont just try to be funny its harder to be funny if youre handsome than if youre very normallooking its just more relatable youre the underdog i mean its funny to see people struggle and you dont buy that brad pitt is struggling you know that guy could be the most skillless guy in the world but if you look like that you will be fine for the rest of your life its funny because i never think of myself as little miss alltogether when i was a kid i didnt feel like i fit in because  this is really silly and i probably shouldnt say it but i didnt think anything was funny so i used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my stepdad at the time and i didnt think anything was funny i couldnt laugh i realized my family was funny because nobody ever wanted to leave our house you know what i never really factor hollywood into anything im a black actor so i cant really control what hollywood thinks i gotta go do my thing and my jokes have got to be funny whatever i do has got to be great i really wanted to just be a musician i didnt want to be anything else but i was funny and all that for years i used to bore my wife over lunch with stories about funny incidents movies these days have made killers into funny people whats that all about ive got kids and family and friends and i dont like bad things i dont think theyre funny and its irresponsible to make movies that dont show you how thats not good i tell you its funny because the only time i think about hiv is when i have to take my medicine twice a day a comedians body is funny as well as his mind being funny his whole personage is funny i want to be in funny girl and i want ryan murphy to direct it it would be pretty funny to see a beverly hills white girl with mad rap skills being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you you feel that you mustnt get serious with people they dont expect it from you and they dont want to see it youre not entitled to be serious youre a clown comedy is not funny comedy is hard work and timing and lots and lots of rehearsals thats why i like to get out there and get people to see the other side of mitt and know us in a different reflection when you see the family and how funny he is with the boys and with the grandkids and you know just what a super guy he is thats part of what i am doing is letting people see the other side of mitt funny is funny memories are doing funny things to us my dad loved to laugh he was very funny and very silly europe is scooters europe is five young people on one bench sharing a chocolate bar their idea of entertainment and fun is so much different than ours which is exactly why a movie about them would be funny so thats why one of my rules of parody writing is that its gotta be funny regardless of whether you know the source material it has to work on its own merit people never ask people doing serious music do you ever think about doing funny music ive never really understood that its a funny thing people sometimes accuse us of condescending to our characters somehowthat to me is kind of inexplicable ninetyeight per cent of laughter is nothing to do with jokes which do not deserve to bear the weight of all the funny stuff in the world the history of the relationship between comedy and swimming is short indeed of course it is always funny when someone falls into water but thats about it married with children was racy it was sexist it was a lot of things but mostly it was funny my mother was a terrific force in my life wartimegeneration woman hadnt gone to university but should have done was very funny very verbal very clever very witty i was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible i felt i was deliberately being encouraged and i was overwhelmed its funny recently ive started to notice peoples impersonations of me and its basically like a hyperactive child its funny i actually made poorer decisions when i sobered up then when i was screwed up its funny having the same name as someone me emma watson and emma stone the amount of times ive been called emma watson or emma stone is so funny its just cause were all named emma none of us look alike i dont really have a type of guy i like its just like nice guys cute boys i mean ones that are funny but i think kiss kiss bang bang really got that thing where if a movie reads really funny and then has some dramatic or violent or sinister stuff in it you cant forget that primarily it has to be even funnier than you read it or that other stuff doesnt work i wish i could be as thin as jessica simpson i think she looks gorgeous i have had jessica on my show several times and i can tell you that girl is genuine and funny with a great selfdeprecating sense of humor and at the time it is funny how you can look at something and say for example with my shoulder injury when it first happened i said this is the worst thing that could happen to me why me why now now i look back and say it was probably the best thing that happened to me i think were the only jokeless show on television i mean really we have no setups and no punch lines its not a joke show there are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human weve got a bunch of new writers now who tell me they grew up watching the simpsons its bizarre and theyre writing some very funny stuff sometimes people get mad at the simpsons subversive story telling but theres another message in there which is a celebration of making wild funny stories i can always get better a lot of my exgirlfriends dont think im funny i didnt plan to be the rude middleclass comedian you write a certain type of joke that you find funny and mine happen to be often rude yes its juvenile but thats me only bad golfers are lucky theyre the ones bouncing balls off trees curbs turtles and cars good golfers have bad luck when you hit the ball straight a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky music is more difficult  try naming a political band the dead kennedys the dead kennedys are political but they are more funny than they are political we sit in a room for months trying to think of funny things i love a smart wellwritten show and 30 rock well you cant get any better than that tina fey poos funny theres nothing that she does that isnt funny that show is an example of how brilliant she is its so smart theyve done some brilliant commentary about the housewives with queen of jordan their showwithintheshow i am accusing him of stealing my best material he was a very funny man its unbearable when someone changes around you just imagine that your life partner changes then it is difficult to cope with or your mother or your father they were strong and now theyre like a baby  its not so funny funny games was conceived as a provocation my other films are different if people feel my other films are or respond to them as provocation then thats quite different funny games is the only one of mine where my intention was to provoke the audience when i first envisioned funny games in the mid1990s it was my intention to have an american audience watch the movie it is a reaction to a certain american cinema its violence its naivety the way american cinema toys with human beings in many american films violence is made consumable i have an inability to enjoy things but thats why were in comedy if we were happy we wouldnt be funny i guess for years its driven me crazy that women dont have better roles especially in comedies i know so many funny women but i always felt misogynist streak is too strong a term  but a dismissiveness i love funny people and when im with funny people or people who are amusing in their weirdness i love it because that to me is funny as opposed to someone who stops and says hey let me tell you a joke whats so great about working with really funny women is that vanity comes second whatever makes it real and funny theyre going to go for and its just great what i dont like is when i see stuff that i know has had a lot of improv done or is playing around where theres no purpose to the scene other than to just be funny what you dont want is funny scene funny scene funny scene and now heres the epiphany scene and then the movies over womens humor seems to be a little more supportive its just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people i respond to that i feel less like im going to get beat up in a room full of women than i do in a room full of guys its funny when people say you have sex appeal or call you the next brad pitt i just laugh im not that i dont want to be that by no means do i want to be a piece of meat for the rest of my career its funny when you get asked to do a talk show and then they follow it up with requesting you take your shirt off see i dont really go after girls most of the girlfriends ive had have come after me so its really funny when girls get offended because i dont hit on them its interesting that whenever i meet some of the other bond girls i always have something in common and it is an interesting sorority we all share about our bonds did your bond do that yes mine did so it is quite funny conversations we may as well be in high school you know stephen says in the movies no one ever goes to the bathroom they shave they brush their teeth he goes right at this sort of funny taboo we have about the bathroom and he turned it into this nightmare you know your worst fear of whats in there funny is an attitude my main point is to be funny if i can slip a message in there fine things can be funny only when we are in fun when were dead earnest humor is the only thing that is dead funny is not a color being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone i dont believe that anybody has come to a conclusion on why something is funny its funny because its ridiculous and its ridiculous for different reasons at different times there are so many funny women in the world and there has been for so many years so ill be happy when people can just move on from that and things can just be comedies and not female or male and everyone gets an equal opportunity but if something funny happens i cant resist i have to tell the people i would like to do something modern and possibly funny ive always enjoyed making people laugh but in order for me to be funny i have to get ticked off about something everyone comes up to me saying cooee julie hello as if i know them of course i dont bloody know them am i flummoxed by it sometimes i think ooh love go easy for a time i did feel this pressure that i had to be funny but it passes oh all the time when victoria wood and i did our series there were people asking can women be funny people still ask that its like asking can women breathe in and out i was the little funny one i felt i was the child among grown women its a real primal thing watching someone get hurt its funny and accessible its a funny thing  when im crazed with work spending time with my children relaxes me yet at the end of a long weekend with them the very thing i need to relax is a little work and time away from them its really funny because the same people who loved me as stringer bell were the same people that were watching daddys little girls literally in tears i had seen movies before that that had made me laugh but i had never seen anything even remotely close to as funny as richard pryor was just standing there talking i wouldnt totally rule out doing letterman or the tonight show if i had a set that i just happened to write that i thought was funny but was still appropriate for network censors but im not going to go out of my way the audience changes every night youre the same person you have to speak your mind and do the stuff that you think is funny and makes you laugh the misconception is that standup comics are always on i dont know any really funny comics that are annoying and constantly trying to be funny all the time i used to say i wanted somebody funny and intelligent but kindness is the most important quality in a man the great thing is that the funny side of getting old is fuel for my comedy i think its always funny when you see kids do shakespeare but with comedy its a simple premise if its funny people laugh if its not they dont hitchcock had a charm about him he was very funny at times he was incredibly brilliant in his field of suspense one lion thinks its just hilarious to tackle us hes very funny about it and we always know when it will happen working with chaplin was very amusing and strange his films are so funny but working with him i found him to be a very serious man whereas the films of hitchcock are macabre he could be a very funny man to work with always telling jokes and holding court of course when i worked with charlie he was getting older i actually find novels that are determined to be funny at every turn quite oppressive its funny though with films because you can incorporate a variety of elements and sometimes that can work for you and sometimes i think it can work against you comedians dont laugh theyre too busy analyzing why its funny or not what was really funny is that as i got older all those guys who called me a sissy in junior high school wanted me to be their best friend because they wanted to meet all the girls that i knew in figure skating i cant not find humor in elements of most parts of life but at the same time nothing ever seems perpetually funny to me and in a funny way each death is different and you mourn each death differently and each death brings back the death you mourned earlier and you get into a bit of a pileup also in a funny way if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies people often ask me how i make things funny i dont make things funny if you work at comedy too laboriously you can kill whats funny in the joke for some reason and i dont know why but i dont think that im funny in california so i always want to do my movies east somewhere i took ps i love you thinking it was going to be a little funny and i ended up crying every day on that film i think saturday night live starting in the 1970s really gave women an outlet to be funny a lot of those women went on to have film careers from kristen wiig now to tina fey and gilda radner i write about wounds the eternal treasons of life its not very funny but its sincere my commitment is to sincerity when i was doing ensemble theater and comedy work i felt i had some talents but when i started doing my shows in berkeley and found that i could be funny on my own i was shocked memory is funny once you hit a vein the problem is not how to remember but how to control the flow people just dont laugh when their family is violated and you dont shrug it off you band together and you defend together its a funny primitive instinct theres always something funny about men chasing women i dont know who the hell paul lynde is or why hes funny and i prefer it to be a mystery to me politicians talk in generalities and lies and i think theyve caused all our grief theyre so awful theyre really funny i hate thinking this because my dad loved politics as soon as i realized you could be funny as a job that was the job i wanted i think when you do comedy you play by a different set of rules no one really wants you to be in that good shape being in good shape implies a level of vanity that isnt necessarily funny to me what separates a funny movie from a good movie is something personal i cant watch other people doing comedy as soon as somebody starts being funny i have to turn off because it upsets me i get comedy indigestion i just hate anybody else being funny thats my job as a fiveyearold in berlin in 1965 i didnt know that funny women existed it wasnt until i got back to england that i realised women could be funny leno conan they are both really funny they really know how to land one straight men just cant imagine the bliss of being in a relationship with someone who finds farting as funny as they do we live in a funny time if you dont go corporate you cant compete youre relegated as irrelevant people used to admire that you cant teach somebody how to be funny youre either funny or you aint the things that make me angry still make me angry george carlin is 67 and hes still as funny as hes ever been and hes still angry and that makes me feel good because i feel like if i stick around long enough ill still be able to work the fact that the kardashians could be more popular than a show like mad men is disgusting its a super disgusting part of our culture but i still find it funny to make a joke about it funny people is my favorite performance of myself to date even though its a comedy and there are serious moments i really felt like leo felt like a real person it didnt feel like i was playing myself whether its a comedy or drama i just try to make it as realistic as possible i dont want to be the one to break it to you but the future aint that funny twitter to me works if youre funny twitter doesnt work as a promotional tool unless you do it very very very occasionally ive been to many funerals of funny people and theyre some of the funniest days youll ever have because the emotions run high i think a lot of times on tv we see caricatures  thats whats funny i love being a dad it keeps me fit and inspired and children are so funny they always supply you with acting material its funny how most activists are pacifists ive always been part of comedy one of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other particularly my two brothers and myself when my father was upset with something youd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh because when he didnt laugh you were in trouble so what i do now is to preempt that by making the up into a virtue and telling funny stories about how crap i am before people have a chance to notice it for themselves and think maybe i havent realised if you think somethings funny go with that most comedians pull jokes from a place of honesty funny is funny is funny i really dont know what makes a comedian i think its a family background and environment yet if you put the same ingredients in another person he may never utter a funny line you can go to a play that is enjoyable because its funny and then on the next night you can go to a play thats enjoyable because its disturbing i dont happen to have a sense of humor personally so i dont know whats funny about a character this happens to be a feature of my life generally i was making my living from a joke about my appearance that i didnt understand and in a way still dont because when i look in a mirror it doesnt seem funny to me for some reason people find me funny its quite hard to define why a thought is funny its even harder to define why a person would be funny its a word that i cant define at all but whether i know quite what it is or not i seem to be it we all know funny people who cant get it down on the page  even funny writers who cant get it down on the page if its inappropriate to write about if theres nothing funny about it then its not funny its funny how a chubby kid can just be having fun and people call it entertainment sometimes comics will make the observation that its not jokes that are funny its characters that are funny and isnt that true thats why i always kill jokes im terrible at them because i get the joke right but i cant get the character right and it just goes down like a lead balloon i would call it a comedy variety show we have some people just doing straight standup we usually try to have one musical act of sort so its just people being funny in different ways not just sketch not just standup not just characters all of those things animals are sentient intelligent perceptive funny and entertaining we owe them a duty of care as we do to children strange questions are the more interesting ones children by and large dont try to trip you up they want to find out how you do this funny thing that you do if theyve loved a story they love to know how it started its so funny because right now im very tired and my brains a little dead i tend to get very focused and serious so im probably coming off a lot more like scully right now i tend to play characters that i can infuse with certain kinds of humour even the baddest guy can be funny in his own particular way i want the audience to engage with the character on some deeper level so that they leave the cinema still thinking about him its a required part of your film history to know who woody is his movies are so wonderful and not just funny but so insightful about human behavior i have no idea what im going to say when i stand up to give a toast but i do know that anything i say i find funny you know whats funny to me attitude some people say funny things but i say things funny we are supposed to enjoy the good stuff now while we can with the people we love life has a funny way of teaching us that lesson over and over again i also think if youre an actor and you can improvise when you go on an audition and you can improvise youre just a genius if you can you know take a tide commercial and you can just say one funny line thats not in the commercial they think youre a genius most of the gaffes ive made have not been funny  theyve been stupid my little dog he did not get ill it is so funny that people get ill on a boat and dogs do not who knew rob lowe was funny on parks and rec weve got some of the funniest comedy writers some of the funniest comedians in the world working there and if anything we dont just effuse to one another and be like oh rob lowes really funny if he wasnt the american audience has really opened up to women being a funny and b kinda crude bridesmaids is rrated and i think it was a major coup for women to have an rrated comedy that did really well same as bad teacher its interesting  i always thought when i was doing more melodramatic stuff like everwood that the directors were constantly reeling me in and stopping me from being funny the key is just to ignore the pain because physical comedy only works if you see someone get hurt and they arent actually hurt if someone gets hit in the face with a bat falls down and gets back up its funny if they stay down and their jaw is wired shut in the next scene its really tragic and weird you have to pretend it doesnt hurt its a funny relationship that makeup artists have i always feel kind of like a dentist people look at me and think of pain i love charlie billy burkes character writing for him is so spectacular hes so funny and wry and every scene hes in he just takes theres a scene in eclipse where bella tells him shes a virgin and its the funniest most awkward scene ive ever seen on film its funny how i use social media because i dont use it to promote my restaurants that much i use it for social issues and i think thats what its for i do a few things  i mess around with music a lot because thats a passion of mine if something strikes me and i want to share it i do he is very dry but also very funny i think people tend to feel odd when i do my act unless you are an ironic person its not a good place for you to be you know the funny thing about lorne and that show is that you can go over one million things but in a business of bean counters he still likes to laugh at small things and creates a show around it everybodys funny in different ways marie antoinette was funny im sure she was just misinterpreted you know the let them eat cake line she seems like she was kind of funny like a chelsea handler or kathy griffin type you cant make everybody laugh you gotta just do what you think is funny just be obstreperous to everybody you know how it is with writing you just write what you want to write theres no way to predict what is good or bad you just do what you think is funny and either it works or youre finished its impossible to predict anything ive dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do but these things have become part of my process i think the things i do for my appearance help make me look better i even colour my hair because i like how it makes me look im terrible at practical jokes i do them too well so theyre not funny i end up saying oh no im joking im joking everybodys funny if you love them people dont realize that im really funny and im an excellent bridge player people say funny things all the time during really serious moments in life i had a very funny family i think i would say the kings speech is surprisingly funny in fact the audiences in london toronto la new york commented theres more laughter in this film than in most comedies while it is also a moving tearjerker with an uplifting ending the funny thing is that i write and i act a lot about being jewish but i dont really think about it as a regular person its funny when people talk about the 70s i can tell you the year of every album but when it comes to the later efforts i cant remember the exact years its funny isnt it ive always found it easier to be funny than to be serious and the funny thing is ive always been an optimist  its practically a congenital disorder with me its funny how intimate it feels to get a text i knew exactly what to do on alien it was funny i come more to scotland than i ever used to so i feel more connected to it more part of the zeitgeist you know when you realize you have a choice and im choosing my homeland its funny when you get older these things creep up to you its funny because when youre younger youre in a rush to be 18 or 21 or whatever but then you hit 30 and now the days go by like hours you think 40 man this could be the halfway point it could be the threequarters point you know who knows im one of those hovering mothers and i know its really important to have an independent child so im trying to back off but its hard i love him so much and hes so funny and cute to me i actually was class clown but i dont know how that happened because ive never been considered an outwardly funny personas the people in this room will attest i actually was class clown but i dont know how that happened because ive never been considered an outwardly funny person comedy is surprises so if youre intending to make somebody laugh and they dont laugh thats funny scream was great for what it was for a horror film it was intelligent it was funny it took a laugh at itself when i was a kid i wanted to be serious like daniel daylewis no one really dreams of being a comic actor do they now i realise how stupid that is  and its because comic acting isnt taken seriously enough its a discipline you know instantly  either youre funny and getting the laughs or youre not i think theres something in the fact that its hard to be good looking and funny you have to have an oddball quality people have to sympathise with you to find you funny one of the things i like about acting is that in a funny way i come back to myself for a catholic kid in parochial school the only way to survive the beatings  by classmates not the nuns  was to be the funny guy its sort of an action flick you cant be that funny trying to steal diamonds i do find comedy difficult i dont know why maybe i think about it too much theres a tremendous amount of pressure to be funny i think sometimes my humor is extremely dry and a lot of times i would say things that i thought were very funny but i have a reputation of  people think of me as a very fundamentalist humorless fellow i dont dismiss the music that i was involved with i dont think it was a joke i dont think it was funny or a phase i dont think it was just something i was doing back then to me it was who i am it connects all the way through i dont distance myself from any of it even as a kid i was never the generator of humor but i always knew who was funny who to hang out with in italy i had an afro and a lot of the kids came up and felt my hair it really was funny i wish i had understood italian i think a lot comes from having the experience of doing standup comedy it allows you to figure out the psychology of an audience what things are funny and not life is funny and it is interesting how we make it as serious as possible its funny though speaking of fathers and sons because me and john goodman played father and son like five or six years ago in the film death sentence and i got back with him again in inside llewyn davis its funny that i got to do on the road because the thing that had the biggest impact on me growing up was reading books i was very inspired by the book and this spirit of dean moriarty and how envious we all are of somebody who can be that carefree its funny  i read that women look to chiseledfaced guys for onenight stands and to roundfaced guys for marriage when im rounder in the face i like to say this is my longterm look or this is my wifeandkids look right here this is the great thing about northern ireland i walk down the street and people stop me and say things like i know you youre that wee golfer arent you i say yeah thats me they say keep it up wee man its very funny and thats why i want to stay here as long as possible i have an alljapanese design team and none of them speak english so its often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation the most important thing is to write material that you think is funny if you dont think its funny but youre convinced that other people will think it is well they wont when it comes to war we focus more on the mainstream coverage of the event rather than the event itself people dying is never funny protest puppets are always funny i think that obama is very cool and i think hes clever and i think he can be witty but i dont think hes funny in either the way that reagan was funny  or john mccain and dick cheney are both funny in that ruthless kind of mean way we want to be funny we want to make people laugh well do whatever it takes but sooner or later id love to do a comedy i mean i think that you know people dont think that thats in my wheelhouse because ive sort of played a lot of dramatic stuff and thats certainly a side of myself that i want at some point in the right context in the right stuff that i find really funny i love nerds comiccon junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow isnt that funny the tables have turned i think the cold war works as a great analogy or simile for different kinds of conflict its funny when you look back at it its one of the last times that the boundaries were clear now as we see on homeland there are no clear boundaries and enemies i always just wanted to be funny i never really planned to be scary i started writing when i was 9 years old i was like this weird kid who would just stay in my room typing little funny magazines and drawing comic strips the token gay character is always so funny and so fantastic thats happened a lot or theyre often purely victims you cant be funny if you dont have good material i have funny bones if theres ever any kind of tension ill always be the one to try and be funny to loosen things up its funny  nowadays people that are famous get chased by paparazzi they have this fame but they dont have the money to hide from it being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone a broader character that i try to humanize a kind of silly or wacky persona that i try to fill in you cant be funny for funnys sake you try to get as outrageous situation as you can but it always has to be believable and based in real character motivations and what people would really do its funny because i sometimes feel that im most creative when im pregnant johnny rotten hes a big fan of mine i used to see him out in the audience in england and hed stand up and holler hes funny smart too and a nice guy dont think hes a jerk because he isnt if people want to compete for leadership of a religious group they can compete in piety a chilling thought or funny back in the 70s like one of my favorite movies ever was the bad news bears and that was a kids movie but i dont think of it that way i think of it as just a great movie because walter matthau was so funny and so harsh with those kids i just couldnt go back to suddenly susan after david stricklands suicide i didnt see how we could make the show light and funny any more its funny now how much we look at  whatever you want to call it art design culture stuff film  online and how in the online world youre instantly global one can always come up with funny lists and jokes you know what i take it back not everyone can always come up with funny lists and some jokes im very lucky to have a gift where i can do that pretty ably people forget how outcast they might be giants can be they have a reputation for writing really deft funny clever melodies and they also make a lot of music for kids which is terrific but when you see them in concert they can rock the house its so funny looking back but my socalled overnight success actually took 15 years i remember when i didnt have any money and my only car was moms hyundai mmmm the comedy that matters is the comedy you pull out of thin air its a bit like when something funny has happened and you try to explain it to someone else and end up saying you had to be there plus i love comic writing nothing satisfies me more than finding a funny way to phrase something its funny because im a man of strong opinions and when i make one i stand by it even if it starts to appear incorrect to me after a while i think i have a dark view of the world i have to make everything funny otherwise it all seems so sad its sad and upsetting when you see somebody crying hysterically but at the same time its real funny well in the book carrie was my alter ego in real life sarah jessica and i dont look anything alike but people do say that we sound alike sarah jessica is an adorable girl and she is very funny i think if actors dont think of themselves as funny in real life they think they cant do comedy i joke around a lot about the manic times because theyre funny we manics do outrageous things and it is part of our colorful nature i like all jim carrey films theyre really funny yes i believe blue material is funny but if thats all youve got youre dead in the water its not good im not a very serious person you know how they say that clowns are very funny in public and are really sad at home im really kind of stupid at home and more serious in public its funny because i did all of these interviews as soon as i had the baby and they were asking questions and i really didnt have an idea of anything because i was so blurry thats a funny thing fame people definitely do treat you differently when you begin to be successful people say dont go changing well thats easy to say but the fact is you dont change at all  other people do i tell girls all the time that the men that have fallen in love with me have all fallen during a man repeller stage funny how life works out like that i think its really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there its funny to me that were expected to keep quiet just because of who we are why do i lose my right to speak my mind because im famous im not a movie guy im not a tv sitcom guy but whatever seems to fit and is funny is good for me you have to understand the tone of the movie because if its supposed to be funny it can be funny violent like the home alone stuff but you have to really understand the tone of what youre doing and make the action work for that and for the character i really love soapdish i wish soapdish had more of a moment because i felt that that is a really strong funny movie kevin kline is hilarious in that movie i dont know i think its funny i think its funny i go what its so absurd im alone its funny that all these goths paint their faces with such white makeup and that is the actual colour of my skin i am that pale to this day ive found that it doesnt matter what a guy looks like if hes really funny his sense of humor makes him attractive on the other hand you dont hear men saying no shes not pretty but is she ever funny everything seems fine until youre about 40 then something is definitely beginning to go wrong and you look in the mirror with your old habit of thinking while i accept that everyone grows old and dies its a funny thing but im an exception to that rule its funny but when i arrived in california to start college i was much more interested in becoming a surfer and cruise along in life from one beach to the next i didnt plan out any huge career for myself i was going through a little bit of turbulence in my career and so its funny how turbulence itself will make you hold onto something for security and so the only thing i knew is trust in the lord and lean not unto your own heart in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path i actually feel like for a lot of my career i wasnt able to show my comedic range i did a lot of dramas and dramedies i was on er thats not generally thought of as a funny show i have an older sister named haley and she wanted to be an actress so i wanted to be an actress its really funny the way that some people dont give kids enough credit for like really being driven and really wanting to do things so badly if im in something funny i like to try and find some kind of serious line in it that people can relate to if you could cross a lion and a monkey thats what id be because monkeys are funny and lions are strong im good at coming up with wacky characters and funny dialogue comedy clubs can be brutal those people are for real and if you arent funny they arent laughing they dont care who you are gotta stay in the gym stay funny stay sharp i just love working i think its actually a misperception that i am a comedic actress i do more drama than comedy but very little of it has been seen when you are in big funny movies and they do well and your little part in it kind of explodes people perceive you as a comedian i dont think of myself as a comedian but as an artist a scientist and chemist who just happens to be funny i started doing standup to add another level to my game i feel that im a young rookie with a veterans skill i feel cheesy when i see silver spoons some of it was funny but some of it was just cheese my kids love it but i look at it and cringe ive got to get on myself to be sharp funny and loose sometimes i am so dry that people dont know im kidding and think im being serious i enjoy this because their reactions are often funny i would love to play funny girl or evita but i idolize the women who have played those parts i dont know if there needs to be another version of those shows i understand a woman who validates herself by getting attention from the opposite sex i have a friend who is that to a t doesnt mean she isnt a good person thats a funny character to play at school i was very shy i wasnt funny really i love weird or funny or beautiful sentences joy williams could write a microwaveoven manual and im sure id love it because the sentences would be tuned up like music i remember listening to the radio as a kid and finding that the songs always made me feel more peaceful funny but the more hurtin the music was the better it made me feel i think of that now when i write my songs i may not be feelin the blues myself but im writing them for other people who have a hard life what was funny if you were there is that we were all immensely sophisticated people who knew exactly what she was going to say and were chatting away nice to see you im so unprofessional on set its not even funny its funny that it all becomes about clothes its bizarre you work your butt off and then you win an award and its all about your dress you cant get away from it i follow the most random people on twitter i follow famous people like khloe kardashian who surprisingly makes really funny tweets all the time i was not particularly bright i wasnt very athletic i was a little too tall odd funny looking i was just really weird as a kid i think its so funny when people think they cant control a movie star they can were just women you know i always approach comedy roles pretending they arent funny i feel funny about owning art i dont really want to say wow come and see my monet  its in a dark room at the bottom of my cellar i love mikhail bulgakov he is very original and takes the story to unexpected places i didnt realise political writing could be so funny and theres a visceral fun in watching team america and making it like taking a puppet and throwing it against the wall because its not cg theres something funny about it so often i read scripts and am like this would never happen in real life its not trying to be funny its trying to be serious acting is all about big hair and funny props all the great actors knew it olivier knew it brando knew it billy crystal knows how to make people laugh hes got 30 years on stage theres no telling him whats funny im not a believer in the pratfall i dont think its funny just to have someone fall down they did that little thing on south park and they mentioned my name and had a character of me judging a halloween contest it was really funnythat made me the coolest aunt on earth theres a constant flow of child actors its kind of funny to watch the new crew come through i think you poor little things youre going to have to struggle for a long time its funny growing up there was never anybody around me with any kind of artistic bent when i was in college i was in the theater department which for anyone who has been involved in any kind of theater program you know that its really wacky and tightknit a real family me and my good friends from college would do random shows and plays that were sometimes serious but most of the time really goofy and funny with portlandia i dont think our intention is always to find something funny sometimes the humor comes from taking something really seriously were okay with making somebody feel uncomfortable or uneasy i got to play with nintendos wii yes its a funny name and not very revolutionary but it was fun whipping your arms around jon stewart hires people that he thinks are funny thats it thats the only requirement it is possible in this world to be pretty and funny and successful all at the same time i think its always funny when somebody thinks youre going to do something super sexy and then you dont sometimes in the most tragic situation something just profoundly funny happens and i think that being able to make people laugh and write a book thats funny makes the information go down a lot easier and it makes it a lot more fun to read easier to understand and often stronger so theres all kinds of advantages to it it is funny what a year can do its funny in a way the actor is a writer its not like the two things are so separate as to be like apples and oranges the writer and the actor are one stealing youll go far in life actually there is something funny about getting away with it movies dont look hard but figuring it out getting the shape of it getting everybodys character right and having it be funny make sense and be romantic its creating a puzzle yes having been a writer for so long i have an awareness of when things are going awry but it doesnt mean i know how to fix them i can do comedy so people want me to do that but the other side of comedy is depression deep deep depression is the flip side of comedy casting agents dont realize it but in order to be funny you have to have that other side whats funny is my husband doesnt have any tattoos at all so he must be the very conservative one i watched a lot of silent directors who were absolutely great like john ford and fritz lang tod browning and also some very modern directors like the coen brothers the directors take the freedom within their own movies to be melodramatic or funny when they chose to be they do whatever they want and they dont care about the genre what i fell in love with as a child was my fair lady funny face american in paris and singin in the rain just perfect movies to me and i was dancing i started ballet when i was three and i fell in love with those movies and fell in love with audrey hepburn and leslie caron my job is mostly to entertain and be funny sometimes you have to take the focus off of you and put it on someone else and its funny what you can accomplish and how much strength you really have i dont think i was funny until college i lived with some harvard mdphd students  they were so smart and what i contributed to the house was i was the funny one when i was younger i wanted to be a big movie star whod get to be funny on talk shows and then i wanted to retire and write science fiction when you are not treated seriously you develop comically its sense of oneself is so fractured and fragile that its like the pickedon kid who has to become funny i got pregnant at 40 by surprise its funny because when we found out we were pregnant i said okay lets experience that you just have to just go with it because its rare billy is a funny cheeky lovely boy and i love being with him parenthood is terrifying though i can barely walk past a building without panicking that its going to collapse on his head the funny thing is the songs that people think are about me probably arent and the songs that are probably are the ones they wouldnt think so thats where it kind of is funny funny i dont feel any more powerful today than yesterday the islam of the 18th 19th and first half of the 20th century was a poor thing nobody bothered about it islam was that funny sort of pure system of beliefs that depressed people in the middle east held as their religion most of my ideas just come out funny sometimes laughing isnt the best judge of whats funny cause i think theres a lot of things that are really funny that dont make you laugh that dont make you physically audibly make a noise but is something that is much more powerful than that there is nothing funny about a welladjusted intelligent person making the right choices im always in situations where you cant be funny and yet i want to do it anyway its a funny thing about me i dont have any interest in food most of the time now although when i was a kid i was always hungry i wasnt even 20 at the time but it taught me something about drugs they can take a good man a warm funny loving family man and turn him into a loser and worse i believe in a funny way the job of the novelist is to be out there on the fringes and speaking for an experience that has not really been spoken for funny how moms can tell you what to do no matter how old or big you are i didnt grow up identifying with beauty i grew up thinking i could be smart and funny  those are the things i got feedback on inappropriateness is funny to me rudeness is hilarious i think if they put a laugh track on intervention it would be funny we all know how funny morrissey is actually you know what i say that sarcastically his songs are some of the funniest songs ive ever heard in my life i mean really i mean not that the girlfriend in a coma is like really funny when i was in high school i used to sit by myself in the cafeteria  not necessarily by choice  but i thought it was funny to talk to people that werent there laughter is involuntary if its funny you laugh whats funny about that is when i was writing twilight just for myself and not thinking of it as a book i was not thinking about publishing and yet at the same time i was casting it in my head because when i read books i see them very visually i auditioned for a solo in church and got it i was about seven and i sang a song called jesus i heard you had a big house and i remember people standing up at the end and me thinking oh i think im going to like this thats how it all began sounds funny to say you got your start in church but i did its so different when you change your hair color youre treated so differently its a very funny experience its fun  i love changing up my hair im a big fan of certain new acts i love any genre of music and i think its really great to see that there are new artists coming through its kinda funny to think that im like the old man on campus now but im really happy for groups like one direction i think theyre really good guys when i turned about 12 or 13 i realised that being funny wasnt about remembering jokes it was about creating them theyre great girls theyre very funny theyre very smart theyre fun to be with theyre very lively as i think people can tell and you know theyre very confident girls and regardless of the fact that in this country certainly in the arts we treat comedy as a secondclass citizen ive never thought of it that way ive always thought it to be important the last time i looked the greeks were holding up two masks ive always thought of it not only as having equal value but as the craft of it being funny its funny but we were living on this small island off the coast of charleston south carolina when i was 9 i have no agenda except to be funny neither i or the writers profess to offer any worldly wisdom in my experience its not just that serious books get a hearing on comedy shows but serious books get a serious hearing as well as a funny one on comedy shows its a bit like school camp shooting a film everyones on heat its a strange energy its full of adrenalin i funnel my excess energy in funny little ways i do a lot of dancing in my trailer i love music heres the funny thing about the response ive been aware of to my dating famous people its been very negative im either not goodlooking enough not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people i like the hotcold the sugarsalt being able to play overthetop and dramatic things  in the same film just as in my life i can be very funny and at other times almost extinguished im an offroad racecar driver and i think every woman in my life has told me thats not a sensible hobby but when i was growing even more than i wanted to be funny i wanted to be a racecar driver thats all i thought about i worked for a race team when i was 15 and i traveled with them kyle bakers work is really funny but its also got a very clear vision its funny ive been very successful and done a lot of films and i dont really have an agent  i dont really pursue jobs i let people come to me if you look at the game and everything its not quite like looking at an animated film because thats total character this this is really movement but its got funny little things if you look for the humor theyre actually getting to the character its a funny thing because you look at the careers of other filmmakers and you see them sort of slow down and you realize maybe this becomes harder to do as you get older thats sort of a cautionary thing i hope it doesnt happen to me theres a darkness under the hangover because ultimately theres a missing person and its not really that funny theres a sort of darkness under it that i love and still people are laughing as hard if not harder than they did in old school i think people like comedies and i think concept driven comedies seem to be working when its a clear concept and you deliver funny stuff now that im more mature in a funny way i can even appreciate that ive bad to become more aware of my body since ive chosen acting as my career i have to keep my weight down anywayive been used to it for years so its no problem and theres nothing i cant do comedy is so subjective you could be in a room with 400 people laughing at a joke and you could just not think its funny youre just sitting there like am i in the twilight zone why is everyone laughing its such a personal thing people have such a personal visceral response to comedy i would do it today because the thing that appealed to me was not necessarily the mechanics of the robot but it was his personality and how funny and charming he was you know if i started worrying about what the critics think id never make another comedy you couldnt pick a less funny group than critics  you couldnt find a more bitter group of people when i was a kid i had this funny blonde hair and everyone called me chick because i looked like tweety bird i think that hangover ii is as funny as the hangover i honest to god but i think that its a little bit darker and the stakes are a little bit higher i dont think know if anythings going to translate anywhere youre making a movie you hope its going to be funny you cant think about how its going to go over if you can find the line between sympathetic and creepy you have reached a very funny area i dont think the public is dying to see me necessarily be funny all the time i love new york i was sad depressed and incredibly moved by our fellow countrymen and what theyve done i wanted to give people a chance to see something funny have a distraction jim carrey a comic genius has a harder time overcoming the publics desire for him to be funny simply because hes so good at it if you take a bunch of superstars and put them in a room where they dont have their assistants and entourage its funny to see what happens because death and illness are the most horrible things in life of course thats where the most absurdly funny things are going to happen i think one of the basic tasks in life  one of the nice things we can do for each other  is to take things that are horrible and scary and make them acceptable and less frightening and if possible funny it feels great to succeed at that i appreciate humor so much but im actually not a funny girl during the great depression when people laughed their worries disappeared audiences loved these funny men i decided to become one i remember interviewing someone i actually felt bad for and therefore didnt want to take an ironic stance against him it actually turned out to be a really funny piece i dont think my judgment is that good i dont know what is funny its funny the hardest thing to do is to make something look like its fast loose and improvised and get somebody to laugh sometimes we have to actually say i think youre really funny but none of your jokes are going to make it on the air so just answer my questions seriously im not a comedian im an actor who just happens to be funny on occasion the prospects for a coherent hilarious and consistent american comedy seem to lessen every year as the poor waterlogged gassy corpse called evan almighty proved when it floated ashore recently so theres a temptation to think too highly of robin williamss uneven but occasionally funny license to wed lucky is for laughs and theres really nothing funny that im doing on dexter i think more than anything both comment on the fact that anybody is capable of anything just because they are the shy guy in the corner doesnt mean that they are a harmless little bunny there have been times when i felt suicidal and i would stop my head from going in that direction of negativity because i thought thered be something id miss that was funny in the future if theres a chance im going to laugh tomorrow then want to live to experience that and remember its also very funny because side by side with grief lies joy i liked getting the best villain award i thought that was funny the music industry is really funny when you have a hit record everyone knows who are you everyone wants to do duets with you then if you have a miss people suffer from amnesia this is funny because i just had a job over the summer for vh1 a project i did called strange frequency where i got to play a goth rock band singer i mean im married first of all to one of if not the most wonderful women in the world she is everything  funny attractive hardworking she has integrity she loves me to bits a film that i love is raising arizona and thats funny but its quite indie and weird and odd and quirky id love to do something like that who knows and of course marc cherry heightens it and makes it hilarious but theres so many universal themes in the show and he made it so funny we knew he was onto something if he could keep it up and thankfully he did its so funny when youre actually directing because things start popping that you dont expect to pop and something that you think is going to pop maybe doesnt quite have the impetus that you thought it might well im not afraid to say something if i think its funny even if its harsh or racist the promos with all of the beautiful women probably attracted some men but the mystery story line is pretty cool its got that dark edge and people will watch anything funny but i think you can make fun of anything as long as its funny enough its funny because 1600 penn was the first time i really started to read the reviews because i am an executive producer and i wanted to see what people were enjoying and not enjoying as a means to an end right i mean i talk about being jewish a lot its funny because i do think of myself as jewish ethnically but im not religious at all i have no religion its funny because the book of mormon is the book of mormon now when i was doing it at the very beginning and i was a part of it for four years and always believed in it i never really knew if it was going to be more than a convention for south park fans i know people will think its funny because ive done glamour modelling in the past but i felt embarrassed about my body and just wanted to cover it up i got the wakeup call that no one is policing our oceans i wondered how can i do anything what really can i do to make things better there are some perks to being a celebrity my job is to be funny once in a while but its my responsibility to make good use of it my parents grandparents aunts and uncles were all funny and i felt that energy that delivery that timing that sarcasm all that stuff seeped into my brain wikipedia is just an incredible thing it is factencirclingly huge and it is idiosyncratic careful messy funny shocking and full of simmering controversies  and it is free and it is fast i dont write literary fiction  i write books that are entertaining but are also i hope wellconstructed and thoughtful and funny and have things to say about men and women and families and children and life in america today do you want me to apologize after every joke if it doesnt offend somebody its probably not a joke its probably an observation thats not funny its gotta offend somebody somewhere billy tauzin is one of the most interesting people in washington he is smart funny and interesting ive actually tried to roast somebody that i dont like and it doesnt go well either theyre a bad sport or im not as funny as i could be my parents are both very funny but theyre also relatively softspoken normal human beings while im just a lunatic i dont know where this loud ballsy hammy ridiculousness came from im just glad i followed my goals and my parents did too its not like we even had a plan when i dragged my mom to los angeles its funny though because when i first started going to races after we met i was extremely nervous its like being backstage and hoping you dont trip over something or break an amp or accidentally speak into a live microphone so i was really hesitant people are funny and in the most tragic situations when comedy erupts from nowhere it can turn on its head within the space of a second or a minute youre laughing one minute and youre crying the next and thats just life for me and that is what people are like so it was just funny to read a script that was just similar to what had been going on in my life when we criticize in iran the actions of the government the fundamentalists say that we and the bush administration are in the same camp the funny thing is that human rights activists and mr bush can never be situated in the same group i have a funny family but none of them are remotely in show business it is funny because the guy who is my boss now howard stern has a similarity there he got big being a regular guy he wasnt the greatest looking guy in the world but i think funny and talent will always win out i mean of course there are hurdles but i think if youre funny you will get over all of that the last person they expected to connect with a screenplay was the comedic blonde actress with the funny voice
