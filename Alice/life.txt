in three words i can sum up everything ive learned about life it goes on do not dwell in the past do not dream of the future concentrate the mind on the present moment throughout life people will make you mad disrespect you and treat you bad let god deal with the things they do cause hate in your heart will consume you too life is a song  sing it life is a game  play it life is a challenge  meet it life is a dream  realize it life is a sacrifice  offer it life is love  enjoy it a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing when i stand before god at the end of my life i would hope that i would not have a single bit of talent left and could say i used everything you gave me never be bullied into silence never allow yourself to be made a victim accept no ones definition of your life define yourself believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact dont go around saying the world owes you a living the world owes you nothing it was here first i still find each day too short for all the thoughts i want to think all the walks i want to take all the books i want to read and all the friends i want to see you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life all life is an experiment the more experiments you make the better life is a dream for the wise a game for the fool a comedy for the rich a tragedy for the poor change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future life is really simple but we insist on making it complicated how far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young compassionate with the aged sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong because someday in your life you will have been all of these the truth is you dont know what is going to happen tomorrow life is a crazy ride and nothing is guaranteed open your eyes look within are you satisfied with the life youre living life is what happens while you are busy making other plans go confidently in the direction of your dreams live the life you have imagined a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them  that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like my formula for living is quite simple i get up in the morning and i go to bed at night in between i occupy myself as best i can only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile i have a simple philosophy fill whats empty empty whats full scratch where it itches any idiot can face a crisis  its day to day living that wears you out the most important thing is to enjoy your life  to be happy  its all that matters we must let go of the life we have planned so as to accept the one that is waiting for us lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day change your life today dont gamble on the future act now without delay every man dies not every man really lives i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived if you love life dont waste time for time is what life is made up of a man sooner or later discovers that he is the mastergardener of his soul the director of his life all the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on good friends good books and a sleepy conscience this is the ideal life our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts we need to give each other the space to grow to be ourselves to exercise our diversity we need to give each other space so that we may both give and receive such beautiful things as ideas openness dignity joy healing and inclusion he who has a why to live can bear almost any how a baby is gods opinion that life should go on to live a pure unselfish life one must count nothing as ones own in the midst of abundance remember when lifes path is steep to keep your mind even life is like dancing if we have a big floor many people will dance some will get angry when the rhythm changes but life is changing all the time when we remember we are all mad the mysteries disappear and life stands explained life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood we must be willing to let go of the life we have planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us the price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it dont go through life grow through life life is 10 percent what you make it and 90 percent how you take it the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are it is not length of life but depth of life every creature is better alive than dead men and moose and pine trees and he who understands it aright will rather preserve its life than destroy it dont let life discourage you everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was here is the test to find whether your mission on earth is finished if youre alive it isnt i slept and dreamt that life was joy i awoke and saw that life was service i acted and behold service was joy a person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body  the wishbone there are three constants in life change choice and principles its all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced my life is my message the true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life i love those who yearn for the impossible i love life because what more is there i dont believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well life loves the liver of it nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less once you say youre going to settle for second thats what happens to you in life life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about the courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy i do not regret one moment of my life our life is what our thoughts make it beware the barrenness of a busy life the shoe that fits one person pinches another there is no recipe for living that suits all cases everything has been figured out except how to live the only disability in life is a bad attitude if life were predictable it would cease to be life and be without flavor who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies when life is too easy for us we must beware or we may not be ready to meet the blows which sooner or later come to everyone rich or poor i think ive discovered the secret of life  you just hang around until you get used to it what we think determines what happens to us so if we want to change our lives we need to stretch our minds doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life everything in life is luck use your health even to the point of wearing it out that is what it is for spend all you have before you die do not outlive yourself life is a series of collisions with the future it is not the sum of what we have been but what we yearn to be with the past i have nothing to do nor with the future i live now the story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye the story of love is hello goodbye most people have never learned that one of the main aims in life is to enjoy it the aim of life is to live and to live means to be aware joyously drunkenly serenely divinely aware life consists in what a man is thinking of all day not life but good life is to be chiefly valued life becomes harder for us when we live for others but it also becomes richer and happier a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives i have found that if you love life life will love you back may you live all the days of your life a healthful hunger for a great idea is the beauty and blessedness of life life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh to affect the quality of the day that is the highest of arts life is a tragedy when seen in closeup but a comedy in longshot the art of living is more like wrestling than dancing begin at once to live and count each separate day as a separate life look i dont want to wax philosophic but i will say that if youre alive youve got to flap your arms and legs youve got to jump around a lot for life is the very opposite of death and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully or youre not alive when i hear somebody sigh life is hard i am always tempted to ask compared to what people living deeply have no fear of death a wellspent day brings happy sleep fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts life itself still remains a very effective therapist life in abundance comes only through great love the greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes what is important in life is life and not the result of life you have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need an aim in life is the only fortune worth finding i look back on my life like a good days work it was done and i am satisfied with it while theres life theres hope get correct views of life and learn to see the world in its true light it will enable you to live pleasantly to do good and when summoned away to leave without regret life is a long lesson in humility life is half spent before we know what it is life must be lived as play maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets there is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner that in the dinner the sweets come last one way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure kindness ive discovered is everything in life unbeing dead isnt being alive to change ones life start immediately do it flamboyantly life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs this life is worth living we can say since it is what we make it life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome the purpose of life is a life of purpose we are all here for a spell get all the good laughs you can the greatest pleasure of life is love the great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it our business in life is not to succeed but to continue to fail in good spirits the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge while we are postponing life speeds by there is just one life for each of us our own the basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy but that it is a bore it is not so much a war as an endless standing in line a chain is no stronger than its weakest link and life is after all a chain life is never easy for those who dream life is too short to work so hard the chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions we are here to add what we can to life not to get what we can from life for the happiest life days should be rigorously planned nights left open to chance life well spent is long if you live long enough youll make mistakes but if you learn from them youll be a better person its how you handle adversity not how it affects you the main thing is never quit never quit never quit life is something to do when you cant get to sleep life isnt a matter of milestones but of moments we cant plan life all we can do is be available for it life will always be to a large extent what we ourselves make it life is wasted on the living life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself the art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much the most exhausting thing in life is being insincere the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death life is a succession of moments to live each one is to succeed there is no wealth but life life is largely a matter of expectation give me the luxuries of life and i will willingly do without the necessities the indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this decide what you want i take a simple view of life it is keep your eyes open and get on with it seventy percent of success in life is showing up life is not an exact science it is an art every man regards his own life as the new years eve of time to live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else what a wonderful life ive had i only wish id realized it sooner life is like a trumpet  if you dont put anything into it you dont get anything out of it i take care of my flowers and my cats and enjoy food and thats living no man is a failure who is enjoying life the man who has no innerlife is a slave to his surroundings wrong life cannot be lived rightly life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises life is anything that dies when you stomp on it my life is every moment of my life it is not a culmination of the past life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act to me if life boils down to one thing its movement to live is to keep moving i did not direct my life i didnt design it i never made decisions things always came up and made them for me thats what life is human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning to live is to change and to be perfect is to have changed often our entire life  consists ultimately in accepting ourselves as we are to know nothing is the happiest life to be free is to have achieved your life varietys the very spice of life that gives it all its flavor you dont have to be the dalai lama to tell people that lifes about change life is but thought life itself is the proper binge the whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work  that goes on it adds up life is a culmination of the past an awareness of the present an indication of a future beyond knowledge the quality that gives a touch of divinity to matter the less routine the more life life is much shorter than i imagined it to be life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul the indian summer of life should be a little sunny and a little sad like the season and infinite in wealth and depth of tone but never hustled any life is made up of a single moment the moment in which a man finds out once and for all who he is what we play is life life is a great sunrise i do not see why death should not be an even greater one life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious the fear of life is the favorite disease of the 20th century life has a higher end than to be amused the person lives twice who lives the first life well unrest of spirit is a mark of life life itself still remains a very effective therapist life is a lot like jazz its best when you improvise i have inspiration and feelings of being alive most every day i live i had no blood relatives till i made some keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead i believe that if life gives you lemons you should make lemonade and try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka and have a party where there is love there is life life is one big road with lots of signs so when you riding through the ruts dont complicate your mind flee from hate mischief and jealousy dont bury your thoughts put your vision to reality wake up and live ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career ive lost almost 300 games 26 times ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed if you dont design your own life plan chances are youll fall into someone elses plan and guess what they have planned for you not much thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle and the life of the candle will not be shortened happiness never decreases by being shared i hated every minute of training but i said dont quit suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion in everyones life at some time our inner fire goes out it is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being we should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit you have enemies good that means youve stood up for something sometime in your life do not take life too seriously you will never get out of it alive take up one idea make that one idea your life  think of it dream of it live on that idea let the brain muscles nerves every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone this is the way to success our prime purpose in this life is to help others and if you cant help them at least dont hurt them your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma  which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition in the end its not the years in your life that count its the life in your years choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how youre going to live your life ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed clouds come floating into my life no longer to carry rain or usher storm but to add color to my sunset sky life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards my mother was the most beautiful woman i ever saw all i am i owe to my mother i attribute all my success in life to the moral intellectual and physical education i received from her character develops itself in the stream of life for the past 33 years i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something i would rather live my life as if there is a god and die to find out there isnt than live my life as if there isnt and die to find out there is but friendship is precious not only in the shade but in the sunshine of life and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it i like nonsense it wakes up the brain cells fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living its a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope which is what i do and that enables you to laugh at lifes realities every moment and every event of every mans life on earth plants something in his soul lifes most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others imagine all the people living life in peace you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world will be as one life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing whatever your lifes work is do it well a man should do his job so well that the living the dead and the unborn could do it no better too often we underestimate the power of a touch a smile a kind word a listening ear an honest compliment or the smallest act of caring all of which have the potential to turn a life around your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of lifes longing for itself they came through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness it is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity all changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another all life demands struggle those who have everything given to them become lazy selfish and insensitive to the real values of life the very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today if you can dream it then you can achieve it you will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size government programs once launched never disappear actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life well ever see on this earth i cannot even imagine where i would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy lets face it friends make life a lot more fun to be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life foolish people are idle wise people are diligent imagination is everything it is the preview of lifes coming attractions im not going to change the way i look or the way i feel to conform to anything ive always been a freak so ive been a freak all my life and i have to live with that you know im one of those people god gave us the gift of life it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well just as a candle cannot burn without fire men cannot live without a spiritual life success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another learn to enjoy every minute of your life be happy now dont wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future think how really precious is the time you have to spend whether its at work or with your family every minute should be enjoyed and savored if you always put limit on everything you do physical or anything else it will spread into your work and into your life there are no limits there are only plateaus and you must not stay there you must go beyond them gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend bad things do happen how i respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life i can choose to sit in perpetual sadness immobilized by the gravity of my loss or i can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift i have  life itself the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat music is a moral law it gives soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and charm and gaiety to life and to everything again you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something  your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty anyone who keeps learning stays young the greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young when you rise in the morning give thanks for the light for your life for your strength give thanks for your food and for the joy of living if you see no reason to give thanks the fault lies in yourself we love life not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving the quality not the longevity of ones life is what is important without music life would be a mistake i believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone best both for the body and the mind people fear death even more than pain its strange that they fear death life hurts a lot more than death at the point of death the pain is over yeah i guess it is a friend just as treasures are uncovered from the earth so virtue appears from good deeds and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind to walk safely through the maze of human life one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits i remember my mothers prayers and they have always followed me they have clung to me all my life ive learned that you shouldnt go through life with a catchers mitt on both hands you need to be able to throw something back of lifes two chief prizes beauty and truth i found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborers hand you cant stop loving or wanting to love because when its right its the best thing in the world when youre in a relationship and its good even if nothing else in your life is right you feel like your whole world is complete the monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people i love being married its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life property is intended to serve life and no matter how much we surround it with rights and respect it has no personal being it is part of the earth man walks on it is not man its the game of life do i win or do i lose one day theyre gonna shut the game down i gotta have as much fun and go around the board as many times as i can before its my turn to leave love is life and if you miss love you miss life the best thing to hold onto in life is each other there is nothing more tragic than to find an individual bogged down in the length of life devoid of breadth the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time we make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give the only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows today more than ever before life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility not only nation to nation and human to human but also human to other forms of life without health life is not life it is only a state of langour and suffering  an image of death he who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life when i was young i thought that money was the most important thing in life now that i am old i know that it is beginning today treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight extend to them all the care kindness and understanding you can muster and do it with no thought of any reward your life will never be the same again the more you praise and celebrate your life the more there is in life to celebrate in dwelling live close to the ground in thinking keep to the simple in conflict be fair and generous in governing dont try to control in work do what you enjoy in family life be completely present if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with success unexpected in common hours learning to trust is one of lifes most difficult tasks achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life and that happiness not pain or mindless selfindulgence is the proof of your moral integrity since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values the things that will destroy america are prosperityatanyprice peaceatanyprice safetyfirst instead of dutyfirst the love of soft living and the getrichquick theory of life trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement dont make assumptions find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings sadness and drama with just this one agreement you can completely transform your life life is tough but its tougher when youre stupid a man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life lifes tragedy is that we get old to soon and wise too late focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something  your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life all the adversity ive had in my life all my troubles and obstacles have strengthened me you may not realize it when it happens but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you all my life i have tried to pluck a thistle and plant a flower wherever the flower would grow in thought and mind we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light an armed society is a polite society manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life i love sleep my life has the tendency to fall apart when im awake you know the best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own you do not blame them on your mother the ecology or the president you realize that you control your own destiny tomorrow is the most important thing in life comes into us at midnight very clean its perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands it hopes weve learned something from yesterday remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything  all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure  these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life so long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart i shall say that life is good today i choose life every morning when i wake up i can choose joy happiness negativity pain to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices  today i choose to feel life not to deny my humanity but embrace it to succeed in life you need two things ignorance and confidence you can have everything in life you want if you will just help other people get what they want life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit my life has been one great big joke a dance thats walked a song thats spoke i laugh so hard i almost choke when i think about myself your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it there is only one thing in life worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about through humor you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers and once you find laughter no matter how painful your situation might be you can survive it the secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you if you do that youre in control of your life if you dont life controls you all my life my heart has yearned for a thing i cannot name if the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you it will be enough there are only two tragedies in life one is not getting what one wants and the other is getting it the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves what a wee little part of a persons life are his acts and his words his real life is led in his head and is known to none but himself those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them for these only gave them life those the art of living well life is full of beauty notice it notice the bumble bee the small child and the smiling faces smell the rain and feel the wind live your life to the fullest potential and fight for your dreams the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts therefore guard accordingly and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature in our daily life we encounter people who are angry deceitful intent only on satisfying their own needs there is so much anger distrust greed and pettiness that we are losing our capacity to work well together to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love god better because of them make it a habit to tell people thank you to express your appreciation sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return truly appreciate those around you and youll soon find many others around you truly appreciate life and youll find that you have more of it each person must live their life as a model for others i believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life you cant truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles true wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life ourselves and the world around us there are four questions of value in life what is sacred of what is the spirit made what is worth living for and what is worth dying for the answer to each is the same only love money isnt the most important thing in life but its reasonably close to oxygen on the gotta have it scale im the one that has to die when its time for me to die so let me live my life the way i want to i decided very early on just to accept life unconditionally i never expected it to do anything special for me yet i seemed to accomplish far more than i had ever hoped most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it life is a gamble you can get hurt but people die in plane crashes lose their arms and legs in car accidents people die every day same with fighters some die some get hurt some go on you just dont let yourself believe it will happen to you i dont believe in guilt i believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person and dont judge people in your life i think you should live completely free you change your life by changing your heart probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age when the eager passions of youth are cooled and the infirmities of age not yet begun as we see that the shadows which are at morning and evening so large almost entirely disappear at midday i never thought of losing but now that it s happened the only thing is to do it right thats my obligation to all the people who believe in me we all have to take defeats in life life stands before me like an eternal spring with new and brilliant clothes life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself true friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils strive to have friends for life without friends is like life on a desert island to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune to keep him is a blessing the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only object of good government the key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering my rule of life prescribed as an absolutely sacred rite smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before after and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them even when a person has all of lifes comforts  good food good shelter a companion  he or she can still become unhappy when encountering a tragic situation march on do not tarry to go forward is to move toward perfection march on and fear not the thorns or the sharp stones on lifes path you can never really live anyone elses life not even your childs the influence you exert is through your own life and what youve become yourself the purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls the important thing is that men should have a purpose in life it should be something useful something good as you walk down the fairway of life you must smell the roses for you only get to play one round every mans life ends the same way it is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another if you ask me what i came into this life to do i will tell you i came to live out loud part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside theres no tragedy in life like the death of a child things never get back to the way they were some of the worst mistakes of my life have been haircuts before success comes in any mans life hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and perhaps some failures when defeat overtakes a man the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit thats exactly what the majority of men do you can change your world by changing your words remember death and life are in the power of the tongue have the courage to say no have the courage to face the truth do the right thing because it is right these are the magic keys to living your life with integrity life is as tedious as twicetold tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man a sense of humor is needed armor joy in ones heart and some laughter on ones lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing there is no end to education it is not that you read a book pass an examination and finish with education the whole of life from the moment you are born to the moment you die is a process of learning nothing is perfect life is messy relationships are complex outcomes are uncertain people are irrational a nation which has forgotten the quality of courage which in the past has been brought to public life is not as likely to insist upon or regard that quality in its chosen leaders today  and in fact we have forgotten life is not easy for any of us but what of that we must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves we must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained there is no passion to be found playing small  in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living literature adds to reality it does not simply describe it it enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides and in this respect it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become if you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life in the course of my life i have often had to eat my words and i must confess that i have always found it a wholesome diet once i knew only darkness and stillness my life was without past or future but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness and my heart leaped to the rapture of living i am convinced that material things can contribute a lot to making ones life pleasant but basically if you do not have very good friends and relatives who matter to you life will be really empty and sad and material things cease to be important nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result football is like life  it requires perseverance selfdenial hard work sacrifice dedication and respect for authority for time and the world do not stand still change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future life is either a great adventure or nothing stop acting as if life is a rehearsal live this day as if it were your last the past is over and gone the future is not guaranteed once in his life every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead time is the coin of your life it is the only coin you have and only you can determine how it will be spent be careful lest you let other people spend it for you in war as in life it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed to take up the best alternative open and if so it is folly not to work for it with all your might books constitute capital a library book lasts as long as a house for hundreds of years it is not then an article of mere consumption but fairly of capital and often in the case of professional men setting out in life it is their only capital the christian life is not a constant high i have my moments of deep discouragement i have to go to god in prayer with tears in my eyes and say o god forgive me or help me the ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival i guess i have always been deeply terrified to really be someones wife since i know from life one cannot love another ever really life is never fair and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not people grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously this is how character is built without pain there would be no suffering without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes to make it right pain and suffering is the key to all windows without it there is no way of life if you are not too long i will wait here for you all my life constant development is the law of life and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position life is hard its harder if youre stupid let everyone try and find that as a result of daily prayer he adds something new to his life something with which nothing can be compared no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it is lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new it takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure to embrace the new but there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful there is more security in the adventurous and exciting for in movement there is life and in change there is power truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness holding on to anger resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life life is a process of becoming a combination of states we have to go through where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it this is a kind of death life is a series of experiences each one of which makes us bigger even though sometimes it is hard to realize this for the world was built to develop character and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward there is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it life is one grand sweet song so start the music when we do the best that we can we never know what miracle is wrought in our life or in the life of another at fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender in its place was as honorable as resistance especially if one had no choice one of the things i learned the hard way was that it doesnt pay to get discouraged keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself as you simplify your life the laws of the universe will be simpler solitude will not be solitude poverty will not be poverty nor weakness weakness life loves to be taken by the lapel and told im with you kid lets go there are only three things women need in life food water and compliments life is an exciting business and most exciting when it is lived for others im not claiming divinity ive never claimed purity of soul ive never claimed to have the answers to life i only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as i can but i still believe in peace love and understanding a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things there will be sleeping enough in the grave each player must accept the cards life deals him or her but once they are in hand he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game we have one life it soon will be past what we do for god is all that will last life is hard after all it kills you my philosophy of life is that if we make up our mind what we are going to make of our lives then work hard toward that goal we never lose  somehow we win out my favorite things in life dont cost any money its really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time a chief event of life is the day in which we have encountered a mind that startled us to deprive a man of his natural liberty and to deny to him the ordinary amenities of life is worse then starving the body it is starvation of the soul the dweller in the body it was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped my family frankly they werent folks who went to church every week my mother was one of the most spiritual people i knew but she didnt raise me in the church so i came to my christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of jesus christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that i would want to lead learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself and know that everything in life has purpose there are no mistakes no coincidences all events are blessings given to us to learn from one reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus we never concentrate our power most people dabble their way through life never deciding to master anything in particular the main purpose of life is to live rightly think rightly act rightly the soul must languish when we give all our thought to the body at the end of your life you will never regret not having passed one more test not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal you will regret time not spent with a husband a friend a child or a parent life imitates art far more than art imitates life say theres a white kid who lives in a nice home goes to an allwhite school and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter  for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me because what thats saying is that hes living a fantasy life of rebellion i have spent many years of my life in opposition and i rather like the role freedom is never dear at any price it is the breath of life what would a man not pay for living life every man holds dear but the dear man holds honor far more precious dear than life alcohol is the anesthesia by which we endure the operation of life we have the duty to protect the life of an unborn child the greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intendedand not to take a hint when a hint isnt intended you will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love religion is more than life remember that his own religion is the truest to every man even if it stands low in the scales of philosophical comparison very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking the great danger for family life in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure comfort and independence lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish there is more to life than increasing its speed fathers should be neither seen nor heard that is the only proper basis for family life the world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happily married life i put all my genius into my life i put only my talent into my works there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain one should sympathise with the colour the beauty the joy of life the less said about lifes sores the better i know in my heart that man is good that what is right will always eventually triumph and theres purpose and worth to each and every life purity of personal life is the one indispensable condition for building up a sound education but what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads the man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life the one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties you do things when the opportunities come along ive had periods in my life when ive had a bundle of ideas come along and ive had long dry spells if i get an idea next week ill do something if not i wont do a damn thing presents dont really mean much to me i dont want to sound mawkish but  it was the realization that i have a great many people in my life who really love me and who i really love im so glad i never feel important it does complicate life ones real life is so often the life that one does not lead education is not preparation for life education is life itself life must be lived and curiosity kept alive one must never for whatever reason turn his back on life i bear a charmed life man does not control his own fate the women in his life do that for him i havent trusted polls since i read that 62 of women had affairs during their lunch hour ive never met a woman in my life who would give up lunch for sex in married life three is company and two none life is pretty simple you do some stuff most fails some works you do more of what works if it works big others quickly copy it then you do something else the trick is the doing something else throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country a man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life autobiographies are only useful as the lives you read about and analyze may suggest to you something that you may find useful in your own journey through life in modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude it makes the whole world kin the greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes thats the day we truly grow up for life and death are one even as the river and the sea are one it is one of the beautiful compensations in this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself in poverty and other misfortunes of life true friends are a sure refuge the young they keep out of mischief to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds i am a woman in process im just trying like everybody else i try to take every conflict every experience and learn from it life is never dull when you have nobody you can make a cup of tea for when nobody needs you thats when i think life is over if you are lucky enough to have lived in paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you for paris is a moveable feast dost thou love life then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of your daily life is your temple and your religion when you enter into it take with you your all you have to take risks we will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen frazier is so ugly that he should donate his face to the us bureau of wild life if anyone is crazy enough to want to kill a president of the united states he can do it all he must be prepared to do is give his life for the presidents he who is not everyday conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life the greatest gift of life is friendship and i have received it life is without meaning you bring the meaning to it the meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be being alive is the meaning the world is very different now for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life life is hard then you die then they throw dirt in your face then the worms eat you be grateful it happens in that order opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging i am sorry to say that there is too much point to the wisecrack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins there is always inequality in life some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country life is unfair i really havent had that exciting of a life there are a lot of things i wish i would have done instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life so i pretty much like to make it up id rather tell a story about somebody else choose your lifes mate carefully from this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up success comes from taking the initiative and following up persisting eloquently expressing the depth of your love what simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life i want to live my life so that my nights are not full of regrets dont be too timid and squeamish about your actions all life is an experiment this is the strangest life ive ever known the wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently but he is willing in great crises to give even his life  knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine your life is the fruit of your own doing you have no one to blame but yourself is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death life is thickly sown with thorns and i know no other remedy than to pass quickly through them the longer we dwell on our misfortunes the greater is their power to harm us i have learned that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours when his life was ruined his family killed his farm destroyed job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens why god why me and the thundering voice of god answered theres just something about you that pisses me off all the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination imagination is the workshop of your mind capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth the quality of a persons life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence regardless of their chosen field of endeavor are you bored with life then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart live for it die for it and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours old age is just a record of ones whole life the more sand has escaped from the hourglass of our life the clearer we should see through it death and life have their determined appointments riches and honors depend upon heaven a man is a god in ruins when men are innocent life shall be longer and shall pass into the immortal as gently as we awake from dreams to be able to look back upon ones life in satisfaction is to live twice an atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church an atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said an atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death he wants disease conquered poverty vanished war eliminated you want to believe that theres one relationship in life thats beyond betrayal a relationship thats beyond that kind of hurt and there isnt i need drama in my life to keep making music i should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end requesting only the advantage authors have of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first one thing they never tell you about child raising is that for the rest of your life at the drop of a hat you are expected to know your childs name and how old he or she is there are two primary choices in life to accept conditions as they exist or accept the responsibility for changing them the ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace making the best of circumstances friendship is the shadow of the evening which increases with the setting sun of life to lengthen thy life lessen thy meals three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for life without liberty is like a body without spirit you may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the worlds problems at once but dont ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for the small ones and when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task go to sleep in peace the secret of life is honesty and fair dealing if you can fake that youve got it made be true to the game because the game will be true to you if you try to shortcut the game then the game will shortcut you if you put forth the effort good things will be bestowed upon you thats truly about the game and in some ways thats about life too life and death are one thread the same line viewed from different sides if we dont know life how can we know death do not be too moral you may cheat yourself out of much life so aim above morality be not simply good be good for something he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act the object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane the energy of the mind is the essence of life i challenge you to make your life a masterpiece i challenge you to join the ranks of those people who live what they teach who walk their talk the expectations of life depend upon diligence the mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools life is a gift and it offers us the privilege opportunity and responsibility to give something back by becoming more life is the art of drawing without an eraser politicians also have no leisure because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself power and glory or happiness children are the anchors of a mothers life freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose anything less is a form of slavery a life is either all spiritual or not spiritual at all no man can serve two masters your life is shaped by the end you live for you are made in the image of what you desire is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves as soon as there is life there is danger it is best to rise from life as from a banquet neither thirsty nor drunken babies dont need a vacation but i still see them at the beach it pisses me off ill go over to a little baby and say what are you doing here you havent worked a day in your life life is not fair get used to it the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom it is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life where you stumble there lies your treasure one secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes people disparage knowing and the intellectual life and urge doing i am content with knowing if only i could know waste your money and youre only out of money but waste your time and youve lost a part of your life if theres not drama and negativity in my life all my songs will be really wack and boring or something art is the proper task of life different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government the unexamined life is not worth living sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick dont lose faith each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death i cant really change my life to accommodate people who are jealous i dont see why i should there is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself as we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed i know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor men create gods after their own image not only with regard to their form but with regard to their mode of life the true object of all human life is play earth is a task garden heaven is a playground our truest life is when we are in dreams awake life began with waking up and loving my mothers face i want to wake up every day and do whatever comes in my mind and not feel pressure or obligations to do anything else in my life a womans life can really be a succession of lives each revolving around some emotionally compelling situation or challenge and each marked off by some intense experience a broad margin of leisure is as beautiful in a mans life as in a book haste makes waste no less in life than in housekeeping keep the time observe the hours of the universe not of the cars i think computer viruses should count as life i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive weve created life in our own image thou wilt find rest from vain fancies if thou doest every act in life as though it were thy last id like to be settled into somewhat of a normal life somewhat i know its never going to be completely normal ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness so on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another only a look and a voice then darkness again and a silence the most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity the fears are paper tigers you can do anything you decide to do you can act to change and control your life and the procedure  the process is its own reward loneliness is my least favorite thing about life the thing that im most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me in college i never realized the opportunities available to a pro athlete ive been given the chance to meet all kinds of people to travel and expand my financial capabilities to get ideas and learn about life to create a world apart from basketball life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage the state comes into existence for the sake of life and continues to exist for the sake of good life life is truly known only to those who suffer lose endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat there are two tragedies in life one is to lose your hearts desire the other is to gain it dreams are necessary to life there are old heads in the world who cannot help me by their example or advice to live worthily and satisfactorily to myself but i believe that it is in my power to elevate myself this very hour above the common level of my life i have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed its true christmas can feel like a lot of work particularly for mothers but when you look back on all the christmases in your life youll find youve created family traditions and lasting memories those memories good and bad are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul a man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food therefore if he eats meat he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite we can always choose to perceive things differently you can focus on whats wrong in your life or you can focus on whats right to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already three parts dead you must understand the whole of life not just one little part of it that is why you must read that is why you must look at the skies that is why you must sing and dance and write poems and suffer and understand for all that is life when i chased after money i never had enough when i got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life then i was prosperous our life is frittered away by detail simplify simplify sometimes i feel my whole life has been one big rejection respect is one of lifes greatest treasures i mean what does it all add up to if you dont have that if you spend your life competing with business men what do you have a bank account and ulcers if there is only one thing in my life that i am proud of its that ive never been a kept woman sometimes i think it would be easier to avoid old age to die young but then youd never complete your life would you youd never wholly know you thug life to me is dead there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats a hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself i have so much chaos in my life its become normal you become used to it you have to just relax calm down take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how theyre wrong for me life is continuously being hungry the meaning of life is not simply to exist to survive but to move ahead to go up to achieve to conquer always fall in with what youre asked to accept take what is given and make it over your way my aim in life has always been to hold my own with whatevers going not against with i dont have expectations expectations in your life just lead to giant disappointments judgments value judgments concerning life for or against can in the last resort never be true they possess value only as symptoms they come into consideration only as symptoms  in themselves such judgments are stupidities if youre married and you have a wife and you really love your wife is it good enough to only say to your wife i love her the day you get married or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity and thats how i feel about my relationship with jesus christ is that it is the most important thing in my life let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life the living being is only a species of the dead and a very rare species life is divided into three terms  that which was which is and which will be let us learn from the past to profit by the present and from the present to live better in the future there are people who want to make mens lives more difficult for no other reason than the chance it provides them afterwards to offer their prescription for alleviating life their christianity for instance my definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain  and because of your lifestyle have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain this is as true in everyday life as it is in battle we are given one life and the decision is ours whether to wait for circumstances to make up our mind or whether to act and in acting to live most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil that sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life  all areas of life the really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity a dream is your creative vision for your life in the future you must break out of your current comfort zone and become comfortable with the unfamiliar and the unknown the lie is a condition of life the goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe to match your nature with nature if you plan on being anything less than you are capable of being you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life dont ignore the past but deal with it on your own pace once you deal with it you are free of it and you are free to embrace your life and be a happy loving person because if you dont the past will come back to haunt and keep coming back to haunt you what is called genius is the abundance of life and health little men with little minds and little imaginations go through life in little ruts smugly resisting all changes which would jar their little worlds regarding life the wisest men of all ages have judged alike it is worthless being in control of your life and having realistic expectations about your daytoday challenges are the keys to stress management which is perhaps the most important ingredient to living a happy healthy and rewarding life acceptance of ones life has nothing to do with resignation it does not mean running away from the struggle on the contrary it means accepting it as it comes with all the handicaps of heredity of suffering of psychological complexes and injustices bottom line is i didnt return to apple to make a fortune ive been very lucky in my life and already have one when i was 25 my net worth was 100 million or so i decided then that i wasnt going to let it ruin my life theres no way you could ever spend it all and i dont view wealth as something that validates my intelligence the greatest mistake you can make in life is continually fearing that youll make one a return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man his good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example the life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living i just dont know how to deal with so many people giving me that much affection i never had that in my life the key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life  mental emotional spiritual as well as physical about all you can do in life is be who you are some people will love you for you most will love you for what you can do for them and some wont like you at all wealth is the ability to fully experience life every day is a new opportunity you can build on yesterdays success or put its failures behind and start over again thats the way life is with a new game every day and thats the way baseball is if you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant personal liberty is the purpose of government to protect liberty  not to run your personal life not to run the economy and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live what each must seek in his life never was on land or sea it is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else faith is a living daring confidence in gods grace so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times you cannot tailormake the situations in life but you can tailormake the attitudes to fit those situations the only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first loneliness adds beauty to life it puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better ive reached a point in my life where its the little things that matter i was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had i changed my attitude but when you think about it i got pretty far without changing attitudes im happier with that dad almost died of a heart attack in the middle of making apocalypse now the biggest movie of his life it doesnt make you want to jump into that business im not one of those complicated mixedup cats im not looking for the secret to life i just go on from day to day taking what comes education doesnt change life much it just lifts trouble to a higher plane of regard only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience lifes deepest joy true fulfillment apply yourself both now and in the next life without effort you cannot be prosperous though the land be good you cannot have an abundant crop without cultivation false friendship like the ivy decays and ruins the walls it embraces but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports develop an interest in life as you see it the people things literature music  the world is so rich simply throbbing with rich treasures beautiful souls and interesting people forget yourself i always like to look on the optimistic side of life but i am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment therein he cannot be replaced nor can his life be repeated thus everyones task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it never separate the life you live from the words you speak it is not doing the thing we like to do but liking the thing we have to do that makes life blessed using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get but if you work really hard and youre kind amazing things will happen if i knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for my life i have a great respect for incremental improvement and ive done that sort of thing in my life but ive always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes i dont know why because theyre harder theyre much more stressful emotionally and you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that youve completely failed i would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life a man who had good friends fine family  and i dont think i could ask for anything more than that actually most of the change we think we see in life is due to truths being in and out of favor being yourself is one of the hardest things because its scary you always wonder whether youll be accepted for who you really are i decided to call my record inside out because thats my motto about life i dont think you ever succeed at trying to be anyone else but who you truly are there is no more fatal blunderer than he who consumes the greater part of his life getting his living nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions who shall say what prospect life offers to another when i am able to resist the temptation to judge others i can see them as teachers of forgiveness in my life reminding me that i can only have peace of mind when i forgive rather than judge im back to doing everything i used to loving life as ever you leave old habits behind by starting out with the thought i release the need for this in my life the way you think the way you behave the way you eat can influence your life by 30 to 50 years the quality of life is more important than life itself i didnt see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life i think its important to have closure in any relationship that ends  from a romantic relationship to a friendship you should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended you need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase where is the life we have lost in living where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge where is the knowledge we have lost in information im most proud of the blessings that god has bestowed upon me in my life hes given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down but you can still get back up hopefully ill learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing i do two such as you with such a master speed cannot be parted nor be swept away from one another once you are agreed that life is only life forevermore together wing to wing and oar to oar be happy for this moment this moment is your life you have the right to kill me but you dont have the right to judge me thats life theres nobility in that theres focus its genuine its crystal and its pure and its available to everybody so just shut your traps and put down your mcdonalds your vaccines your us weekly your tmz and the rest of it i would say my greatest achievement in life right now  my greatest achievement period is  and im still trying to achieve it  is to be a wonderful father to my kids infuse your life with action dont wait for it to happen make it happen make your own future make your own hope make your own love and whatever your beliefs honor your creator not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high but by doing what you can to make grace happen yourself right now right down here on earth life begins at the end of your comfort zone people are taken aback by a confident pretty girl who knows what she wants in life and isnt going to let anyone get in her way and you know what its all about jealousy what i learned in jail is that i cant change i cant live a different lifestylethis is it this is the life that they gave and this is the life that i made let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others once youve wrestled everything else in life is easy the chief reason for going to school is to get the impression fixed for life that there is a book side for everything death is not an event in life we do not live to experience death if we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present when you are tough on yourself life is going to be infinitely easier on you take care to sell your horse before he dies the art of life is passing losses on the biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams if you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account its funny how most people love the dead once youre dead your made for life mans real life is happy chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so its better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life winning is great sure but if you are really going to do something in life the secret is learning how to lose nobody goes undefeated all the time if you can pick up after a crushing defeat and go on to win again you are going to be a champion someday live your life do your work then take your hat and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond that you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them live the life youve dreamed if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life i think that there is nothing not even crime more opposed to poetry to philosophy ay to life itself than this incessant business choose your friends with caution plan your future with purpose and frame your life with faith there is always a present and extant life be it better or worse which all combine to uphold a man cannot be said to succeed in this life who does not satisfy one friend accept responsibility for your life know that it is you who will get you where you want to go no one else unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives mans life is independent he is born not for the development of the society alone but for the development of his self poetry is a way of taking life by the throat the great advantage of a hotel is that it is a refuge from home life life contains but two tragedies one is not to get your hearts desire the other is to get it one life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it but to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief that is a fate more terrible than dying the major value in life is not what you get the major value in life is what you become its a funny thing about life if you refuse to accept anything but the best you very often get it life is the flower for which love is the honey my advice to people today is as follows if you take the game of life seriously if you take your nervous system seriously if you take your sense organs seriously if you take the energy process seriously you must turn on tune in and drop out miracles in the sense of phenomena we cannot explain surround us on every hand life itself is the miracle of miracles keep your eyes open to your mercies the man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life if i had to live my life again id make the same mistakes only sooner the end of life is to be like god and the soul following god will be like him lifes like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending the struggle of my life created empathy  i could relate to pain being abandoned having people not love me while we have the gift of life it seems to me the only tragedy is to allow part of us to die  whether it is our spirit our creativity or our glorious uniqueness i want to be thoroughly used up when i die for the harder i work the more i live i rejoice in life for its own sake becoming a father i think it inevitably changes your perspective of life i dont get nearly enough sleep and the simplest things in life are completely satisfying i find you dont have to do as much like you dont go on as many outings god is to be worshipped as the one beloved dearer than everything in this and next life three passions simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life the longing for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind the figure a poem makes it begins in delight and ends in wisdom in a clarification of life  not necessarily a great clarification such as sects and cults are founded on but in a momentary stay against confusion one of the secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death all my life affection has been showered upon me and every forward step i have made has been taken in spite of it theres only two people in your life you should lie to the police and your girlfriend one way or another we all have to find what best fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life and dedicate ourselves to that the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us life is to be lived if you have to support yourself you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting and you dont do that by sitting around no man is worth his salt who is not ready at all times to risk his wellbeing to risk his body to risk his life in a great cause i am an example of what is possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by people around them i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life who taught me about quiet strength and dignity never permit a dichotomy to rule your life a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time above our life we love a steadfast friend children make your life important life is not what its supposed to be its what it is the way you cope with it is what makes the difference one of the sanest surest and most generous joys of life comes from being happy over the good fortune of others god had brought me to my knees and made me acknowledge my own nothingness and out of that knowledge i had been reborn i was no longer the centre of my life and therefore i could see god in everything do every act of your life as if it were your last my mother wanted us to understand that the tragedies of your life one day have the potential to be comic stories the next home life is no more natural to us than a cage is natural to a cockatoo music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us oh be swift to love make haste to be kind when you step on the brakes your life is in your foots hands life levels all men death reveals the eminent i am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the american way of life is freedom limited government and minding our own business overseas you are a product of your environment so choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective analyze your life in terms of its environment are the things around you helping you toward success  or are they holding you back im not an example for how people should live their lives never in my life would i ever set out to be an example for people on how to live their lives if you need an example for how to live then you just shouldnt have been born straight up without work all life goes rotten but when work is soulless life stifles and dies i worked hard all my life as far as this music business i dreamed of the day when i could go to new york and feel comfortable and they could come out here and be comfortable maybe you dont like your job maybe you didnt get enough sleep well nobody likes their job nobody got enough sleep maybe you just had the worst day of your life but you know theres no escape theres no excuse so just suck up and be nice never try to impress a woman because if you do shell expect you to keep up the standard for the rest of your life never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering too often in life something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled so the point is we all have choices and we make the choice to accept people or situations or to not accept situations the life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end nor protects it from the bites of insects i think what makes our marriage work amid all the glare is that my husband is my best friend he inspires everything in my life and enables me to do the best that i can i want to hang out with him more than anyone life would be tolerable but for its amusements dreams do come true if we only wish hard enough you can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it you are going to let the fear of poverty govern you life and your reward will be that you will eat but you will not live i believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear i really dont think life is about the icouldhavebeens life is only about the itriedtodo i dont mind the failure but i cant imagine that id forgive myself if i didnt try we continue to shape our personality all our life if we knew ourselves perfectly we should die it is better to create than to learn creating is the essence of life what if you gave someone a gift and they neglected to thank you for it  would you be likely to give them another life is the same way in order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer you must truly appreciate what you already have there is a vitality a life force an energy a quickening that is translated through you into action and because there is only one of you in all time this expression is unique these technologies can make life easier can let us touch people we might not otherwise you may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups get medical information the latest experimental drugs these things can profoundly influence life im not downplaying that life is very interesting in the end some of your greatest pains become your greatest strengths today is lifethe only life you are sure of make the most of today get interested in something shake yourself awake develop a hobby let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you live today with gusto every year of my life i grow more convinced that it is wisest and best to fix our attention on the beautiful and the good and dwell as little as possible on the evil and the false this is love to fly toward a secret sky to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment first to let go of life finally to take a step without feet maxim for life you get treated in life the way you teach people to treat you every man is the architect of his own life he builds it just the way he wants it however after he has built what he wants he sometimes decides that he doesnt like what he has built and looks for someone or something to blame instead of changing himself whatever you do in life surround yourself with smart people wholl argue with you every human is an artist the dream of your life is to make beautiful art character in the long run is the decisive factor in the life of an individual and of nations alike blood relatives often have nothing to do with family and similarly family is about who you choose to make your life with i believe this with all my heart the greatest coach of all time in my eyes is my mom shes instilled in me a toughness and a perseverance and just a neverquit mentality and i thank her every day for providing me for what she sacrificed her life for how do you go from where you are to where you wanna be and i think you have to have an enthusiasm for life you have to have a dream a goal and you have to be willing to work for it the real test of friendship is can you literally do nothing with the other person can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple the most glorious moments in your life are not the socalled days of success but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life and the promise of future accomplishments you come to a point in your life when you really dont care what people think about you you just care what you think about yourself a welldeveloped sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life ive been absolutely terrified every moment of my life  and ive never let it keep me from doing a single thing i wanted to do do the best you can and dont take life too serious we only live once but once is enough if we do it right live your life with class dignity and style so that an exclamation rather than a question mark signifies it life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves i actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when youre trying to make money and then go to another meeting where youre giving it away i mean is it gonna erode your ability you know to make money are you gonna somehow get confused about what youre trying to do attention to health is lifes greatest hindrance friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil school is practice for future life practice makes perfect and nobodys perfect so why practice at times in my life the only place i have been happy is when i am on stage what you get is a living what you give is a life be patient and understanding life is too short to be vengeful or malicious i havent lived a perfect life i have regrets but thats from a lifetime of taking chances making decisions and trying not to be frozen the only thing that i can do with my regrets is understand them the value of life lies not in the length of days but in the use we make of them whether you find satisfaction in life depends not on your tale of years but on your will my trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life is what keeps me moving forward it takes half your life before you discover life is a doityourself project he who binds to himself a joy does the winged life destroy but he who kisses the joy as it flies lives in eternitys sun rise let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children communication is a skill that you can learn its like riding a bicycle or typing if youre willing to work at it you can rapidly improve the quality of evry part of your life life lived for tomorrow will always be just a day away from being realized i never did a days work in my life it was all fun let love flow so that it cleanses the world then man can live in peace instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life with all those material interests and earthly ambitions sometimes its the smallest decisions that can change your life forever there is a fountain of youth it is your mind your talents the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love when you learn to tap this source you will truly have defeated age life is just one damned thing after another thats the way i got along in life i dont ever remember being particularly jealous of anybody because i figured if i cant do it myself i dont deserve to get it love we say is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death the happiness of this life depends less on what befalls you than the way in which you take it it is possible to become discouraged about the injustice we see everywhere but god did not promise us that the world would be humane and just he gives us the gift of life and allows us to choose the way we will use our limited time on earth it is an awesome opportunity and by the way everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it and the imagination to improvise the worst enemy to creativity is selfdoubt man is subject to innumerable pains and sorrows by the very condition of humanity and yet as if nature had not sown evils enough in life we are continually adding grief to grief and aggravating the common calamity by our cruel treatment of one another television is not real life in real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs to expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness we have to be able to grow up our wrinkles are our medals of the passage of life they are what we have been through and who we want to be polygamy an endeavour to get more out of life than there is in it what material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter and that is being able to make a difference not only in your own life but in other peoples lives my alma mater was books a good library i could spend the rest of my life reading just satisfying my curiosity live by this credo have a little laugh at life and look around you for happiness instead of sadness laughter has always brought me out of unhappy situations its not the men in my life that count its the life in my men life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next what theyre not ready for is guys like you and i and nails and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life that we are high priests vatican assassin warlocks boom print that people see where that goes i blame my mother for my poor sex life all she told me was the man goes on top and the woman underneath for three years my husband and i slept in bunk beds imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life sleep  the most beautiful experience in life  except drink art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life be strong believe in freedom and in god love yourself understand your sexuality have a sense of humor masturbate dont judge people by their religion color or sexual habits love life and your family for if there is a sin against life it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life as a remedy to life in society i would suggest the big city nowadays it is the only desert within our means it is normal to give away a little of ones life in order not to lose it all ive always taken the wizard of oz very seriously you know i believe in the idea of the rainbow and ive spent my entire life trying to get over it the highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about nor read about nor seen but if one will are to be lived there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like a pebble drops some careless word it overflows and its secret spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together its funny the way most people love the dead once you are dead you are made for life life takes its path and sometimes there are people to blame of course there are bad people in this world good bad it happens unfortunately but in a way i think if there was more focus on the good more good would happen life all comes down to a few moments this is one of them the joy of life consists in the exercise of ones energies continual growth constant change the enjoyment of every new experience to stop means simply to die the eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal ones family is the most important thing in life i look at it this way one of these days ill be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me and the only people wholl be with me will be my family the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life i like people that enjoy life cause i do the same for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life so if you stay ready you aint gotta get ready and that is how i run my life life is too short to spend hoping that the perfectly arched eyebrow or hottest new lip shade will mask an ugly heart we dont get a chance to do that many things and every one should be really excellent because this is our life life is brief and then you die you know so this is what weve chosen to do with our life if i had to choose a religion the sun as the universal giver of life would be my god life is made up not of great sacrifices or duties but of little things in which smiles and kindness and small obligations given habitually are what preserve the heart and secure comfort there has never yet been a man in our history who led a life of ease whose name is worth remembering i just got one last thing i urge all of you all of you to enjoy your life the precious moments you have to spend each day with some laughter and some thought to get youre emotions going do what you love to do and give it your very best whether its business or baseball or the theater or any field if you dont love what youre doing and you cant give it your best get out of it life is too short youll be an old man before you know it i dont think you ever stop giving i really dont i think its an ongoing process and its not just about being able to write a check its being able to touch somebodys life faith is the first factor in a life devoted to service without it nothing is possible with it nothing is impossible my goal is to be one with the music i just dedicate my whole life to this art a life lived with integrity  even if it lacks the trappings of fame and fortune is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come if a man can bridge the gap between life and death if he can live on after hes dead then maybe he was a great man i like the idea of being alone i like the idea of often being alone in all aspects of my life i like to feel lonely i like to need things life is what we make it always has been always will be for the meaning of life differs from man to man from day to day and from hour to hour what matters therefore is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others by means of love friendship indignation and compassion im at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life in fact ive just had a mirror put over my kitchen table if i have any worth it is to live my life for god so as to teach these peoples even though some of them still look down on me life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone i really believe that everyone has a talent ability or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life i lost my sense of trust honesty and compassion i crashed down and became what i consider an emotional mess ive never been so miserable in my whole life i just wanted to go to bed and never get up i have found it easier to identify with the characters who verge upon hysteria who were frightened of life who were desperate to reach out to another person but these seemingly fragile people are the strong people really life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives i have been up against tough competition all my life i wouldnt know how to get along without it life is all memory except for the one present moment that goes by you so quickly you hardly catch it going i have a lot of things to prove to myself one is that i can live my life fearlessly you make mistakes but i dont have any regrets im the kind of person who takes responsibility for it and deals with it i learn from everything i do i work very hard i have so many things going on in my life get to know me and see who i am photography takes an instant out of time altering life by holding it still lifes pretty good and why wouldnt it be im a pirate after all sorrow is knowledge those that know the most must mourn the deepest the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are doing creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea creativity gives the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone creativity makes life more fun and more interesting gratitude helps you to grow and expand gratitude brings joy and laughter into your life and into the lives of all those around you if i were to say god why me about the bad things then i should have said god why me about the good things that happened in my life music is love love is music music is life and i love my life thank you and good night i was set free because my greatest fear had been realized and i still had a daughter who i adored and i had an old typewriter and a big idea and so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life i dont think ive ever worked so hard on something but working on macintosh was the neatest experience of my life almost everyone who worked on it will say that none of us wanted to release it at the end it was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands it wouldnt be ours anymore words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life the longer i live the more convinced i become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it ill always stay connected with apple i hope that throughout my life ill sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of apple weave in and out of each other like a tapestry there may be a few years when im not there but ill always come back friends are as companions on a journey who ought to aid each other to persevere in the road to a happier life the first thing which i can record concerning myself is that i was born these are wonderful words this life to which neither time nor eternity can bring diminution  this everlasting living soul began my mind loses itself in these depths take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life when it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude he who is void of virtuous attachments in private life is or very soon will be void of all regard for his country there is seldom an instance of a man guilty of betraying his country who had not before lost the feeling of moral obligations in his private connections sometimes i feel like one who is on the sidelines who has missed life itself hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is a brokenwinged bird that cannot fly life is to be entered upon with courage difficult times have helped me to understand better than before how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever haters never win i just think thats true about life because negative energy always costs in the end in life you need either inspiration or desperation they tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person your problem is how you are going to spend this one odd and precious life you have been issued whether youre going to spend it trying to look good and creating the illusion that you have power over people and circumstances or whether you are going to taste it enjoy it and find out the truth about who you are you cant make positive choices for the rest of your life without an environment that makes those choices easy natural and enjoyable woz is living his own life now he hasnt been around apple for about five years but what he did will go down in history half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have rushed through life trying to save choice of attention  to pay attention to this and ignore that  is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer in both cases a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences whatever they may be it is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all ones life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than try to be a little kinder i think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life sometimes you trust someone who turns out not to be honest there are a lot of things that happen in life that dont turn out the way youre given the impression that they will and i think thats all kind of a con but i think weve probably all been hurt my guiding principles in life are to be honest genuine thoughtful and caring be thou the rainbow in the storms of life the evening beam that smiles the clouds away and tints tomorrow with prophetic ray i do not believe in excuses i believe in hard work as the prime solvent of lifes problems i made a mistake by being ejected from the presidency next time i will choose a cabinet which will allow me to be life president life is too short to worry about anything you had better enjoy it because the next day promises nothing the personal life deeply lived always expands into truths beyond itself you must pass your days in song let your whole life be a song a bachelors life is a fine breakfast a flat lunch and a miserable dinner if you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life with confidence you have won even before you have started you know what your problem is its that you havent seen enough movies  all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies life is 10 what happens to you and 90 how you react to it you were made by god and for god and until you understand that life will never make sense life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle my general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day i never do anything with a feeling of oh god ive got to do this today when you do the common things in life in an uncommon way you will command the attention of the world without knowing what i am and why i am here life is impossible my focus is to forget the pain of life forget the pain mock the pain reduce it and laugh life is lived on the edge life opens up opportunities to you and you either take them or you stay afraid of taking them part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles but in avoiding them a masterly retreat is in itself a victory never build your emotional life on the weaknesses of others justice in the life and conduct of the state is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens a dog will teach you unconditional love if you can have that in your life things wont be too bad you are doomed to make choices this is lifes greatest paradox i wish to preach not the doctrine of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the strenuous life you use your money to buy privacy because during most of your life you arent allowed to be normal i lead no party i follow no leader i have given the best part of my life to careful study of islam its law and polity its culture its history and its literature we must declare ourselves become known allow the world to discover this subterranean life of ours which connects kings and farm boys artists and clerks let them see that the important thing is not the object of love but the emotion itself faith means living with uncertainty  feeling your way through life letting your heart guide you like a lantern in the dark you see in life lots of people know what to do but few people actually do what they know knowing is not enough you must take action life is not an easy matter you cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery above weakness above all kinds of perfidy and baseness i have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream when i lock into someone or something you cant get me away from it because i commit that thoroughly thats in friendship thats a deal thats a commitment dont give me paper  i can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it but if you shake my hand thats for life find ecstasy in life the mere sense of living is joy enough you hear a lot about god these days god the beneficent god the allgreat god the almighty god the most powerful god the giver of life god the creator of death i mean were hearing about god all the time so we better learn how to deal with it but if we know anything about god god is arbitrary death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live just when i think i have learned the way to live life changes i remember a specific moment watching my grandmother hang the clothes on the line and her saying to me you are going to have to learn to do this and me being in that space of awareness and knowing that my life would not be the same as my grandmothers life when life knocks you down try to land on your back because if you can look up you can get up let your reason get you back up a lot of us grow up and we grow out of the literal interpretation that we get when were children but we bear the scars all our life whether theyre scars of beauty or scars of ugliness its pretty much in the eye of the beholder in the last analysis the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for finding himself if he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence every life has a measure of sorrow and sometimes this is what awakens us its surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves and if youre not comfortable within yourself you cant be comfortable with others my philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life but doing the best at this moment puts you i the best place for the next moment people have a moral standard about what they will do and will not do at the end of the day someone who cheats has a lower moral standard than someone who does not and they will cheat in other areas of life as well the tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives  the death of genuine feeling the death of inspired response the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself a man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror having down syndrome is like being born normal i am just like you and you are just like me we are all born in different ways that is the way i can describe it i have a normal life saving faith is an immediate relation to christ accepting receiving resting upon him alone for justification sanctification and eternal life by virtue of gods grace cease trying to work everything out with your minds it will get you nowhere live by intuition and inspiration and let your whole life be revelation if you wish to succeed in life make perseverance your bosom friend experience your wise counselor caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius i havent understood a bar of music in my life but i have felt it this is the highest wisdom that i own freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew not by appointment do we meet delight or joy they heed not our expectancy but round some corner of the streets of life they of a sudden greet us with a smile the meaning of life is contained in every single expression of life it is present in the infinity of forms and phenomena that exist in all of creation the highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence millions of young americans have graduated from college during the obama presidency ready to use their gifts and get moving in life half of them cant find the work they studied for or any work at all so heres the question without a change in leadership why would the next four years be any different from the last four years the game of life is a game of boomerangs our thoughts deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy if a man neglects education he walks lame to the end of his life all my life ive looked at words as though i were seeing them for the first time love is the greatest refreshment in life because we have so much eye candy and mind candy spending so much time trying to pay the rent all of this conspires to keep us from thinking too hard or taking action from that our time is stolen so much of our daily life is stolen i spent my whole life in the private sector 25 years in the private sector i understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people it makes it more difficult for them to buy things if they cant buy things the economy doesnt grow if the economy doesnt grow we dont put americans to work black consciousness is an attitude of the mind and a way of life the most positive call to emanate from the black world for a long time i dont believe in an afterlife so i dont have to spend my whole life fearing hell or fearing heaven even more for whatever the tortures of hell i think the boredom of heaven would be even worse the safest course is to do nothing against ones conscience with this secret we can enjoy life and have no fear from death with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy we see into the life of things to have courage for whatever comes in life  everything lies in that the changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life i have dreamed in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas they have gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind no one is in control of your happiness but you therefore you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change the purpose of human life is to serve and to show compassion and the will to help others ive made some great mistakes in my life but you know they were honest mistakes to gather with gods people in united adoration of the father is as necessary to the christian life as prayer telling a teenager the facts of life is like giving a fish a bath the good life is a process not a state of being it is a direction not a destination somebody should tell us right at the start of our lives that we are dying then we might live life to the limit every minute of every day do it i say whatever you want to do do it now there are only so many tomorrows i dont think i could live without hair makeup and styling let alone be the performer i am i am a glamour girl through and through i believe in the glamorous life and i live one the greatest humiliation in life is to work hard on something from which you expect great appreciation and then fail to get it as we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities yes you can lose somebody overnight yes your whole life can be turned upside down life is short it can come and go like a feather in the wind tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life thats really where failure comes trust is the glue of life its the most essential ingredient in effective communication its the foundational principle that holds all relationships if you find someone you love in your life then hang on to that love it is a common saying and in everybodys mouth that life is but a sojourn there is no force like success and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it as of the individual so should it be of the nation when youre passionate about something you want it to be all it can be but in the endgame of life i fundamentally believe the key to happiness is letting go of that idea of perfection being taken for granted can be a compliment it means that youve become a comfortable trusted element in another persons life the more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life the clearer we should see through it our heavenly father understands our disappointment suffering pain fear and doubt he is always there to encourage our hearts and help us understand that hes sufficient for all of our needs when i accepted this as an absolute truth in my life i found that my worrying stopped i wanted to write about the moment when your addictions no longer hide the truth from you when your whole life breaks down thats the moment when you have to somehow choose what your life is going to be about im a heroine addict i need to have sex with women who have saved someones life thank you god for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough i never regret anything because every little detail of your life is what made you into who you are in the end life belongs to the living and he who lives must be prepared for changes you cant live your life blaming your failures on your parents and what they did or didnt do for you youre dealt the cards that youre dealt i realised it was a waste of time to be angry at my parents and feel sorry for myself take a chance all life is a chance the man who goes farthest is generally the one who is willing to do and dare early in life i had to choose between honest arrogance and hypocritical humility i chose the former and have seen no reason to change what we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life there is only one success  to be able to spend your life in your own way smoking kills if youre killed youve lost a very important part of your life the highest use of capital is not to make more money but to make money do more for the betterment of life
