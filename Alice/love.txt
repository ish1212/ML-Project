being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead friends can help each other a true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself  and especially to feel or not feel whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them thats what real love amounts to  letting a person be what he really is sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deepburning and unquenchable love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies i have decided to stick with love hate is too great a burden to bear affection is responsible for ninetenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives immature love says i love you because i need you mature love says i need you because i love you where there is love there is life were born alone we live alone we die alone only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone a loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge a man reserves his true and deepest love not for the species of woman in whose company he finds himself electrified and enkindled but for that one in whose company he may feel tenderly drowsy i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love for it was not into my ear you whispered but into my heart it was not my lips you kissed but my soul a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous let us always meet each other with smile for the smile is the beginning of love a flower cannot blossom without sunshine and man cannot live without love if you live to be a hundred i want to live to be a hundred minus one day so i never have to live without you gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love love begins at home and it is not how much we do but how much love we put in that action love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does love is a battle love is a war love is a growing up can miles truly separate you from friends if you want to be with someone you love arent you already there a woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea a man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him love is a force more formidable than any other it is invisible  it cannot be seen or measured yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment and offer you more joy than any material possession could time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity do all things with love a kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires i was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it at the touch of love everyone becomes a poet love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another love yourself first and everything else falls into line you really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world we love life not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving love is a better teacher than duty come live in my heart and pay no rent love is always bestowed as a gift  freely willingly and without expectation we dont love to be loved we love to love love is like war easy to begin but very hard to stop if you press me to say why i loved him i can say no more than because he was he and i was i the hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread love is life and if you miss love you miss life the best thing to hold onto in life is each other what we have once enjoyed we can never lose all that we love deeply becomes a part of us as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words faith makes all things possible love makes all things easy friendship often ends in love but love in friendship  never a very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue a wonderful living side by side can grow if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky the best proof of love is trust a part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve love isnt something you find love is something that finds you i like not only to be loved but also to be told i am loved we loved with a love that was more than love a pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit a loving heart is the truest wisdom all my life my heart has yearned for a thing i cannot name the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves love can sometimes be magic but magic can sometimes just be an illusion first love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired i can live without money but i cannot live without love love is the flower youve got to let grow true love is like ghosts which everyone talks about and few have seen the hours i spend with you i look upon as sort of a perfumed garden a dim twilight and a fountain singing to it you and you alone make me feel that i am alive other men it is said have seen angels but i have seen thee and thou art enough all love shifts and changes i dont know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all someday after mastering the winds the waves the tides and gravity we shall harness for god the energies of love and then for a second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire everything is clearer when youre in love the way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love i was about half in love with her by the time we sat down thats the thing about girls every time they do something pretty you fall half in love with them and then you never know where the hell you are who being loved is poor love is a game that two can play and both win for small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love the one thing we can never get enough of is love and the one thing we never give enough is love love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own the giving of love is an education in itself all mankind love a lover you will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love if you wish to be loved show more of your faults than your virtues dont brood get on with living and loving you dont have forever the moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth the delight the ecstasy of it you will discover that for you the world is transformed it is sad not to love but it is much sadder not to be able to love love is of all passions the strongest for it attacks simultaneously the head the heart and the senses the art of love is largely the art of persistence love is a friendship set to music there is no remedy for love but to love more if you want to be loved be lovable love is the beauty of the soul love possesses not nor will it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence to say i love you one must first be able to say the i before i met my husband id never fallen in love id stepped in it a few times if you would be loved love and be loveable love many things for therein lies the true strength and whosoever loves much performs much and can accomplish much and what is done in love is done well love does not dominate it cultivates only do what your heart tells you you never lose by loving you always lose by holding back love it surrounds every being and extends slowly to embrace all that shall be love is the joy of the good the wonder of the wise the amazement of the gods love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination its useless to hold a person to anything he says while hes in love drunk or running for office love is a gross exaggeration of the difference between one person and everybody else what love weve given well have forever what love we fail to give will be lost for all eternity to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already three parts dead one is loved because one is loved no reason is needed for loving love is being stupid together love is when you meet someone who tells you something new about yourself it is difficult to know at what moment love begins it is less difficult to know that it has begun how absurd and delicious it is to be in love with somebody younger than yourself everybody should try it in love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two when love is not madness it is not love the love we give away is the only love we keep love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit blessed is the influence of one true loving human soul on another to love another person is to see the face of god a kiss is a rosy dot over the i of loving love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence absence  that common cure of love life is the flower for which love is the honey the only abnormality is the incapacity to love there is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists or simulate it where it does not love consists in this that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other be of love a little more careful than of anything whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within a new command i give you love one another as i have loved you so you must love one another love is supreme and unconditional like is nice but limited gestures in love are incomparably more attractive effective and valuable than words looking back i have this to regret that too often when i loved i did not say so i love that feeling of being in love the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning that is special i believe in the compelling power of love i do not understand it i believe it to be the most fragrant blossom of all this thorny existence lord grant that i might not so much seek to be loved as to love sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence there is a woman at the begining of all great things love knows not distance it hath no continent its eyes are for the stars the sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love the degree of loving is measured by the degree of giving people think love is an emotion love is good sense love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment it is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation love is the greatest refreshment in life there is only one kind of love but there are a thousand imitations love is the delusion that one woman differs from another if you wished to be loved love love is my religion  i could die for it tell me who admires and loves you and i will tell you who you are love shall be our token love be yours and love be mine he is not a lover who does not love forever love is the hardest habit to break and the most difficult to satisfy when we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before the most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire love is all we have the only way that each can help the other choose your love love your choice falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the common sense love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few if you could only love enough you could be the most powerful person in the world to witness two lovers is a spectacle for the gods love means to commit yourself without guarantee follow love and it will flee flee love and it will follow thee the way to know life is to love many things your words are my food your breath my wine you are everything to me the fact is that love is of two kinds one which commands and one which obeys the two are quite distinct and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love love takes up where knowledge leaves off fortune and love favor the brave there is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved it is gods finger on mans shoulder each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life love is suffering one side always loves more love is what youve been through with somebody love looks through a telescope envy through a microscope love in its essence is spiritual fire there are never enough i love yous love is always being given where it is not required friendship is love without his wings come live with me and be my love and we will all the pleasures prove that valleys groves hills and fields woods or steepy mountain yields the truth is that there is only one terminal dignity  love and the story of a love is not important  what is important is that one is capable of love it is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity we are all born for love it is the principle of existence and its only end love is the poetry of the senses there is always something left to love and if you aint learned that you aint learned nothing love means to love that which is unlovable or it is no virtue at all people who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy love is not only something you feel it is something you do love is the great miracle cure loving ourselves works miracles in our lives in every living thing there is the desire for love love is but the discovery of ourselves in others and the delight in the recognition for love is immortality we may give without loving but we cannot love without giving love conquers all sometimes its hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man to love abundantly is to live abundantly and to love forever is to live forever love is that splendid triggering of human vitality the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else when you love a man he becomes more than a body his physical limbs expand and his outline recedes vanishes he is rich and sweet and right he is part of the world the atmosphere the blue sky and the blue water if you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws you can love other people so much better and that makes you so happy say what you will tis better to be left than never to have been loved sympathy constitutes friendship but in love there is a sort of antipathy or opposing passion each strives to be the other and both together make up one whole love is the power to see similarity in the dissimilar if thou must love me let it be for naught except for loves sake only take away love and our earth is a tomb love is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young the habituation of the middleaged and the mutual dependence of the old love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion do you have to have a reason for loving the first magic of love is our ignorance that it can ever end loves greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred the quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love when youre in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love or if it attributes them to her whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you from her or from the meeting of your sparks what the world really needs is more love and less paper work woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope to love  and to put its trust in life let no one who loves be unhappy even love unreturned has its rainbow i dont know that love changes people change circumstances change no one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved he who loves flies runs and rejoices he is free and nothing holds him back love is the only gold to love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides it is easier to love humanity as a whole than to love ones neighbor though lovers be lost love shall not nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold when you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out love means not ever having to say youre sorry there is no limit to the power of loving love you will find only where you may show yourself weak without provoking strength love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope even the ruins to which it clings o thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars love is a mutual selfgiving which ends in selfrecovery to love for the sake of being loved is human but to love for the sake of loving is angelic you dont want to love  your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved you arent positive youre negative you absorb absorb as if you must fill yourself up with love because youve got a shortage somewhere there is more pleasure in loving than in being beloved when love is at its best one loves so much that he cannot forget love is like a faucet it turns off and on more than kisses letters mingle souls stand by your man give him two arms to cling to and something warm to come to love is metaphysical gravity there is room in the smallest cottage for a happy loving pair who loves raves with our love we could save the world pains of love be sweeter far than all other pleasures are to good and true love fear is forever affixed what is love it is the morning and the evening star ultimately love is everything true love is quiescent except in the nascent moments of true humility only love interests me and i am only in contact with things that revolve around love you dont have to go looking for love when its where you come from it is very easy to love alone who so loves believes the impossible only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge the richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time we perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret all love is vanquished by a succeeding love we can only learn to love by loving we are most alive when were in love who ever loved that loved not at first sight love is when he gives you a piece of your soul that you never knew was missing love is an energy which exists of itself it is its own value in love there are two things  bodies and words we love but once for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving i long for the raised voice the howl of rage or love love is loves reward but loves a malady without a cure love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident a tight girdle a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over philadelphia is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being who would give a law to lovers love is unto itself a higher law love is blind when we lose one we love our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough the cure for all the ills and wrongs the cares the sorrows and the crimes of humanity all lie in the one word love it is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life oh love will make a dog howl in rhyme love is a hole in the heart love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat in our life there is a single color as on an artists palette which provides the meaning of life and art it is the color of love to enlarge or illustrate this power and effect of love is to set a candle in the sun one must not trifle with love all love is lost but upon god alone darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that life is a song  sing it life is a game  play it life is a challenge  meet it life is a dream  realize it life is a sacrifice  offer it life is love  enjoy it we must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive he who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love there is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us when we discover this we are less prone to hate our enemies love all trust a few do wrong to none when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace you can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself and that person is not to be found anywhere you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life a successful marriage requires falling in love many times always with the same person spread love everywhere you go let no one ever come to you without leaving happier i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word all major religious traditions carry basically the same message that is love compassion and forgiveness the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality this is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant to love beauty is to see light there is a sacredness in tears they are not the mark of weakness but of power they speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues they are the messengers of overwhelming grief of deep contrition and of unspeakable love my great hope is to laugh as much as i cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages love and compassion are necessities not luxuries without them humanity cannot survive dont aim for success if you want it just do what you love and believe in and it will come naturally it is easy to hate and it is difficult to love this is how the whole scheme of things works all good things are difficult to achieve and bad things are very easy to get i love people who make me laugh i honestly think its the thing i like most to laugh it cures a multitude of ills its probably the most important thing in a person when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive  to breathe to think to enjoy to love the love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge aggression and retaliation the foundation of such a method is love there can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love love begins by taking care of the closest ones  the ones at home if music be the food of love play on never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you love prayer and forgiveness if you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies  or else the chain reaction of evil  hate begetting hate wars producing more wars  must be broken or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation hatred does not cease by hatred but only by love this is the eternal rule all you need is love but a little chocolate now and then doesnt hurt happiness cannot be traveled to owned earned worn or consumed happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love grace and gratitude i love those who can smile in trouble who can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but they whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves their conduct will pursue their principles unto death if you love life dont waste time for time is what life is made up of before marriage a girl has to make love to a man to hold him after marriage she has to hold him to make love to him it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important at the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love love recognizes no barriers it jumps hurdles leaps fences penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope friends show their love in times of trouble not in happiness between men and women there is no friendship possible there is passion enmity worship love but no friendship let us more and more insist on raising funds of love of kindness of understanding of peace money will come if we seek first the kingdom of god  the rest will be given let us not be satisfied with just giving money money is not enough money can be got but they need your hearts to love them so spread your love everywhere you go you cant stop loving or wanting to love because when its right its the best thing in the world when youre in a relationship and its good even if nothing else in your life is right you feel like your whole world is complete a coward is incapable of exhibiting love it is the prerogative of the brave you cant blame gravity for falling in love never trust anyone completely but god love people but put your full trust only in god if you love someone set them free if they come back theyre yours if they dont they never were i love being married its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life if you love somebody let them go for if they return they were always yours and if they dont they never were i love you when you bow in your mosque kneel in your temple pray in your church for you and i are sons of one religion and it is the spirit i say what i want to say and do what i want to do theres no in between people will either love you for it or hate you for it it is not enough to say we must not wage war it is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection people love chopping wood in this activity one immediately sees results the foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty character integrity faith love and loyalty love is friendship that has caught fire it is quiet understanding mutual confidence sharing and forgiving it is loyalty through good and bad times it settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses if you want a love message to be heard it has got to be sent out to keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own jealousy is a disease love is a healthy condition the immature mind often mistakes one for the other or assumes that the greater the love the greater the jealousy intense love does not measure it just gives but let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls even the rich are hungry for love for being cared for for being wanted for having someone to call their own love is a fruit in season at all times and within reach of every hand i love mirrors they let one pass through the surface of things be impeccable with your word speak with integrity say only what you mean avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love the beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves and not to twist them to fit our own image otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them if we listened to our intellect wed never have a love affair wed never have a friendship wed never go into business because wed be cynical well thats nonsense youve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down kindness in words creates confidence kindness in thinking creates profoundness kindness in giving creates love anyway no drug not even alcohol causes the fundamental ills of society if were looking for the source of our troubles we shouldnt test people for drugs we should test them for stupidity ignorance greed and love of power the beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes because that is the doorway to her heart the place where love resides and ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation the things that will destroy america are prosperityatanyprice peaceatanyprice safetyfirst instead of dutyfirst the love of soft living and the getrichquick theory of life absence from those we love is self from self  a deadly banishment love of beauty is taste the creation of beauty is art i honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you men always want to be a womans first love  women like to be a mans last romance love is like a beautiful flower which i may not touch but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same i love sleep my life has the tendency to fall apart when im awake you know if we lose love and self respect for each other this is how we finally die there is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work this is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in  that we do it to god to christ and thats why we try to do it as beautifully as possible the course of true love never did run smooth i know of only one duty and that is to love one should always be in love that is the reason one should never marry weve got this gift of love but love is like a precious plant you cant just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think its going to get on by itself youve got to keep watering it youve got to really look after it and nurture it a man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her the greatest gift that you can give to others is the gift of unconditional love and acceptance many people mistake our work for our vocation our vocation is the love of jesus your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it forgiveness is the final form of love the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls i try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money no i wouldnt touch a leper for a thousand pounds yet i willingly cure him for the love of god if someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the sixties thats his problem love and peace are eternal the first duty of love is to listen i see when men love women they give them but a little of their lives but women when they love give everything work is love made visible and if you cannot work with love but only with distaste it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love god better because of them there are four questions of value in life what is sacred of what is the spirit made what is worth living for and what is worth dying for the answer to each is the same only love rare as is true love true friendship is rarer power is of two kinds one is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment we are not the same persons this year as last nor are those we love it is a happy chance if we changing continue to love a changed person god proved his love on the cross when christ hung and bled and died it was god saying to the world i love you falling in love and having a relationship are two different things accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you together but do so with all your heart trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living it is the beginning place the foundation upon which more can be built where trust is love can flourish as selfishness and complaint pervert the mind so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision when you fish for love bait with your heart not your brain i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction the man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends love is like a virus it can happen to anybody at any time it has always seemed strange to me the things we admire in men kindness and generosity openness honesty understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system and those traits we detest sharpness greed acquisitiveness meanness egotism and selfinterest are the traits of success and while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels simply by pouring out love love is infectious and the greatest healing energy christmas my child is love in action every time we love every time we give its christmas we never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves i love the man that can smile in trouble that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death love is a serious mental disease to love means loving the unlovable to forgive means pardoning the unpardonable faith means believing the unbelievable hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless i love those who yearn for the impossible love to faults is always blind always is to joy inclined lawless winged and unconfined and breaks all chains from every mind what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like the sadness of the womens movement is that they dont allow the necessity of love see i dont personally trust any revolution where love is not allowed love fall in love and stay in love write only what you love and love what you write the key word is love you have to get up in the morning and write something you love something to live for i love life because what more is there where we love is home  home that our feet may leave but not our hearts rather than love than money than fame give me truth but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust show me your hands do they have scars from giving show me your feet are they wounded in service show me your heart have you left a place for divine love once in his life every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead all everything that i understand i understand only because i love knowledge is love and light and vision love sought is good but given unsought is better i guess i have always been deeply terrified to really be someones wife since i know from life one cannot love another ever really who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make love known the game of basketball has been everything to me my place of refuge place ive always gone where i needed comfort and peace its been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction its a relationship that has evolved over time given me the greatest respect and love for the game i have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate  its apathy its not giving a damn we cant command our love but we can our actions one advantage of marriage is that when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you it keeps you together until you fall in again if you want to be successful its just this simple know what you are doing love what you are doing and believe in what you are doing politics is such a torment that i advise everyone i love not to mix with it justice that love gives is a surrender justice that law gives is a punishment find joy in everything you choose to do every job relationship home its your responsibility to love it or change it speak low if you speak love im not claiming divinity ive never claimed purity of soul ive never claimed to have the answers to life i only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as i can but i still believe in peace love and understanding true love doesnt happen right away its an evergrowing process it develops after youve gone through many ups and downs when youve suffered together cried together laughed together this is one of the miracles of love it gives a power of seeing through its own enchantments and yet not being disenchanted the best smell in the world is that man that you love love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls love is blind friendship closes its eyes love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings i do all the evil i can before i learn to shun it is it not enough to know the evil to shun it if not we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up love is too young to know what conscience is what light is to the eyes  what air is to the lungs  what love is to the heart liberty is to the soul of man love will find a way through paths where wolves fear to prey a friendship that like love is warm a love like friendship steady respect is what we owe love what we give love is not love that alters when it alteration finds where love is there god is also all you need is love women love us for our defects if we have enough of them they will forgive us everything even our gigantic intellects no matter how dark the moment love and hope are always possible when a man has once loved a woman he will do anything for her except continue to love her hatred is blind as well as love who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies the love of heaven makes one heavenly love cannot save you from your own fate love is the answer and you know that for sure love is a flower youve got to let it grow if we love our country we should also love our countrymen they do not love that do not show their love mans nature is not essentially evil brute nature has been know to yield to the influence of love you must never despair of human nature there is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love im an introvert i love being by myself love being outdoors love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees flowers the sky those whom the gods love grow young presents dont really mean much to me i dont want to sound mawkish but  it was the realization that i have a great many people in my life who really love me and who i really love flatter me and i may not believe you criticize me and i may not like you ignore me and i may not forgive you encourage me and i will not forget you love me and i may be forced to love you is it not enough to know the evil to shun it if not we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up love is never lost if not reciprocated it will flow back and soften and purify the heart do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman wholl give you a little love a little affection a little tenderness it means youre in the wrong house thats what it means yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors but today we kneel only to truth follow only beauty and obey only love the motherchild relationship is paradoxical and in a sense tragic it requires the most intense love on the mothers side yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother and to become fully independent ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country love is trembling happiness even when im old and grey i wont be able to play it but ill still love the game i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge that myth is more potent than history that dreams are more powerful than facts that hope always triumphs over experience that laughter is the only cure for grief and i believe that love is stronger than death dont do anything by half if you love someone love them with all your soul when you go to work work your ass off when you hate someone hate them until it hurts love and doubt have never been on speaking terms a dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life dost thou love life then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of money cant buy love but it improves your bargaining position do not hire a man who does your work for money but him who does it for love of it i wish people would love everybody else the way they love me it would be a better world alcohol may be mans worst enemy but the bible says love your enemy age does not protect you from love but love to some extent protects you from age ill love you dear ill love you till china and africa meet and the river jumps over the mountain and the salmon sing in the street if you cannot work with love but only with distaste it is better that you should leave your work love is the expression of ones values the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another personally i just think rap music is the best thing out there period if you look at my deck in my car radio youre always going to find a hiphop tape thats all i buy thats all i live thats all i listen to thats all i love success comes from taking the initiative and following up persisting eloquently expressing the depth of your love what simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine where theres marriage without love there will be love without marriage i love to be alone i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude he who falls in love with himself will have no rivals the story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye the story of love is hello goodbye when people get married because they think its a longtime love affair theyll be divorced very soon because all love affairs end in disappointment but marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness when love beckons to you follow him though his ways are hard and steep and when his wings enfold you yield to him though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you coming generations will learn equality from poverty and love from woes mothers love is peace it need not be acquired it need not be deserved if a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer but if he spends his days as a speculator shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen the two most misused words in the entire english vocabulary are love and friendship a true friend would die for you so when you start trying to count them on one hand you dont need any fingers there is always some madness in love but there is also always some reason in madness there is no love without forgiveness and there is no forgiveness without love three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for today i love myself as i love my god who could charge me with a sin today i know only sins against my god but who knows my god i know youve heard it a thousand times before but its true  hard work pays off if you want to be good you have to practice practice practice if you dont love something then dont do it one is very crazy when in love it is cruel you know that music should be so beautiful it has the beauty of loneliness of pain of strength and freedom the beauty of disappointment and neversatisfied love the cruel beauty of nature and everlasting beauty of monotony men love to wonder and that is the seed of science do what you love know your own bone gnaw at it bury it unearth it and gnaw it still anxiety is loves greatest killer it makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you you want to save him but you know he will strangle you with his panic guilt for being rich and guilt thinking that perhaps love and peace isnt enough and you have to go and get shot or something i have found that if you love life life will love you back truth is handsomer than the affectation of love your goodness must have some edge to it else it is none because of a great love one is courageous there is not enough love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary beings i have no hostility to nature but a childs love to it i expand and live in the warm day like corn and melons for though we love both the truth and our friends piety requires us to honor the truth first a father may turn his back on his child brothers and sisters may become inveterate enemies husbands may desert their wives wives their husbands but a mothers love endures through all the greatest healing therapy is friendship and love death is a challenge it tells us not to waste time it tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other hallow the body as a temple to comeliness and sanctify the heart as a sacrifice to love love recompenses the adorers sex without love is a meaningless experience but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good i think my passion is misinterpreted as anger sometimes and i dont think people are ready for the message that im delivering and delivering with a sense of violent love a scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar if the great way perishes there will morality and duty when cleverness and knowledge arise great lies will flourish when relatives fall out with one another there will be filial duty and love when states are in confusion there will be faithful servants what do i care about the purring of one who cannot love like the cat no matter what youve done for yourself or for humanity if you cant look back on having given love and attention to your own family what have you really accomplished not necessity not desire  no the love of power is the demon of men let them have everything  health food a place to live entertainment  they are and remain unhappy and lowspirited for the demon waits and waits and will be satisfied the wise are wise only because they love the fool are fools only because they think they can understand love pursue some path however narrow and crooked in which you can walk with love and reverence you dont have to deserve your mothers love you have to deserve your fathers love thy neighbor  and if he happens to be tall debonair and devastating it will be that much easier a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others for anything worth having one must pay the price and the price is always work patience love selfsacrifice  no paper currency no promises to pay but the gold of real service a woman can bring a new love to each man she loves providing there are not too many men who think that a womans past love affairs lessen her love for them are usually stupid and weak i love a natural look in pictures experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love for a lasting union they insist there must be a genuine liking for each other which in my book is a good definition for friendship someday i want to have children and give them all the love i never had i am good but not an angel i do sin but i am not the devil i am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love a strong man doesnt have to be dominant toward a woman he doesnt match his strength against a woman weak with love for him he matches it against the world i love those who do not know how to live for today love is not consolation it is light if youre married and you have a wife and you really love your wife is it good enough to only say to your wife i love her the day you get married or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity and thats how i feel about my relationship with jesus christ is that it is the most important thing in my life friendship may and often does grow into love but love never subsides into friendship this is the hardest of all to close the open hand out of love and keep modest as a giver whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil love matches so called have illusion for their father and need for their mother success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful never go on trips with anyone you do not love work like you dont need the money love like youve never been hurt dance like nobodys watching a woman in love cant be reasonable  or she probably wouldnt be in love love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get  only with what you are expecting to give  which is everything we all want to be in love and find that person who is going to love us no matter how our feet smell no matter how angry we get one day no matter the things we say that we dont mean a tree is known by its fruit a man by his deeds a good deed is never lost he who sows courtesy reaps friendship and he who plants kindness gathers love the great gift of easter is hope  christian hope which makes us have that confidence in god in his ultimate triumph and in his goodness and love which nothing can shake fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soaponarope there is no lonelier man in death except the suicide than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it of all that is written i love only what a person has written with his own blood there is no sincerer love than the love of food ignorance and bungling with love are better than wisdom and skill without honestly id love to be remembered as one of the best to ever pick up a mic but if im doing my part to lessen some racial tension i feel good about what im doing those whom we can love we can hate to others we are indifferent the time i burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice you sacrifice the things you love i love my guitar you can give without loving but you can never love without giving i love the attention but i dont like too much of it do not seek the because  in love there is no because no reason no explanation no solutions a man in love is incomplete until he has married then hes finished i have an everyday religion that works for me love yourself first and everything else falls into line a poet never takes notes you never take notes in a love affair so much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty all other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it because parents have power over children they feel they have to do what their parents say but the love of money is the root of all evil and this is a sweet child and to see him turn like this this isnt him this is not him for one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks the ultimate the last test and proof the work for which all other work is but preparation loyalty and devotion lead to bravery bravery leads to the spirit of selfsacrifice the spirit of selfsacrifice creates trust in the power of love the perfect love affair is one which is conducted entirely by post let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation i love mickey mouse more than any woman i have ever known love comes when manipulation stops when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you when you dare to reveal yourself fully when you dare to be vulnerable life in abundance comes only through great love love and desire are the spirits wings to great deeds everyone has inside of him a piece of good news the good news is that you dont know how great you can be how much you can love what you can accomplish and what your potential is love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives the only creatures that are evolved enough to convey pure love are dogs and infants infuse your life with action dont wait for it to happen make it happen make your own future make your own hope make your own love and whatever your beliefs honor your creator not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high but by doing what you can to make grace happen yourself right now right down here on earth its funny how most people love the dead once youre dead your made for life having a child is surely the most beautifully irrational act that two people in love can commit jealousy contains more of selflove than of love since love grows within you so beauty grows for love is the beauty of the soul may we so love as never to have occasion to repent of our love you either love or you hate you live in the middle you get nothing you gotta love livin baby cause dyin is a pain in the ass it is most unwise for people in love to marry the struggle of my life created empathy  i could relate to pain being abandoned having people not love me three passions simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life the longing for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live let the beauty of what you love be what you do oh the tiger will love you there is no sincerer love than the love of food heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned nor hell a fury like a woman scorned only on paper has humanity yet achieved glory beauty truth knowledge virtue and abiding love my friends and family are my support system they tell me what i need to hear not what i want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times without them i have no idea where i would be and i know that their love for me is whats keeping my head above the water the fickleness of the women i love is only equalled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me i will love the light for it shows me the way yet i will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars love is always open arms if you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself love grows by giving the love we give away is the only love we keep the only way to retain love is to give it away let your religion be less of a theory and more of a love affair all the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers if every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family  and gods love  this world would be a far more gentle and better place the love of economy is the root of all virtue courage is like love it must have hope for nourishment i believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear if love is the answer could you please rephrase the question all the commandments you shall not commit adultery you shall not kill you shall not steal you shall not covet and so on are summed up in this single command you must love your neighbor as yourself no work or love will flourish out of guilt fear or hollowness of heart just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now to love rightly is to love what is orderly and beautiful in an educated and disciplined way christmas in bethlehem the ancient dream a cold clear night made brilliant by a glorious star the smell of incense shepherds and wise men falling to their knees in adoration of the sweet baby the incarnation of perfect love fantasy love is much better than reality love never doing it is very exciting the most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet the most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create to overcome to endure to transform to love and to be greater than our suffering i come from that society and there is a common thread specifically family values  the idea that you do anything for your family and the unconditional love for ones children when women love us they forgive us everything even our crimes when they do not love us they give us credit for nothing not even our virtues anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love love conquers all things except poverty and toothache we always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love  first to their advantage then to their disadvantage let love flow so that it cleanses the world then man can live in peace instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life with all those material interests and earthly ambitions the reason men oppose progress is not that they hate progress but that they love inertia love we say is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death lord make me an instrument of thy peace where there is hatred let me sow love you dont have to be singing about love all the time in order to give love to the people you dont have to keep flashing those words all the time dont forget to love yourself we are never so defensless against suffering as when we love all women have a perception much more developed than men so all women somehow being repressed for so many millennia they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love and this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society there is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love theres only scarcity of resolve to make it happen its not an act i love it its totally original people go whats going on with this guy why does he sound so weird what is going on in his brain i dont know just one day i suddenly woke up with a new brain never make your home in a place make a home for yourself inside your own head youll find what you need to furnish it  memory friends you can trust love of learning and other such things that way it will go with you wherever you journey if i love you what business is it of yours i often try to tell kids to think about all the people who love you dont cry over the one person who doesnt when you have really exhausted an experience you always reverence and love it where there is great love there are always wishes sex without love is merely healthy exercise its funny the way most people love the dead once you are dead you are made for life we need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives mankinds greatest gift also its greatest curse is that we have free choice we can make our choices built from love or from fear love always creates it never destroys in this lies mans only promise animals are reliable many full of love true in their affections predictable in their actions grateful and loyal difficult standards for people to live up to love may be or it may not but where it is it ought to reveal itself in its immensity i love to go to washington  if only to be near my money may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live to keep your marriage brimming with love in the loving cup whenever youre wrong admit it whenever youre right shut up the eskimos had fiftytwo names for snow because it was important to them there ought to be as many for love we the people recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks whats in it for me a freedom without a commitment to others a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense man is an idea and a precious small idea once he turns his back on love the desire for possession is insatiable to such a point that it can survive even love itself to love therefore is to sterilize the person one loves ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others by means of love friendship indignation and compassion i am certainly not an authority on love because there are no authorities on love just those whove had luck with it and those who havent to abandon oneself to principles is really to die  and to die for an impossible love which is the contrary of love friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love humanity i love you because when youre hard up you pawn your intelligence to buy a drink i do not deny that i planned sabotage i did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because i have any love of violence i planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites give a child love laughter and peace not aids a good teacher can inspire hope ignite the imagination and instill a love of learning in the silence of night i have often wished for just a few words of love from one man rather than the applause of thousands of people music is love love is music music is life and i love my life thank you and good night the ultimate lesson all of us have to learn is unconditional love which includes not only others but ourselves as well love isnt an emotion or an instinct  its an art my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an african name barack or blessed believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success love a temporary insanity curable by marriage hate is only a form love that hasnt found a way to express itself logically i met in the street a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat worn his cloak was out at the elbows the water passed through his shoes  and the stars through his soul enlightened leadership is spiritual if we understand spirituality not as some kind of religious dogma or ideology but as the domain of awareness where we experience values like truth goodness beauty love and compassion and also intuition creativity insight and focused attention no one is a friend to his friend who does not love in return true love comes quietly without banners or flashing lights if you hear bells get your ears checked it is not love that should be depicted as blind but selflove nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love i will not be just a tourist in the world of images just watching images passing by which i cannot live in make love to possess as permanent sources of joy and ecstasy i love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station through which god speaks to us every hour if we will only tune in i like america just as everybody else does i love america i gotta say that but america will be judged may we not succumb to thoughts of violence and revenge today but rather to thoughts of mercy and compassion we are to love our enemies that they might be returned to their right minds for true love is inexhaustible the more you give the more you have and if you go to draw at the true fountainhead the more water you draw the more abundant is its flow were not raising children with the love that we need to there is something in the unselfish and selfsacrificing love of a brute which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man what i needed most was to love and to be loved eager to be caught happily i wrapped those painful bonds around me and sure enough i would be lashed with the redhot pokers or jealousy by suspicions and fear by burst of anger and quarrels love is the ultimate theme but its not just for women it is impossible to love and to be wise my number one goal is to love support and be there for my son food love career and mothers the four major guilt groups there is no friendship no love like that of the parent for the child i never knew how to worship until i knew how to love the essential elements of giving are power and love  activity and affection  and the consciousness of the race testifies that in the high and appropriate exercise of these is a blessedness greater than any other i love being black in america and especially being black in hollywood love seeks one thing only the good of the one loved it leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves love therefore is its own reward there is only one secure foundation a genuine deep relationship with jesus christ which will carry you through any and all turmoil no matter what storms are raging all around youll stand firm if you stand on his love if you love someone you say it right then out loud otherwise the moment just passes you by its tangible its solid its beautiful its artistic from my standpoint and i just love real estate love can consign us to hell or to paradise but it always takes us somewhere if you find someone you love in your life then hang on to that love thank you god for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough those who intend on becoming great should love neither themselves nor their own things but only what is just whether it happens to be done by themselves or others disneyland is a work of love we didnt go into disneyland just with the idea of making money i love it when someone insults me that means that i dont have to be nice anymore any fool knows that bravado is always a coverup for insecurity thats the truth and on that note ill say goodnight god love you look your best  who said love is blind the greatest pleasure of life is love love implies anger the man who is angered by nothing cares about nothing believe in love believe in magic hell believe in santa clause believe in others believe in yourself believe in your dreams if you dont who will i love producing i am loving doing that i think that is my most natural space in the business i just love producing or editing and thats where i thrive i believe in an america where millions of americans believe in an america thats the america millions of americans believe in thats the america i love girls we love for what they are young men for what they promise to be i love women but i feel like you cant trust some of them some of them are liars you know like i was in the park and i met this girl she was cute and she had a dog and i went up to her we started talking she told me her dogs name then i said does he bite she said no and i said oh yeah then how does he eat liar if having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude then animals are better off than a lot of humans there are more love songs than anything else if songs could make you do something wed all love one another americans love to fight all real americans love the sting of battle love feels no burden thinks nothing of trouble attempts what is above its strength pleads no excuse of impossibility for it thinks all things lawful for itself and all things possible young love is a flame very pretty often very hot and fierce but still only light and flickering the love of the older and disciplined heart is as coals deepburning unquenchable im in trouble because im normal and slightly arrogant a lot of people dont like themselves and i happen to be totally in love with myself the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge what i know is is that if you do work that you love and the work fulfills you the rest will come some white people hate black people and some white people love black people some black people hate white people and some black people love white people so you see its not an issue of black and white its an issue of lovers and haters i love romance im a sucker for it i love it so much its pathetic start living now stop saving the good china for that special occasion stop withholding your love until that special person materializes every day you are alive is a special occasion every minute every breath is a gift from god im not saying that love always takes you to heaven your life can become a nightmare but that said it is worth taking the risk what i cannot love i overlook is that real friendship i love argument i love debate i dont expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me thats not their job ask those who love him with a sincere love and they will tell you that they find no greater or prompter relief amid the troubles of their life than in loving conversation with their divine friend love does not claim possession but gives freedom love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness whoever loves becomes humble those who love have so to speak pawned a part of their narcissism if love does not know how to give and take without restrictions it is not love but a transaction that never fails to lay stress on a plus and a minus acceptance is not love you love a person because he or she has lovable traits but you accept everybody just because theyre alive and human and i ask why am i black they say i was born in sin and shamed inequity one of the main songs we used to sing in church makes me sick love wash me and i shall be whiter than snow love has features which pierce all hearts he wears a bandage which conceals the faults of those beloved he has wings he comes quickly and flies away the same well love is insanity the ancient greeks knew that it is the taking over of a rational and lucid mind by delusion and selfdestruction you lose yourself you have no power over yourself you cant even think straight i love you the more in that i believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else true love stories never have endings its good for everyone to understand that they are to love their enemies simply because your enemies show you things about yourself you need to change so in actuality enemies are friends in reverse faith is love taking the form of aspiration i always like to win but im the big sister i want to make sure she has everything even if i dont have anything its hard i love her too much thats what counts behold my friends the spring is come the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun and we shall soon see the results of their love a bells not a bell til you ring it a songs not a song til you sing it love in your heart wasnt put there to stay love isnt love til you give it away it is not the creation of wealth that is wrong but the love of money for its own sake depression is when you have lots of love but no ones taking i think what motivates people is not great hate but great love for other people we cant form our children on our own concepts we must take them and love them as god gives them to us treasure the love you receive above all it will survive long after your good health has vanished you should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit its one of the major happinesses and so much more lasting than love so much less costly in emotional wear and tear all men and women have an equal need for love when these needs are not fulfilled it is easy to have our feelings hurt for which we blame our partner i love my family very much i wish i could see them a little more often than i do but we understand because were a show business family and we all work we do not judge the people we love love cannot endure indifference it needs to be wanted like a lamp it needs to be fed out of the oil of anothers heart or its flame burns low trust in what you love continue to do it and it will take you where you need to go for love would be love of the wrong thing there is yet faith but the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting grief is the price we pay for love i love blackjack but im not addicted to gambling im addicted to sitting in a semi circle i love everything thats old  old friends old times old manners old books old wine he that is jealous is not in love the hardest people to reach with the love of god are not the bad people they know they are bad they have no defense the hardest ones to win for god are the selfrighteous people but when women are moved and lend help when women who are by nature calm and controlled give encouragement and applause when virtuous and knowledgeable women grace the endeavor with their sweet love then it is invincible if a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment or an enlarged egotism love has its place as does hate peace has its place as does war mercy has its place as do cruelty and revenge you can never control who you fall in love with even when youre in the most sad confused time of your life you dont fall in love with people because theyre fun it just happens i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing my mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all  the gift of unconditional love they cared deeply about who we would be and much less about what we would do i do not want a husband who honours me as a queen if he does not love me as a woman women have simple tastes they get pleasure out of the conversation of children in arms and men in love love is a trap when it appears we see only its light not its shadows i do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success such emotions make a man forget food sleep friends love everything i cant imagine anything more worthwhile than doing what i most love and they pay me for it if you love those who love you what credit is that to you for even sinners love those who love them and if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you for even sinners do the same there is only one happiness in this life to love and be loved it is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults so to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him and to speak painful truth through loving words that is friendship it is not love that is blind but jealousy romantic love is mental illness but its a pleasurable one its a drug it distorts reality and thats the point of it it would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate authenticity is the alignment of head mouth heart and feet  thinking saying feeling and doing the same thing  consistently this builds trust and followers love leaders they can trust the truth is i love being alive and i love feeling free so if i cant have those things then i feel like a caged animal and id rather not be in a cage id rather be dead and its real simple and i think its not that uncommon the opposite of love is not hate its indifference and a special thank you to the citizens of massachusetts you are paying all the taxes creating all the jobs raising all the children this government is yours thank you for letting me serve you i love this job the most important thing in the world is family and love love is the most important thing in the world hate we should remove from the dictionary love is moral even without legal marriage but marriage is immoral without love among those whom i like or admire i can find no common denominator but among those whom i love i can all of them make me laugh one cannot think well love well sleep well if one has not dined well accept that all of us can be hurt that all of us can and surely will at times fail other vulnerabilities like being embarrassed or risking love can be terrifying too i think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk all brave men love for he only is brave who has affections to fight for whether in the daily battle of life or in physical contests i am not a vegetarian because i love animals i am a vegetarian because i hate plants how i love lucy was born we decided that instead of divorce lawyers profiting from our mistakes wed profit from them love is the answer to everything its the only reason to do anything if you dont write stories you love youll never make it if you dont write stories that other people love youll never make it computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams but no machine can replace the human spark of spirit compassion love and understanding the more i think about it the more i realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion her intelligence reflected in my daughters love like a chicken salad or restaurant hash must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor so long as we love we serve so long as we are loved by others i should say that we are almost indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend true love is eternal infinite and always like itself it is equal and pure without violent demonstrations it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart music is what i breath what i love to do it keeps me alive passion is momentary love is enduring to fall in love is easy even to remain in it is not difficult our human loneliness is cause enough but it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be as much as i would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time that doesnt work for me id just rather sit at home and read or go out to dinner with someone or talk to someone i love or talk to somebody that makes me laugh this is love to fly toward a secret sky to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment first to let go of life finally to take a step without feet i love you more than my own skin first and last what is demanded of genius is love of truth we cannot fashion our children after our desires we must have them and love them as god has given them to us to be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia  to mistake an ordinary young woman for a goddess i love to put on lotion sometimes ill watch tv and go into a lotion trance for an hour i try to find brands that dont taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me prayer does not use up artificial energy doesnt burn up any fossil fuel doesnt pollute neither does song neither does love neither does the dance i love wagner but the music i prefer is that of a cat hung up by its tail outside a window and trying to stick to the panes of glass with its claws love can do much but duty more about all you can do in life is be who you are some people will love you for you most will love you for what you can do for them and some wont like you at all love consists in giving without getting in return in giving what is not owed what is not due the other thats why true love is never based as associations for utility or pleasure are on a fair exchange i have a love interest in every one of my films a gun there is no time for cutanddried monotony there is time for work and time for love that leaves no other time i dont know if i believe in love at first sight but of course i believe in two people having chemistry right away a girl should be really easy to talk to when i lose track of time because weve been talking i think thats really fun if there is such a thing as a good marriage it is because it resembles friendship rather than love there are fathers who do not love their children there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson sex is a part of love you shouldnt go around doing it unless you are in love when i see children i see the face of god thats why i love them so much thats what i see in art as in love instinct is enough love always involves responsibility and love always involves sacrifice and we do not really love christ unless we are prepared to face his task and to take up his cross listen to your innervoice surround yourself with loving nurturing people fall in love with your art and find yourself music is the great communicator everything that i love is behind those gates we have elephants and giraffes and crocodiles and every kind of tigers and lions and  and we have bus loads of kids who dont get to see those things they come up sick children and enjoy it love him and let him love you do you think anything else under heaven really matters a lot of women dont know how to love because theres deep reasons for them not knowing how to love and what i mean by deep reasons is deep and dark reasons romantic love is an illusion most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames only the really plain people know about love  the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents the more one does and sees and feels the more one is able to do and the more genuine may be ones appreciation of fundamental things like home and love and understanding companionship what i am is how i came out no ones perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself a man always remembers his first love with special tenderness but after that he begins to bunch them marriage is not a noun its a verb it isnt something you get its something you do its the way you love your partner every day i love cats because i enjoy my home and little by little they become its visible soul there is a courtesy of the heart it is allied to love from its springs the purest courtesy in the outward behavior if one is desperate for love i suggest looking at ones friends and family and see if love is all around if not get a new set of friends a new family all married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love good battle is objective and honest  never vicious or cruel good battle is healthy and constructive and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership basketball is my passion i love it but my family and friends mean everything to me thats whats important i need my phone so i can keep in contact with them at all times the first symptom of love in a young man is timidity in a girl boldness if jesus was here do you think jesus would show me any love do you think jesus would love me ive only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror a poet is before anything else a person who is passionately in love with language i just want to do what i do best and thats fight i love it however rare true love may be it is less so than true friendship the body is a house of many windows there we all sit showing ourselves and crying on the passersby to come and love us alcohol is like love the first kiss is magic the second is intimate the third is routine after that you take the girls clothes off it is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us but not impossible that it may respect or sympathize so a man would rather leave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face love seeketh not itself to please nor for itself hath any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven in hells despair adultery is the application of democracy to love friendship at first sight like love at first sight is said to be the only truth when you start falling for somebody and you cant stop thinking about when youre going to see them again i love that women are beautiful they deserve to be cherished and respected the bee gees who are brilliant i just love great music i feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people im a romantic and we romantics are more sensitive to the way people feel we love more and we hurt more when were hurt we hurt for a long time what ive enjoyed most though is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them good food is a global thing and i find that there is always something new and amazing to learn  i love it love is the delightful interval between meeting a beautiful girl and discovering that she looks like a haddock i love bringing roses to a woman when she least expects it dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved i love power but it is as an artist that i love it i love it as a musician loves his violin to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies all happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love i might get drunk one day and fall in love or fall over a hooker outside and i would have consummated a relationship that i couldnt necessarily believe in love and work work and love thats all there is ill come and make love to you at five oclock if im late start without me love is what we were born with fear is what we learned here it sounds like a cliche but i also learnt that youre not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are love is an emotion that is based on an opinion of women that is impossible for those who have had any experience with them life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us oh be swift to love make haste to be kind if you have love in your life it can make up for a great many things that are missing if you dont have love in your life no matter what else there is its not enough ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society unless you love someone nothing else makes any sense i think careful cooking is love dont you the loveliest thing you can cook for someone whos close to you is about as nice a valentine as you can give above our life we love a steadfast friend mothers are the people who love us for no good reason and those of us who are mothers know its the most exquisite love of all ive told billy if i ever caught him cheating i wouldnt kill him because i love his children and they need a dad but i would beat him up i know where all of his sports injuries are the distinction between children and adults while probably useful for some purposes is at bottom a specious one i feel there are only individual egos crazy for love first love is first love first marriage is first marriage disappointment is disappointment so fall asleep love loved by me for i know love i am loved by thee the three hardest tasks in the world are neither physical feats nor intellectual achievements but moral acts to return love for hate to include the excluded and to say i was wrong well love you just the way you are if youre perfect if were destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff theres got to be a very powerful energy to fight that i think we need more love in the world we need more kindness more compassion more joy more laughter i definitely want to contribute to that we dont believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack from your parents you learn love and laughter and how to put one foot before the other but when books are opened you discover that you have wings smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women a test of a people is how it behaves toward the old it is easy to love children even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children but the affection and care for the old the incurable the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture falling out of love is chiefly a matter of forgetting how charming someone is our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better a flower falls even though we love it and a weed grows even though we do not love it chemistry can be a good and bad thing chemistry is good when you make love with it chemistry is bad when you make crack with it when you are older you will understand how precious little things seemingly of no value in themselves can be loved and prized above all price when they convey the love and thoughtfulness of a good heart if you dont love me it does not matter anyway i can love for both of us i love my family and i miss them very much but im a new person now i know a lot of people will not agree with what ive done but it was right for me you dont have to love them you just have to respect their rights the love of a mother is the veil of a softer light between the heart and the heavenly father people love westerns worldwide theres something fantasylike about an individual fighting the elements or even bad guys and the elements its a simpler time theres no organized laws and stuff true love doesnt come to you it has to be inside you even though i love solar and love wind like most people do i like the renewable sources they alone are not going to get america energy independent this is the america that i love this is a great people we can do anything we can achieve anything weve got a government that has gotten in the way of the american people were going to change that in november a man without ambition is dead a man with ambition but no love is dead a man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it love is a portion of the soul itself and it is of the same nature as the celestial breathing of the atmosphere of paradise black as the devil hot as hell pure as an angel sweet as love and i love that even in the toughest moments when were all sweating it  when were worried that the bill wont pass and it seems like all is lost  barack never lets himself get distracted by the chatter and the noise just like his grandmother he just keeps getting up and moving forward with patience and wisdom and courage and grace love never dies of starvation but often of indigestion love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain it there is nothing i love as much as a good fight just dont give up trying to do what you really want to do where there is love and inspiration i dont think you can go wrong everyone got kind of crazy with me mentioning i was in love with a woman there is a fountain of youth it is your mind your talents the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love when you learn to tap this source you will truly have defeated age the highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy but a love of ones country deep enough to call her to a higher plain in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make love is an attempt at penetrating another being but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual people everywhere love windows love is easy and i love writing you cant resist love you get an idea someone says something and youre in love act happy feel happy be happy without a reason in the world then you can love and do what you will i love you and because i love you i would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies if youre lucky enough to have a pretty girl love you and share herself and sleep with you make that your secret the best way to spoil love is by talking to too many people about it i tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth  and truth rewarded me i say to people who care for people who are dying if you really love that person and want to help them be with them when their end comes close sit with them  you dont even have to talk you dont have to do anything but really be there with them at best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love but it is also all too often where we learn nasty things like hate rage and shame true love cannot be found where it does not exist nor can it be denied where it does if thou desire the love of god and man be humble for the proud heart as it loves none but itself is beloved of none but itself humility enforces where neither virtue nor strength nor reason can prevail no woman ever hates a man for being in love with her but many a woman hate a man for being a friend to her to live in this world you must be able to do three things to love what is mortal to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it and when the time comes to let it go to let it go there isnt any formula or method you learn to love by loving  by paying attention and doing what one thereby discovers has to be done age does not protect you from love but love to some extent protects you from age the planter the farmer the mechanic and the laborer form the great body of the people of the united states they are the bone and sinew of the country men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws you dont walk away if you love someone you help the person love is union with somebody or something outside oneself under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of ones own self where love rules there is no will to power and where power predominates there love is lacking the one is the shadow of the other if one of two lovers is loyal and the other jealous and false how may their friendship last for love is slain those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body in our minds love and lust are really separated its hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with and isnt afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe why love if losing hurts so much i have no answers anymore only the life i have lived the pain now is part of the happiness then i love to hit people i love to im getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because i just cant stop lifting it and i love that you know we abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us when we see land as a community to which we belong we may begin to use it with love and respect i usually get myself into situations that cause sparks i mean im a girl that likes the storms i love feeling alive i love walking out in the cold in my bare feet and feeling the ice on my toes it is with an old love as it is with old age a man lives to all the miseries but is dead to all the pleasures there is hardly any activity any enterprise which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations and yet which fails so regularly as love it is not in the power of even the most crafty dissimulation to conceal love long where it really is nor to counterfeit it long where it is not love and kindness are never wasted they always make a difference they bless the one who receives them and they bless you the giver it is a great consolation for me to remember that the lord to whom i had drawn near in humble and childlike faith has suffered and died for me and that he will look on me in love and compassion the impulse to cruelty is in many people almost as violent as the impulse to sexual love  almost as violent and much more mischievous i love the name of honor more than i fear death love is friendship set on fire you are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you theyre right to think that about me because im the person most likely to sleep with my female fans i genuinely love other women and i think they know that a wedding anniversary is the celebration of love trust partnership tolerance and tenacity the order varies for any given year the only thing we never get enough of is love and the only thing we never give enough of is love love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect considering their value on the personality market you know all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy everything else is just sprinkles on the sundae nobody loves a woman because she is handsome or ugly stupid or intelligent we love because we love everyone can relate to love hurt pain learning how to forgive needing to get over needing the power of god in their life i have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion  i have shuddered at it i shudder no more  i could be martyred for my religion  love is my religion  i could die for that when i sing i feel like when youre first in love its more than sex its that point two people can get to they call love when you really touch someone for the first time but its gigantic multiplied by the whole audience i feel chills a woman has two smiles that an angel might envy the smile that accepts a lover before words are uttered and the smile that lights on the first born babe and assures it of a mothers love a lot of times black folks look for love in all the wrong places youre always looking for somebody to love you be accepted and theres the insecurities that are even transmitted through rap everyone is trying to aim to please too much men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear i think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved i know that i can give love for a minute for half an hour for a day for a month but i can give i am very happy to do that i want to do that the love of learning the sequestered nooks and all the sweet serenity of books dont threaten me with love baby lets just go walking in the rain men often pass from love to ambition but they seldom come back again from ambition to love if you cannot inspire a woman with love of you fill her above the brim with love of herself all that runs over will be yours i understand now that the vulnerability ive always felt is the greatest strength a person can have you cant experience life without feeling life what ive learned is that being vulnerable to somebody you love is not a weakness its a strength if a man is truly in love the most beautiful woman in the world couldnt take him away maybe for a few days but not forever if i think more about death than some other people it is probably because i love life more than they do love is the river of life in the world the love that lasts longest is the love that is never returned i love quotations because it is a joy to find thoughts one might have beautifully expressed with much authority by someone recognized wiser than oneself if so many men so many minds certainly so many hearts so many kinds of love love is anterior to life posterior to death initial of creation and the exponent of breath tell the truth sing with passion work with laughter love with heart cause thats all that matters in the end getting divorced just because you dont love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do give a little love to a child and you get a great deal back it is with true love as it is with ghosts everyone talks about it but few have seen it he who knows no hardships will know no hardihood he who faces no calamity will need no courage mysterious though it is the characteristics in human nature which we love best grow in a soil with a strong mixture of troubles love is never defeated and i could add the history of ireland proves it i love chicken i would eat chicken fingers on thanksgiving if it were socially acceptable in friendship as well as love ignorance very often contributes more to our happiness than knowledge neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius love love love that is the soul of genius the motto of chivalry is also the motto of wisdom to serve all but love only one when we ask for love we dont ask others to be fair to usbut rather to care for us to be considerate of us there is a world of difference here between demanding justice and begging or pleading for love he who does not love his own language is worse than an animal and smelly fish the secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person you know theyre right if you love to be with them all the time we always love those who admire us but we do not always love those whom we admire when people are lame they love to blame when youre taught to love everyone to love your enemies then what value does that place on love a james cagney love scene is one where he lets the other guy live we are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us more than we wish if love is the treasure laughter is the key i am deeply grateful to the citizens of sarajevo and the sarajevo canton assembly for bestowing upon me this incredible honor of citizenship i am so proud to now be a part of such an extraordinary part of the world and fellow citizen to the people i deeply love and admire you will reciprocally promise love loyalty and matrimonial honesty we only want for you this day that these words constitute the principle of your entire life and that with the help of divine grace you will observe these solemn vows that today before god you formulate my trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life is what keeps me moving forward if you love something let it go free if it doesnt come back you never had it if it comes back love it forever i love my children beyond all reason theyre my joy even when theyre wild with kid energy we may sooner be brought to love them that hate us than them that love us more than we would have them do little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between love and duty love has its own time its own season and its own reasons from coming and going you cannot bribe it or coerce it or reason it into staying you can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you love does not alter the beloved it alters itself we pardon to the extent that we love this love is silent to love someone means to see him as god intended him love can no more continue without a constant motion than fire can and when once you take hope and fear away you take from it its very life and being let us be about setting high standards for life love creativity and wisdom if our expectations in these areas are low we are not likely to experience wellness setting high standards makes every day and every decade worth looking forward to art is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon when we love a woman we dont start measuring her limbs just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other to let their souls blend in a soft whisper so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can as it were creep into god romance is tempestuous love is calm where love is concerned too much is not even enough i really love idiot enlightened characters  these characters who fail to engage with the drama of their immediate circumstances they fail to be reactive and enrolled by drama as it happens around them this is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love the more they give the more they possess the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death a religious man is a person who holds god and man in one thought at one time at all times who suffers harm done to others whose greatest passion is compassion whose greatest strength is love and defiance of despair i did not just fall in love i made a parachute jump metaphors are dangerous love begins with a metaphor which is to say love begins at the point when a woman enters her first word into our poetic memory at the end of the day you know love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish even if a unity of faith is not possible a unity of love is
