only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power we have guided missiles and misguided men science investigates religion interprets science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong bad times have a scientific value these are occasions a good learner would not miss science does not know its debt to imagination men love to wonder and that is the seed of science the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom aerodynamically the bumble bee shouldnt be able to fly but the bumble bee doesnt know it so it goes on flying anyway science never solves a problem without creating ten more a scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it the most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds new discoveries is not eureka but thats funny science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life the best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance  the idea that anything is possible touch a scientist and you touch a child we are born at a given moment in a given place and like vintage years of wine we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born astrology does not lay claim to anything more research is what im doing when i dont know what im doing each problem that i solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems your theory is crazy but its not crazy enough to be true anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words ye must have faith anthropology demands the openmindedness with which one must look and listen record in astonishment and wonder that which one would not have been able to guess there is a single light of science and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere if a mans wit be wandering let him study the mathematics a fact is a simple statement that everyone believes it is innocent unless found guilty a hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe it is guilty until found effective science is simply common sense at its best that is rigidly accurate in observation and merciless to fallacy in logic science knows no country because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence the great tragedy of science  the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact the scientific theory i like best is that the rings of saturn are composed entirely of lost airline luggage science is the father of knowledge but opinion breeds ignorance it is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast it keeps him young science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition the fewer the facts the stronger the opinion what is a scientist after all it is a curious man looking through a keyhole the keyhole of nature trying to know whats going on science is organized common sense where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact i see nothing in space as promising as the view from a ferris wheel few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even to hope by a limit imposed from without but falsely identified as lying within adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery and you lose for certain and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer your approach to this certainty i believe in general in a dualism between facts and the ideas of those facts in human heads every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination for nasa space is still a high priority i hate facts i always say the chief end of man is to form general propositions  adding that no general proposition is worth a damn science is a firstrate piece of furniture for a mans upper chamber if he has common sense on the ground floor if an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right but if he says that it is impossible he is very probably wrong inanimate objects can be classified scientifically into three major categories those that dont work those that break down and those that get lost you cannot feed the hungry on statistics science and technology revolutionize our lives but memory tradition and myth frame our response i am not a scientist i am rather an impresario of scientists the nineteenth century believed in science but the twentieth century does not a year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in god the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success we seem to have a compulsion these days to bury time capsules in order to give those people living in the next century or so some idea of what we are like the folly of mistaking a paradox for a discovery a metaphor for a proof a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths and oneself for an oracle is inborn in us in science fact can only mean confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent i suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms we can lick gravity but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming there are no shortcuts in evolution science is wonderfully equipped to answer the question how but it gets terribly confused when you ask the question why when i find myself in the company of scientists i feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light they say forgetful of the shadows speed nobody climbs mountains for scientific reasons science is used to raise money for the expeditions but you really climb for the hell of it all science requires mathematics the knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us this is the easiest of sciences a fact which is obvious in that no ones brain rejects it for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon from now on we live in a world where man has walked on the moon its not a miracle we just decided to go science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being men the doctor has been taught to be interested not in health but in disease what the public is taught is that health is the cure for disease people think of the inventor as a screwball but no one ever asks the inventor what he thinks of other people it will free man from the remaining chains the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is of course living in a state of sin facts are the air of scientists without them you can never fly scientific theory is a contrived foothold in the chaos of living phenomena the science of today is the technology of tomorrow the cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from science along with behaviour control genetic engineering transplanted heads computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance it accumulates in the form of inert facts bush reiterated his stand to conservatives opposing his decision on stem cell research he said today he believes life begins at conception and ends at execution he is so old that his blood type was discontinued take young researchers put them together in virtual seclusion give them an unprecedented degree of freedom and turn up the pressure by fostering competitiveness a satellite has no conscience in all science error precedes the truth and it is better it should go first than last if we wish to make a new world we have the material ready the first one too was made out of chaos there is one thing even more vital to science than intelligent methods and that is the sincere desire to find out the truth whatever it may be the radical novelty of modern science lies precisely in the rejection of the belief that the forces which move the stars and atoms are contingent upon the preferences of the human heart the scientist is motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire for truth when i investigate and when i discover that the forces of the heavens and the planets are within ourselves then truly i seem to be living among the gods the next major explosion is going to be when genetics and computers come together im talking about an organic computer  about biological substances that can function like a semiconductor some dreamers demand that scientists only discover things that can be used for good sadly embryonic stem cell research is completely legal in this country and has been going on at universities and research facilities for years scientists worldwide agree that the reduction needed to stabilize the climate is actually more like 80 percent polygraph tests are 20thcentury witchcraft anthropology was the science that gave her the platform from which she surveyed scolded and beamed at the world half of the modern drugs could well be thrown out of the window except that the birds might eat them leave the atom alone whenever anyone says theoretically they really mean not really there was no before the beginning of our universe because once upon a time there was no time science without religion is lame religion without science is blind the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and science to raise new questions new possibilities to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it the grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple and may as a rule be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking the man of science is a poor philosopher it stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome mans insecurity before himself and before nature science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all  the apathy of human beings success is a science if you have the conditions you get the result a fools brain digests philosophy into folly science into superstition and art into pedantry hence university education romance should never begin with sentiment it should begin with science and end with a settlement let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors together let us explore the stars conquer the deserts eradicate disease tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody before it was actually verified we have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology this is a prescription for disaster we might get away with it for a while but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces im concentrating on staying healthy having peace being happy remembering what is important taking in nature and animals spending time reading trying to understand the universe where science and the spiritual meet if civilization is to survive we must cultivate the science of human relationships  the ability of all peoples of all kinds to live together in the same world at peace therefore the good of man must be the end of the science of politics we live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge it is those who know little and not those who know much who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science art is the beautiful way of doing things science is the effective way of doing things business is the economic way of doing things imagination is the key to my lyrics the rest is painted with a little science fiction the church saves sinners but science seeks to stop their manufacture there will one day spring from the brain of science a machine or force so fearful in its potentialities so absolutely terrifying that even man the fighter who will dare torture and death in order to inflict torture and death will be appalled and so abandon war forever democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage germany has reduced savagery to a science and this great war for the victorious peace of justice must go on until the german cancer is cut clean out of the world body science can purify religion from error and superstition religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes the greatest advances of civilization whether in architecture or painting in science and literature in industry or agriculture have never come from centralized government wisdom alone is the science of other sciences science is nothing but perception part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because were hardwired not to always think clearly when were scared and the countrys scared he who possesses art and science has religion he who does not possess them needs religion english is necessary as at present original works of science are in english i believe that in two decades times original works of science will start coming out in our languages then we can move over like the japanese the whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner but that they reflect a certain underlying order which may or may not be divinely inspired there is no way that writers can be tamed and rendered civilized or even cured the only solution known to science is to provide the patient with an isolation room where he can endure the acute stages in private and where food can be poked in to him with a stick individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today  but the core of science fiction its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all skeptical scrutiny is the means in both science and religion by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense science arose from poetry when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends the credit of advancing science has always been due to individuals and never to the age the difference between science and the fuzzy subjects is that science requires reasoning while those other subjects merely require scholarship one could write a history of science in reverse by assembling the solemn pronouncements of highest authority about what could not be done and could never happen he who would do good to another must do it in minute particulars general good is the plea of the scoundrel hypocrite and flatterer for art and science cannot exist but in minutely organized particulars i am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students if we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us that we are the reason there is a universe does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines when i die im leaving my body to science fiction science is what you know philosophy is what you dont know it has become almost a cliche to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics science has explained nothing the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness i have seen firsthand that agricultural science has enormous potential to increase the yields of small farmers and lift them out of hunger and poverty every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable as those by which the universe is regulated and governed man cannot make principles he can only discover them theology is a science of mind applied to god false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science for they often endure long but false views if supported by some evidence do little harm for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness the capacity to be puzzled is the premise of all creation be it in art or in science specialized meaninglessness has come to be regarded in certain circles as a kind of hallmark of true science we want to answer this classical question who am i so i think that most of our works are for art or whatever we do including science or religion tried to answer that question the god whom science recognizes must be a god of universal laws exclusively a god who does a wholesale not a retail business he cannot accommodate his processes to the convenience of individuals man lives for science as well as bread shun no toil to make yourself remarkable by some talent or other yet do not devote yourself to one branch exclusively strive to get clear notions about all give up no science entirely for science is but one science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesnt exist yet but soon will and will change everything for everybody and nothing will ever be the same again as soon as you have an idea that changes some small part of the world you are writing science fiction it is always the art of the possible never the impossible the fundamental concept in social science is power in the same sense in which energy is the fundamental concept in physics the march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people it often means the opposite weve arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology i do not believe in god his existence has been disproved by science but in the concentration camp i learned to believe in men science is global einsteins equation emc2 has to reach everywhere science is a beautiful gift to humanity we should not distort it science does not differentiate between multiple races life is not an exact science it is an art science is organized knowledge wisdom is organized life time travel used to be thought of as just science fiction but einsteins general theory of relativity allows for the possibility that we could warp spacetime so much that you could go off in a rocket and return before you set out the product of mental labor  science  always stands far below its value because the labortime necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labortime required for its original production science must have originated in the feeling that something was wrong this world after all our science and sciences is still a miracle wonderful inscrutable magical and more to whosoever will think of it as long as men are free to ask what they must free to say what they think free to think what they will freedom can never be lost and science can never regress almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attributable to science which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century art is the tree of life science is the tree of death natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science there will be one science science in the modern world has many uses its chief use however is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich i am one of those scientists who feels that it is no longer enough just to get on and do science we have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance vanity of science knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science the enlightenment is under threat so is reason so is truth so is science especially in the schools of america it vexes me when they would constrain science by the authority of the scriptures and yet do not consider themselves bound to answer reason and experiment the usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe why does the universe go to all the bother of existing in questions of science the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual science has not yet mastered prophecy we predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10 science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness the foundation of empire is art and science remove them or degrade them and the empire is no more empire follows art and not vice versa as englishmen suppose politics is a science you can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong the pursuit of science leads only to the insoluble science is properly more scrupulous than dogma dogma gives a charter to mistake but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake and must keep the conscience alive science is not only a disciple of reason but also one of romance and passion blind faith no matter how passionately expressed will not suffice science for its part will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition when youre thirsty and it seems that you could drink the entire ocean thats faith when you start to drink and finish only a glass or two thats science science fiction writers foresee the inevitable and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable solutions are not political liberty the peace of a nation and science itself are gifts for which fate demands a heavy tax in blood the universe is governed by science but science tells us that we cant solve the equations directly in the abstract science is but an image of the truth science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature and that is because in the last analysis we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve science my lad is made up of mistakes but they are mistakes which it is useful to make because they lead little by little to the truth of course in science there are things that are open to doubt and things need to be discussed but among the things that science does know evolution is about as certain as anything we know the work of science is to substitute facts for appearances and demonstrations for impressions to me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science political ideology can corrupt the mind and science science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing it is a matter of chance which we are in the capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius of erudition and of science philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science particularly physics the media need superheroes in science just as in every sphere of life but there is really a continuous range of abilities with no clear dividing line i used to think information was destroyed in black hole this was my biggest blunder or at least my biggest blunder in science the athanasian creed is to me light and intelligible reading in comparison with much that now passes for science poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars  mere globs of gas atoms i too can see the stars on a desert night and feel them but do i see less or more a science which does not bring us nearer to god is worthless but perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation the wonder of science scientific ways of thinking and the history of scientific ideas rather than laboratory experience we especially need imagination in science it is not all mathematics nor all logic but it is somewhat beauty and poetry formerly when religion was strong and science weak men mistook magic for medicine now when science is strong and religion weak men mistake medicine for magic reason observation and experience the holy trinity of science science coverage could be improved by the recognition that science is timeless and therefore science stories should not need to be pegged to an item in the news science commits suicide when it adopts a creed by any reasonable measure of achievement the faith of the enlightenment thinkers in science was justified if we take science as our sole guide if we accept and hold fast that alone which is verifiable the old theology must go it seems to me that socialists today can preserve their position in academic economics merely by the pretense that the differences are entirely moral questions about which science cannot decide books are the carriers of civilization without books history is silent literature dumb science crippled thought and speculation at a standstill science has done more for the development of western civilization in one hundred years than christianity did in eighteen hundred years mild autism can give you a genius like einstein if you have severe autism you could remain nonverbal you dont want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum but if you got rid of all the autism genetics you wouldnt have science or art all you would have is a bunch of social yak yaks when i look upon seamen men of science and philosophers man is the wisest of all beings when i look upon priests and prophets nothing is as contemptible as man one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit the wealthy are always surrounded by hangerson science and art are as well healing papa would tell me is not a science but the intuitive art of wooing nature in science one tries to tell people in such a way as to be understood by everyone something that no one ever knew before but in poetry its the exact opposite science is nothing but trained and organized common sense books are the money of literature but only the counters of science if history and science have taught us anything it is that passion and desire are not the same as truth borrowing knowledge of reality from all sources taking the best from every study science of mind brings together the highest enlightenment of the ages moral science is better occupied when treating of friendship than of justice the method of political science is the interpretation of life its instrument is insight a nice understanding of subtle unformulated conditions logic is neither an art nor a science but a dodge the man of science has learned to believe in justification not by faith but by verification science has fulfilled her function when she has ascertained and enunciated truth science reckons many prophets but there is not even a promise of a messiah science and literature are not two things but two sides of one thing ecclesiasticism in science is only unfaithfulness to truth in science as in art and as i believe in every other sphere of human activity there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors but it is only in one or two of them no delusion is greater than the notion that method and industry can make up for lack of motherwit either in science or in practical life education has failed in a very serious way to convey the most important lesson science can teach skepticism science and religion are the two most powerful forces in the world having them at odds is not productive the conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that people who investigate heresies must be heretics just as if a doctor who studies leprosy must be a leper indeed it is only recently that science has been allowed to study anything without reproach there are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man beyond history and beyond science the moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit art is science made clear everything is fraught with danger i love technology and i love science its just always all in the way you use it so theres no  you cant really blame anything on the technology its just the way people use it and it always has been there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity it is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition every science begins as philosophy and ends as art the science of the mind can only have for its proper goal the understanding of human nature by every human being and through its use brings peace to every human soul when science art literature and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible which can make a mans name live for thousands of years einstein was searching for string theory it not only reconciles general relativity to quantum mechanics but it reconciles science and the bible as well traditional science assumes for the most part that an objective observer independent reality exists the universe stars galaxies sun moon and earth would still be there if no one was looking we must revisit the idea that science is a methodology and not an ontology snow white is an old fairy tale so obviously the idea of vanity and obsession with youth is longstanding with todays science people have become crazy with trying to move their face around its bizarre science gives us knowledge but only philosophy can give us wisdom i dont read chick lit fantasy or science fiction but ill give any book a chance if its lying there and ive got half an hour to kill the world is full of strange phenomena that cannot be explained by the laws of logic or science dennis rodman is only one example a powerful attraction exists therefore to the promotion of a study and of duties of all others engrossing the time most completely and which is less benefited than most others by any acquaintance with science when push comes to shove it aint the science thats going to lift you upits the belief the spiritual side of life thats going to lift you up no matter what religion you are i like physics i think it is the best science out of all three of them because generally its more useful you learn about speed and velocity and time and thats all clever stuff ive lost my faith in science i want to be the cecil b demille of science fiction art has a double face of expression and illusion just like science has a double face the reality of error and the phantom of truth politics i conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself theres been some research in cognitive science im told that discloses that there have always been perhaps 10 to 15 percent of people who are as pascal puts it so made that they cannot believe to us when people talk about faith its white noise i had people in my life who didnt give up on me my mother my aunt my science teacher i had oneonone speech therapy i had a nanny who spent all day playing turntaking games with me advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science but an art medicine is not only a science it is also an art it does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life which must be understood before they may be guided in science we must be interested in things not in persons the mysteriousness and mystique of space is such that science fiction attempts to tantalize you by telling you a story that could possibly be out there and thats the appeal of science fiction thats the whole problem with science youve got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder medical science has proven time and again that when the resources are provided great progress in the treatment cure and prevention of disease can occur all ones inventions are true you can be sure of that poetry is as exact a science as geometry it is through science that we prove but through intuition that we discover man is unique not because he does science and his is unique not because he does art but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind ayurveda is a sister philosophy to yoga it is the science of life or longevity and it teaches about the power and the cycles of nature as well as the elements modern bodybuilding is ritual religion sport art and science awash in western chemistry and mathematics defying nature it surpasses it art and science have their meeting point in method in science read by preference the newest works in literature the oldest the classic literature is always modern it cannot be said often enough that science fiction as a genre is incredibly educational  and im speaking the written science fiction not star trek science fiction writers tend to fill their books if theyre clever with little bits of interesting stuff and real stuff i have seen the science i worshiped and the aircraft i loved destroying the civilization i expected them to serve the major obstacle to a religious renewal is the intellectual classes who are highly influential and tend to view religion as primitive superstition they believe that science has left atheism as the only respectable intellectual stance there is science logic reason there is thought verified by experience and then there is california medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability we have not given science too big a place in our education but we have made a perilous mistake in giving it too great a preponderance in method in every other branch of study i wasnt with joseph but i believe him my faith did not come to me through science and i will not permit socalled science to destroy it the most watched programme on the bbc after the news is probably doctor who what has happened is that science fiction has been subsumed into modern literature there are grandparents out there who speak klingon who are quite capable of holding down a job no one would think twice now about a parallel universe physics does not change the nature of the world it studies and no science of behavior can change the essential nature of man even though both sciences yield technologies with a vast power to manipulate the subject matters science is a differential equation religion is a boundary condition science is all metaphor i like science and i love gym oh and i like art but im really bad at it im just a terrible drawer i cant draw a circle even with a ruler i cant draw a straight line both the man of science and the man of action live always at the edge of mystery surrounded by it some day science may have the existence of mankind in power and the human race can commit suicide by blowing up the world politicians should read science fiction not westerns and detective stories freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts all good criticism should be judged the way art is you shouldnt read it the way you read history or science that which today calls itself science gives us more and more information and indigestible glut of information and less and less understanding man masters nature not by force but by understanding this is why science has succeeded where magic failed because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature strictly speaking the idea of a scientific poem is probably as nonsensical as that of a poetic science form your life humanly and you have done enough but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine biology is now bigger than physics as measured by the size of budgets by the size of the workforce or by the output of major discoveries and biology is likely to remain the biggest part of science through the twentyfirst century human nature is the only science of man and yet has been hitherto the most neglected society lives by faith and develops by science whence come i and whither go i that is the great unfathomable question the same for every one of us science has no answer to it man has to awaken to wonder  and so perhaps do peoples science is a way of sending him to sleep again after all science is essentially international and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it actually i majored in marketing and i have a bachelor of science though many have tried no one has ever yet explained away the decisive fact that science which can do so much cannot decide what it ought to do definition of statistics the science of producing unreliable facts from reliable figures god created the world the laws of nature were created by god true science tries to find out what god put in the world the trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they dont know what theyre talking about because they werent there they cant speculate about the origins of life because they werent there there are in fact two things science and opinion the former begets knowledge the later ignorance i did although i didnt read from page 1 to page 187 but i read chunks of it i did a little bit of science when i was in the university so i was able to understand the graphs and pie charts and stuff like that it was extremely dry science knows only one commandment  contribute to science for whatever reason i didnt succumb to the stereotype that science wasnt for girls i got encouragement from my parents i never ran into a teacher or a counselor who told me that science was for boys a lot of my friends did there are no such things as applied sciences only applications of science science means simply the aggregate of all the recipes that are always successful all the rest is literature president obama believes in a country where we invest in education in roads and bridges in science and in the future so we can create new opportunities so the next kid can make it big and the kid afer that and the kid after that thats what president obama believes go beyond science into the region of metaphysics real religion is beyond argument it can only be lived both inwardly and outwardly i think thats what distinguishes schmidt really in the movies now so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction and schmidt is simply human theres no melodrama theres no device its just about a human being however far modern science and techniques have fallen short of their inherent possibilities they have taught mankind at least one lesson nothing is impossible knowledge of the sciences is so much smoke apart from the heavenly science of christ science fiction writers i am sorry to say really do not know anything we cant talk about science because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial and usually our fiction is dreadful mythology and science both extend the scope of human beings like science and technology mythology as we shall see is not about opting out of this world but about enabling us to live more intensely within it economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life the result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scotfree and ignores the environmental cost making movies is not rocket science its about relationships and communication and strangers coming together to see if they can get along harmoniously productively and creatively thats a challenge when it works its fantastic and will lift you up when it doesnt work its almost just as fascinating evolution seems to close the heart to some of the plainest spiritual truths while it opens the mind to the wildest guesses advanced in the name of science space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time i warn you against believing that advertising is a science as soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise human science is at a loss everything in food is science the only subjective part is when you eat it the kitchens a laboratory and everything that happens there has to do with science its biology chemistry physics yes theres history yes theres artistry yes to all of that but what happened there what actually happens to the food is all science science without conscience is the death of the soul history is the science of things which are not repeated i also like to look at the dynamic that takes place between religion and science because in a way both are asking the same questions who are we where do we come from why are we here where are we going the methodologies are diametrically opposed but their motivation is the same the wellspring is the same in both cases computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes science is built up of facts as a house is with stones but a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house science is the knowledge of consequences and dependence of one fact upon another inspiration in science may have to do with ideas but not in art in art it is in the senses that are instinctively responsive to the medium of expression no science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power indeed in view of its function religion stands in greater need of a rational foundation of its ultimate principles than even the dogmas of science yet higher religion which is only a search for a larger life is essentially experience and recognized the necessity of experience as its foundation long before science learnt to do so many people and governments share the mistaken belief that science with new ingenious devices and techniques can rescue us from the troubles we face without our having to mend our ways and change our patterns of activity this is not so vast is the field of science the more a man knows the more he will find he has to know science is organized knowledge in science the important thing is to modify and change ones ideas as science advances the humanities need to be defended today against the encroachments of physical science as they once needed to be against the encroachment of theology if christianity is not scientific and science is not god then there is no invariable law and truth becomes an accident i started out writing much more science fictiony stuff and writing about science fiction i also think we need to maintain distinctions  the doctrine of creation is different from a scientific cosmology and we should resist the temptation which sometimes scientists give in to to try to assimilate the concepts of theology to the concepts of science science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation but you cant construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history advertising the science of arresting the human intelligence long enough to get money from it i landed a job with roger corman the job was to write the english dialogue for a russian science fiction picture i didnt speak any russian he didnt care whether i could understand what they were saying he wanted me to make up dialogue i graduated from the university of delaware with a double major in history and political science i liked math  that was my favorite subject  and i was very interested in astronomy and in physical science so i decided on science when i was in college science has proof without any certainty creationists have certainty without any proof of all the failed technologies that litter the onward march of science  steam carriages zeppelins armoured trains  none has been so catastrophic to prosperity as the last centurys attempt to generate electricity from nuclear fission the whole of science and one is tempted to think the whole of the life of any thinking man is trying to come to terms with the relationship between yourself and the natural world why are you here and how do you fit in and whats it all about just after world war ii this country led the world in science by every way you could measure it yet the number of scientists was a tiny proportion of what it is now science is a cemetery of dead ideas true science teaches above all to doubt and to be ignorant we know from science that nothing in the universe exists as an isolated or independent entity i dont think makeup is rocket science or a cure for cancer all science is either physics or stamp collecting new discoveries in science will continue to create a thousand new frontiers for those who still would adventure art is i science is we our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality this view of the world  biocentrism  revolves around the way a subjective experience which we call consciousness relates to a physical process it is a vast mystery and one that i have pursued my entire life the no child left behind program was an incentive to the schools to get their kids up to snuff on math and science and reading theres no question that as science knowledge and technology advance that we will attempt to do more significant things and theres no question that we will always have to temper those things with ethics it is the business of the future to be dangerous and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties nothing retains less of desire in art in science than this will to industry booty possession weve made science experiments of ourselves and our children a body of work such as pasteurs is inconceivable in our time no man would be given a chance to create a whole science nowadays a path is scarcely opened up when the crowd begins to pour in before a war military science seems a real science like astronomy but after a war it seems more like astrology i was always very interested in science and i knew that for me science was a better longterm career than tennis rocket science is tough and rockets have a way of failing science is fun science is curiosity we all have natural curiosity science is a process of investigating its posing questions and coming up with a method its delving in nature is not simply a technical or economical resource and human beings are not mere numbers to suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science environmental management government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic humanity has experienced many revolutionary changes over the course of history revolutions in agriculture in science industrial production as well as numerous political revolutions but these have all been limited to the external aspects of our individual and collective lives the most important thing we can do is inspire young minds and to advance the kind of science math and technology education that will help youngsters take us to the next phase of space travel science always uses metaphor if you start any large theory such as quantum mechanics plate tectonics evolution it takes about 40 years for mainstream science to come around gaia has been going for only 30 years or so fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science im not religious but i put it that way because i feel so strongly its the one thing you do not ever do youve got to have standards what i like about sceptics is that in good science you need critics that make you think crumbs have i made a mistake here if you dont have that continuously you really are up the creek the good sceptics have done a good service but some of the mad ones i think have not done anyone any favours faulkner is a writer who has had much to do with my soul but hemingway is the one who had the most to do with my craft  not simply for his books but for his astounding knowledge of the aspect of craftsmanship in the science of writing science fiction films are not about science they are about disaster which is one of the oldest subjects of art this means that to entrust to science  or to deliberate control according to scientific principles  more than scientific method can achieve may have deplorable effects true science is never speculative it employs hypotheses as suggesting points for inquiry but it never adopts the hypotheses as though they were demonstrated propositions just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology the older generation had greater respect for land than science but we live in an age when science more than soil has become the provider of growth and abundance living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality its time to let science and medicine not politics and rhetoric lead us to good sound policy facts matter science matters reason matters mitt romney has shown an inability to respect any of the three president barack obama not only respects them he relies on them he is an overwhelming and unquestioned choice to continue as president the science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past the record of truths revealed by experience is eminently practical as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future the worst state of affairs is when science begins to concern itself with art politics is not an exact science we have failed to protect science against speculative extensions of nature continuing to assign physical and mathematical properties to hypothetical entities beyond what is observable in nature millions of people were inspired by the apollo program i was five years old when i watched apollo 11 unfold on television and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science engineering and exploration everything is becoming science fiction from the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century science and technology multiply around us to an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think either we use those languages or we remain mute i think mistakes are the essence of science and law its impossible to conceive of either scientific progress or legal progress without understanding the important role of being wrong and of mistakes the most wonderful discovery made by scientists is science itself the artist does not illustrate science but he frequently responds to the same interests that a scientist does further the dignity of the science itself seems to require that every possible means be explored for the solution of a problem so elegant and so celebrated the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it the wise man regulates his conduct by the theories both of religion and science but he regards these theories not as statements of ultimate fact but as artforms the science linking the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather to the climate crisis has matured tremendously in the last couple of years raising children is a creative endeavor an art rather than a science the commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly  to develop strategies of seeing and showing it is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing to pursue science is not to disparage the things of the spirit in fact to pursue science rightly is to furnish the framework on which the spirit may rise science will explain how but not why it talks about what is not what ought to be science is descriptive not prescriptive it can tell us about causes but it cannot tell us about purposes indeed science disavows purposes in the postenlightenment europe of the 19th century the highest authority was no longer the church instead it was science thus was born racial antisemitism based on two disciplines regarded as science in their day  the scientific study of race and the social darwinism of herbert spencer and ernst haeckel since hiroshima and the holocaust science no longer holds its pristine place as the highest moral authority instead that role is taken by human rights it follows that any assault on jewish life  on jews or judaism or the jewish state  must be cast in the language of human rights dreaming in public is an important part of our job description as science writers but there are bad dreams as well as good dreams were dreamers you see but were also realists of a sort i have a better internal and intuitive understanding of folklore and myth than science and technology so in that way fantasy is easier the purpose of science is not to analyze or describe but to make useful models of the world a model is useful if it allows us to get use out of it it should be mandatory that you understand computer science if you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your familys life but change your ghettos life make your ghetto a good neighbourhood learn science try to be like mark zuckerberg bill gates and steve jobs i hesitate to predict whether this theory is true but if the general opinion of mankind is optimistic then were in for a period of extreme popularity for science fiction some of the fdas own scientists have charged that politics not science is behind the fdas actions it is sometimes important for science to know how to forget the things she is surest of when a scientist is ahead of his times it is often through misunderstanding of current rather than intuition of future truth in science there is never any error so gross that it wont one day from some perspective appear prophetic im afraid for all those wholl have the bread snatched from their mouths by these machines what business has science and capitalism got bringing all these new inventions into the works before society has produced a generation educated up to using them those theologians who are beginning to take the doctrine of creation very seriously should pay some attention to sciences story much of todays public anxiety about science is the apprehension that we may forever be overlooking the whole by an endless obsessive preoccupation with the parts i suggest that the introductory courses in science at all levels from grade school through college be radically revised leave the fundamentals the socalled basics aside for a while and concentrate the attention of all students on the things that are not known the central task of science is to arrive stage by stage at a clearer comprehension of nature but this does not at all mean as it is sometimes claimed to mean a search for mastery over nature very few recognize science as the high adventure it really is the wildest of all explorations ever taken by human beings the chance to glimpse things never seen before the shrewdest maneuver for discovering how the world works were as clever as we think we are but well be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains were at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems we do it in science all the time  theres no reason why we cant do it in other endeavors i like fantasy i like horror science fiction because i can get avantgarde with those performances in those movies the violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science i left science then i went into art but i approach things very analytically i choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them science fiction to me has not only things that wouldnt happen but other planets this much we know journalism is not a precise science its on its best day is a crude art we make mistakes i make mistakes with more than 50 years as a journalist i have at least had the opportunity to blow more stories make more mistakes than maybe anybody in television nothing is less important than which fork you use etiquette is the science of living it embraces everything it is ethics it is honor i didnt mind studying obviously math and the physical science subjects interested me more than some of the more artistic subjects but i think i was a pretty good student today the function of the artist is to bring imagination to science and science to imagination where they meet in the myth science knows no country because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world science like art religion commerce warfare and even sleep is based on presuppositions economics has never been a science  and it is even less now than a few years ago more and more nfl players have been willing their bodies to science so that their brains can be studied even if they die of other causes science has yet to isolate the godiva chocolate or prada gene but that doesnt mean your weakness for pricey swag isnt woven into your dna according to a new study of identical twins its less tv ads or labor day sales that make you buy the things you do than the tastes and temperaments that are already part of you at birth the best thing about science is that hard empirical answers are always there if you look hard enough the best thing about religion is that the very absence of that certainty is what requires  and gives rise to  deep feelings of faith when i began in 1960 individuality wasnt an accepted thing to look for it was about speciesspecific behaviour but animal behaviour is not hard science theres room for intuition women tend to be more intuitive or to admit to being intuitive and maybe the hard science approach isnt so attractive the way that science is taught is very cold i would never have become a scientist if i had been taught like that in israel a land lacking in natural resources we learned to appreciate our greatest national advantage our minds through creativity and innovation we transformed barren deserts into flourishing fields and pioneered new frontiers in science and technology honest pioneer work in the field of science has always been and will continue to be lifes pilot on all sides life is surrounded by hostility this puts us under an obligation enough people have now mentioned bill nye the science guy to me that i now desperately avoid it all costs acceptance of the power of god in ones life lays the groundwork for personal commitment to both science and christianity which so often have been in conflict science is a method to keep yourself from kidding yourself it may be that everything the life science companies are telling us will turn out to be right and theres no problem here whatsoever that defies logic im a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy  not so much horror because i get a bit scared my taste in watching things runs from dramas and lowbudget films to highend fantasyscience fiction i dont know anything about science the media thinks that you have to make science sexy and concentrate on themes such as rivalry and the human issues i hate science fiction i think people are realizing that engineering and science are extremely good degrees to get and youll be very highly paid once youve got them im not into politics but i am committed to a cause ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the uk curriculum alongside science and maths  grounding abstract theory merging the practical with the academic my interest in film is sort of catholic  apart from science fiction and horror movies ill watch almost everything design and technology should be the subject where mathematical brainboxes and science whizzkids turn their bright ideas into useful products if i can get some student interested in science if i can show members of the general public whats going on up there in the space program then my jobs been done what i do is not rocket science but i sure do love it science has nothing to be ashamed of even in the ruins of nagasaki the shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved that is the essence of science ask an impertinent question and you are on the way to a pertinent answer science is spectral analysis art is light synthesis what we must understand is that the industries processes and inventions created by modern science can be used either to subjugate or liberate the choice is up to us im an amateur science enthusiast im not even a professional enthusiast i dont know anything i never even passed biology in high school but i read the science section of the newspaper i dont think theres a date minimum or maximum i dont get the whole all right youve got to wait three days to call after the date if i got a number from a girl id call that night theres no science to it for me you just do what it is that you feel like doing nature engenders the science of painting when people think about computer science they imagine people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night my father was my main influence he was a preacher but he was also a history and political science teacher and since he was my hero i wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a teacher unfortunately the global warming hysteria as i see it is driven by politics more than by science unfortunately things are different in climate science because the arguments have become heavily politicised to say that the dogmas are wrong has become politically incorrect the world of science and the world of literature have much in common each is an international club helping to tie mankind together across barriers of nationality race and language i have been doubly lucky being accepted as a member of both what we see today is an american economy that has boomed because of policies and developments of the 1950s and 60s the interstatehighway system massive funding for science and technology a publiceducation system that was the envy of the world and generous immigration policies learn about the world the way it works any kind of science and anthropology its really an interesting place we live in evolution is a really fantastic idea even more than the idea of god i think the world has changed  through technology through winemaking techniques the quality of wine is greater than its ever been whereas ten fifteen years ago it was very easy to find lots of bad wine its kind of hard now the technology the science  its like are you kidding were in the golden years of wine well logos is science or reason something that helps us to function practically and effectively in the world and it must therefore be closely in tune and reflect accurately the realities of the world around us science has to be understood in its broadest sense as a method for comprehending all observable reality and not merely as an instrument for acquiring specialized knowledge it is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that some portion of the neglect of science in england may be attributed to the system of education we pursue perhaps it would be better for science that all criticism should be avowed that science has long been neglected and declining in england is not an opinion originating with me but is shared by many and has been expressed by higher authority than mine the accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages to those who have chosen the profession of medicine a knowledge of chemistry and of some branches of natural history and indeed of several other departments of science affords useful assistance id love to do a movie where the monster is human where the issue is not otherworldly or horror or science fiction science was something that really caught my attention it was something i really could sink my teeth into chastity is the cement of civilization and progress without it there is no stability in society and without it one cannot attain the science of life equipped with his five senses man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure science what business has science and capitalism got bringing all these new inventions into the works before society has produced a generation educated up to using them i very much enjoyed my career in science i didnt leave science because i was disillusioned but felt id done my bit for it after about twentyfive years if the experience of science teaches anything its that the world is very strange and surprising the many revolutions in science have certainly shown that people and especially theologians should try to familiarize themselves with scientific ideas of course science is technical in many respects but there are some very good books that try to set out some of the conceptual structure of science science may never come up with a better office communication system than the coffee break thence results for science as well as for industry the necessity of the division and association of labor i receive and i give  such is human life each directs and is directed in his turn it is critical to develop a biofuel industry powered by feedstocks produced in every corner of the country in addition to the midwest that is why usda has established five regional research centers working on science necessary to ensure profitable biofuels can be produced from a diverse range of feedstocks fashion is the science of appearance and it inspires one with the desire to seem rather than to be now science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research which may provide our scientists with many answers that have for so long been beyond our grasp anthropology is the science which tells us that people are the same the whole world over  except when they are different there does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science there are science and the applications of science bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it and by the way i wanted to point out that kindred is not science fiction youll note theres no science in it its a kind of grim fantasy what im working on now  im back to fantasy although considering that its me im turning it into a kind of science fantasy its a vampire story  but my vampires are biological vampires they didnt become vampires because someone bit them they were born that way ive always seen the world through the eyes of a scientist i love the predictable outcomes that science gives us the control over the world that that can render our science has become terrible our research dangerous our findings deadly we physicists have to make peace with reality reality is not as strong as we are we will ruin reality the main reason for the failure of the modern medical science is that it is dealing with results and not causes nothing more than the patching up of those attacked and the burying of those who are slain without a thought being given to the real strong hold since i was an atheist for many years and came to believe in god through my studies in science it frustrated me to see students and parents who viewed faith and science as enemies it is not so for art in appreciation because art is concerned with human behavior and science is concerned with the behavior of metal or energy it depends on what the fashion is now today its energy its the same soul behind it the same soul you see i had bohemian parents in seattle in the last 60s living in a houseboat my dad wrote science fiction novels and painted big murals and oil paintings now the main areas of higher education that still enjoy considerable financial support from government are subjects like engineering and science and the research ringfence which is the basic minimum to protect britains scientific competitiveness ive loved science fiction ever since i was a little kid mainly from looking at the covers of sciencefiction magazines and books and ive read quite extensively as an adult unlike scientism science in the true sense of the word is open to unbiased investigation of any existing phenomena traditional academic science describes human beings as highly developed animals and biological thinking machines we appear to be newtonian objects made of atoms molecules cells tissues and organs the materialistic paradigm of western science has been a major obstacle for any objective evaluation of the data describing the events occurring at the time of death according to materialistic science any memory requires a material substrate such as the neuronal network in the brain or the dna molecules of the genes blade runner appears regularly two or three times a year in various shapes and forms of science fiction it set the pace for what is essentially urban science fiction urban future and its why ive never revisited that area because i feel ive done it rocket science is really where i fell in love with filmmaking i think camp was incredible but it was so bizarre and i was trying to find my footing in this world where you dont have an audience for immediate validation more than fantasy or even science fiction ray bradbury wrote horror and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear of anything he wasnt afraid of looking uncool  he wasnt scared to openly love innocence or to be optimistic or to write sentimentally when he felt that way growing up in the 70s and 80s science fiction and especially fantasy had such a stigma attached to them i felt so punished and exiled for being devoted to these things much of what tea party candidates claimed about the world and the global economy during the 2010 elections would have earned their adherents a welldeserved f in any freshman economics or earth science class experimental science is fascinating but i dont want to do it i want other people to do it and ill read about it i have a phd in cell biology and thats really manual labor i mean experimental science you do it with your hands so its very different youre out there in a lab cleaning test tubes and it just wasnt that fascinating my background was computer science and business school so eventually i worked my way up where i was running product groups  development testing marketing user education the ever quickening advances of science made possible by the success of the human genome project will also soon let us see the essences of mental disease only after we understand them at the genetic level can we rationally seek out appropriate therapies for such illnesses as schizophrenia and bipolar disease with acknowledgement of residues we can be more easily prepared to grant the unit of science the overlapping of disciplines and the total coherence of all facts observation is a passive science experimentation an active science instead in the absence of respect for human rights science and its offspring technology have been used in this century as brutal instruments for oppression ive got a full plate yes i do that ipod thats nice a phone recorder nicely done all right im a bit of a tech geek i have a subscription to popular science and i keep up on all this stuff drill everything mine everything roll back regulations tweak the science expedite permits sound familiar the republicans offer up more 19thcentury solutions to our 21stcentury energy problems many of the mainstream agricultural scientists especially at the agricultural schools but at all of our major universities are tied into all sorts of contractual relationships and consulting relationships with the life science companies whats different here is that we have now technologies that allow these life science companies to bypass classical breeding thats what makes it both powerful and exciting were losing track of the vastness of the potential for computer science we really have to revive the beautiful intellectual joy of it as opposed to the business potential ive always felt that the humancentered approach to computer science leads to more interesting more exotic more wild and more heroic adventures than the machinesupremacy approach where information is the highest goal modern science cannot explain why the laws of physics are exactly balanced for animal life to exist teachers started recognizing me and praising me for being smart in science and that made me want to be even smarter in science the chief difficulty which prevents men of science from believing in divine as well as in nature spirits is their materialism natural science does not simply describe and explain nature it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves just as houses are made of stones so is science made of facts science is facts one would have to have completely forgotten the history of science so as to not remember that the desire to know nature has had the most constant and the happiest influence on the development of mathematics if we reject science we reject the common man biology is the science evolution is the concept that makes biology unique to that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the western nomenclature and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population if science fiction is the mythology of modern technology then its myth is tragic science is analytical descriptive informative man does not live by bread alone but by science he attempts to do so hence the deadliness of all that is purely scientific the art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge i think computer science by and large is still stuck in the modern age postmodernism was a reaction against modernism it came quite early to music and literature and a little later to architecture and i think its still coming to computer science before i was reading science fiction i read hemingway farewell to arms was my first adult novel that said not everything ends well it was one of those times where reading has meant a great deal to me in terms of my development  an insight came from that book i had read tons of science fiction i was fascinated by other worlds other environments for me it was fantasy but it was not fantasy in the sense of pure escapism i was always good at math and science and i never realized that that was unusual or somehow undesirable i love biomedical science i love astronomy and you cant really do much with those in a fantasy setting science is his forte and omniscience his foible we have found that where science has progressed the farthest the mind has but regained from nature that which the mind put into nature one of the nice things about science fiction is that it lets us carry out thought experiments religion is to mysticism what popularization is to science my parents divorced when i was born and my mother is a political science professor like a feminist mormon which is sort of an oxymoron i did one scifi movie i did gattaca i liked gattaca because that was always the kind of science fiction i really dug the nonaction oriented scifi weve heard from many teachers that they used episodes of star trek and concepts of star trek in their science classrooms in order to engage the students science fiction was never my thing i have no interest in it i dont really see science fiction as fiction i can imagine colonies on mars and everything and i have lived since  as you have  in a period of cold war during which we have ensured by our achievements in the science and technology of destruction that a third act in this tragedy of war will result in the peace of extinction from all this it follows what the general character of the problem of the development of a body of scientific knowledge is in so far as it depends on elements internal to science itself my training in science of mind had begun with my mother she took me to a different church every sunday and she encouraged me to question the minister afterward i was raised on comic books and i love science fiction i like science fiction and physics things like that planets being sucked into black holes and the various vortexes that create possibility and what happens on the other side of the black hole to me its the microcosmic study of the macrocosmic universe in man and thats why im attracted to it pure phenomenology claims to be the science of pure phenomena this concept of the phenomenon which was developed under various names as early as the eighteenth century without being clarified is what we shall have to deal with first of all i do enjoy reading some science fiction i was always attracted to science fiction movies we sat around on a hotel balcony with a bottle of wine and tried to figure out how you would go about blowing up a planet thats the kind of conversations science fiction writers have when they get together we dont talk about football or anything like that biology meaning the science of all life is a late notion there were certain questions about the foundations of morals that advances in science all threaten to make more complicated i would like to do a science fiction film some day star wars seems really to have destroyed the genre which at one time offered great musical opportunities cultural anthropology is more and more rapidly getting to realize itself as a strictly historical science science consistently produces a new crop of miraculous truths and dazzling devices every year science grows like a weed every year i was a daydreamer and there is a lot of history and geography and science i missed out on because i was in my head and i regret that i wanted to have a political career i thought studying political science would be the best way to achieve it im a geophysicist and all my earth science books when i was a student i had to give the wrong answer to get an a we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned of marshall kays geosynclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap psychology is the science of the act of experiencing and deals with the whole system of such acts as they make up mental life while most of us know that we feel better after a good hearty laugh science in many cases is yet to prove why the main purpose of science is simplicity and as we understand more things everything is becoming simpler science is the systematic classification of experience science is not addressed to poets science has produced such powerful weapons that in a war between great powers there would be neither victor nor vanquished both would be overwhelmed in destruction science may be described as the art of systematic oversimplification science must begin with myths and with the criticism of myths science is for those who learn poetry is for those who know ive started a company called tall girl productions and weve got our first project that is purely producing not writing with a writer named evan daugherty its for nbc its called afterthought and its science fictionish thats fun this is actually a very important principle that science is learning about large systems like evolution and that futurists are learning about anticipating human society just because a future scenario is plausible doesnt mean we can get there from here the rise of google the rise of facebook the rise of apple i think are proof that there is a place for computer science as something that solves problems that people face every day a second reason why science cannot replace judgement is the behavior of financial markets i cannot say how strongly i object to people using other peoples writing as research research is nonfiction especially for horror fantasy science fiction do not take your research from other peoples fiction just dont if margaret thatcher took climate change seriously and believed that we should take action to reduce global greenhouse emissions then taking action and supporting and accepting the science can hardly be the mark of incipient bolshevism science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence christmas renews our youth by stirring our wonder the capacity for wonder has been called our most pregnant human faculty for in it are born our art our science our religion i began reading science fiction before i was 12 and started writing science fiction around the same time science fiction let me do both it let me look into science and stick my nose in everywhere the thing about science fiction is that its totally wide open but its wide open in a conditional way fantasy is totally wide open all you really have to do is follow the rules youve set but if youre writing about science you have to first learn what youre writing about no one was going to stop me from writing and no one had to really guide me towards science fiction it was natural really that i would take that interest so fantasy was fine early on and when i discovered science fiction i was very happy with it because my first interest in science fiction came with an interest in astronomy i was attracted to science fiction because it was so wide open i was able to do anything and there were no walls to hem you in and there was no human condition that you were stopped from examining i told my father i had to try political science for a year he thought i was throwing my life away one of the things that ultimately led me to leave mathematics and go into political science was thinking i could prevent nuclear war science has sometimes been said to be opposed to faith and inconsistent with it but all science in fact rests on a basis of faith for it assumes the permanence and uniformity of natural laws  a thing which can never be demonstrated for a member to say im a lame duck violates political science 101 with science fiction theres endless possibilities science fiction is becoming more of a diverse kind of genre the science of life is changing hearts and minds in science there is only physics all the rest is stamp collecting ah the creative process is the same secret in science as it is in art they are all the same absolutely were looking at earth science observing our planet also space science looking at the ozone in the atmosphere around our earth also looking at life science and on a human level using ourselves as test subjects i decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms there are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people from making use of ones contributions to computer science people think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite just many people doing things that build on eachother like a wall of mini stones i think if im going to do a science fiction im going to go down a new path that i want to do science makes no pretension to eternal truth or absolute truth science is an integral part of culture its not this foreign thing done by an arcane priesthood its one of the glories of the human intellectual tradition i dont think academic writing ever was wonderful however science used to be much less specialized goethe died in 1832 as you know goethe was very active in science in fact he did some very good scientific work in plant morphology and mineralogy but he was quite bitter at the way in which many scientists refused to grant him a hearing because he was a poet and therefore they felt he couldnt be serious science is not a heartless pursuit of objective information it is a creative human activity its geniuses acting more as artists than as information processors my entry into the environmental arena was through the issue that so dramatically  and destructively  demonstrates the link between science and social action nuclear weapons the age of innocent faith in science and technology may be over psychology is the science of the intellects characters and behavior of animals including man i didnt invent forensic science and medicine i just was one of the first people to recognize how interesting it is science is always inquiring i felt strongly that since the pursuit of good science was so difficult it was essential that the problem being studied was an important one to justify the effort expanded i have an idealistic view of science as a liberalising and progressive force for humanity i think it was this curiosity about the natural world which awoke my early interest in science like many students i found the drudgery of real experiments and the slowness of progress a complete shock and at my low points i contemplated other alternative careers including study of the philosophy or sociology of science in the spirit of science there really is no such thing as a failed experiment any test that yields valid data is a valid test thats the show its like 5 minutes of science and then 10 minutes of me hurting myself we didnt set out to be educators or even scientists and we dont purport that what we do is real science but were demonstrating a methodology by which one can engage and satisfy your curiosity rationalism and newtonian science has lured us into dark woods but a new metaphysics can rescue us most modern science fiction went to school on dune even harry potter with its boy protagonist who has not yet grown into his destiny shares a common theme when i read it for the first time i felt like i had learned another language mastered a new culture adopted a new religion fruitful discourse in science or theology requires us to believe that within the contexts of normal discourse there are some true statements i believe very strongly and have fought since many years ago  at least over 30 years ago  to get architecture not just within schools but architecture talked about under history geography science technology art in poland my audience is all women between 18 and 30 at us conventions you have the fantasy and science fiction crowd at harvard you have an entirely different audience its so schizophrenic in teaching man experimental science results in lessening his pride more and more by proving to him every day that primary causes like the objective reality of things will be hidden from him forever and that he can only know relations experimentation is an active science science does not permit exceptions the most exciting thing in the twentieth century is science young people ask me if this country is serious about science they arent thinking about the passport that they will hold but the country that they must rely on for support and encouragement when as we must often do we fear science we really fear ourselves science never gives up searching for truth since it never claims to have achieved it it is this at its most basic that makes science a humane pursuit it acknowledges the commonality of peoples experience though neglectful of their responsibility to protect science scientists are increasingly aware of their responsibility to society science gives us a powerful vocabulary and it is impossible to produce a vocabulary with which one can only say nice things better to die in the pursuit of civilized values we believed than in a flight underground we were offering a value system couched in the language of science today academies of science use their influence around the world in support of human rights the respect for human rights essential if we are to use technology wisely is not something alien that must be grafted onto science on the contrary it is integral to science as also to scholarship in general for science must breathe the oxygen of freedom science exists moreover only as a journey toward troth stifle dissent and you end that journey while that amendment failed human cloning continues to advance and the breakthrough in this unethical and morally questionable science is around the corner mothers unless they were very poor didnt work both of my parents had to leave education my mother had to work in a cotton mill until 18 or 19 when she took some training in domestic science as a theoretical physicist i feel at once proud and humble at the thought of the illustrious figures that have preceded me here to receive the greatest of all honors in science the nobel prize you know there was a time just before i started to study physical science when astronomers thought that systems such as we have here in the solar system required a rare triple collision of stars science and vision are not opposites or even at odds they need each other i sometimes hear other startup folks say something along the lines of if entrepreneurship was a science then anyone could do it id like to point out that even science is a science and still very few people can do it let alone do it well except in very narrow cases where theres breakthrough science that needs patent production worrying about competitors is a waste of time if you cant out iterate someone who is trying to copy you youre toast anyway perfect as the wing of a bird may be it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air facts are the air of science without them a man of science can never rise todays preoccupation with physical theories of everything takes a wrong turn from the purpose of science  to question all things relentlessly modern physics has become like swifts kingdom of laputa flying absurdly on an island above the earth and indifferent to what is beneath amazingly when you add life and consciousness to the equation you can actually explain some of the biggest puzzles of science i think its science and physics are just starting to learn from all these experiments these experiments have been carried out hundreds and hundreds of times in all sorts of ways that no physicist really questions the end point i think that these experiments are very clearly telling us that consciousness is limitless and the ultimate reality fashion is more about feel than science in some parts of life like mathematics and science yeah i was a genius i would top all the top scores you could ever measure it by research is of considerable importance in certain fields such as science and history the east germans first used biomechanics this meant that rather than guessing about technique and form they could apply changes to athletic performance based on science to recover a spiritual tradition in which creation and the study of creation matters would be to inaugurate new possibilities between spirituality and science that would shape the paradigms for culture its institution and its people invented languages have often been created in tandem with entire invented universes and most conlangers come to their craft by way of fantasy and science fiction advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for australians is one of the highest in the world science fiction encourages us to explore all the futures good and bad that the human mind can envision i became kind of a dropout in science after i came back to america i wanted to photograph you see i became kind of a dropout in science after i came back to america politics is the science of urgencies science is knowledge arranged and classified according to truth facts and the general laws of nature thousands of years ago humans domesticated every possible large wild mammal species fulfilling all those criteria and worth domesticating with the result that there have been no valuable additions of domestic animals in recent times despite the efforts of modern science tasmanian history is a study of human isolation unprecedented except in science fiction  namely complete isolation from other humans for 10000 years were uncomfortable about considering history as a science its classified as a social science which is considered not quite scientific he that desireth to acquire any art or science seeketh first those means by which that art or science is obtained if we ought to do so in things natural and earthly how much more then in spiritual i shopped at j crew in high school i studied computer science i was a nerdnerd now im a musicnerd it seems true that the growth of science and secularism made organized christianity feel under threat evolutionary naturalism takes the inherent limitations of science and turns them into a devastating philosophical weapon because science is our only real way of knowing anything what science cannot know cannot be real theres a new science out called orthomolecular medicine you correct the chemical imbalance with amino acids and vitamins and minerals that are naturally in the body in general science journalism concerns itself with what has been published in a handful of peerreviewed journals  nature cell the new england journal of medicine  which set the agenda the big journals and nobel laureates are the equivalent of congressional leaders in science journalism until politics are a branch of science we shall do well to regard political and social reforms as experiments rather than shortcuts to the millennium there can be no truce between science and religion and if we must educate our poets and artists in science we must educate our masters labour and capital in art science fiction is trying to find alternative ways of looking at realities my point has always been that ever since the industrial revolution science fiction has been the most important genre there is a lot of what the culture is about is a reaction to all the science fiction i was reading in my very early teens i think a lot of people are frightened of technology and frightened of change and the way to deal with something youre frightened of is to make fun of it thats why science fiction fans are dismissed as geeks and nerds science fiction has its own history its own legacy of whats been done whats been superseded whats so much part of the furniture its practically part of the fabric now whats become no more than a joke and so on its just plain foolish as well as comically arrogant to ignore all this to fail to do the most basic research but because we live in an age of science we have a preoccupation with corroborating our myths sound science must be our guide in choosing which problems to tackle and how to approach them when i got my phd it was a time when there were just no jobs for phds period phds were getting the lowest paid technician jobs if they were lucky in any kind of science the science for which the united states is respected has nothing to do with the unscientific and baseless theory of evolution evolution is the fundamental idea in all of life science  in all of biology science is a wonderful discipline to which we are deeply indebted science fiction has a way of letting you talk about where we are in the world and letting you be a bit of a pop philosopher without being didactic i didnt understand how you could be an actor if you didnt also study philosophy and study political science astronomy and also just go out and live life and have experiences much of indian science seems intuitive and not bound by the rigid thinking of classical scientists i hope every woman out there who wants to be a mother and is suffering with infertility will explore all the options and know that if you choose the science route it is okay our work on light bulbs wasnt an arbitrary mandate we didnt just pick a standard out of the air or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility instead we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable some ideas you have to chew on then roll them around a lot play with them before you can turn them into funky science fiction i would love to photograph stephen hawking i am just fascinated by science i really am science goes from question to question big questions and little tentative answers the questions as they age grow ever broader the answers are seen to be more limited paleoanthropology is not a science that ends with the discovery of a bone one has to have the original to work with it is a lifelong task i developed that for a long time i also developed sugar sweet science at new line and that didnt happen that was a boxing movie and between all that there were a couple of other things in science all facts no matter how trivial or banal enjoy democratic equality theres a lot of interesting words nomenclatures in science my political science degree is always on the backburner i took my lsat so even if i want to take the lsat again i know what im getting into ill keep it on the backburner who knows maybe with my popularity i can have a career in politics with a law degree i think itll work out either way science and literature give me answers and they ask me questions i will never be able to answer nothing matters but the facts without them the science of criminal investigation is nothing more than a guessing game modem science then maintains on the one hand that nature both organic and inorganic strives towards a state of order and that mans actions are governed by the same tendency if on occasion the knowledge brought by science leads to an unhappy end this is not to the discredit of science but is rather an indication of an imperfect ability to use wisely the gifts placed within our hands great moments in science einstein discovers that time is actually money comedy is very hard but you have to learn the art and science of it if i wasnt doing this id be in school studying political science or socioeconomic something i love visiting different cultures and finding out how they make up a society i wanted to be a political science professor and go to school in boston i never wanted to be a big famous movie star and tv star it kind of found me the science of boobytrapping has taken a good deal of the fun out of following hot on the enemys heels i think what a life in science really teaches you is the vastness of our ignorance without renouncing the support of physics it is possible for the physiology of the senses not only to pursue its own course of development but also to afford to physical science itself powerful assistance ive always loved 3d in fact as a kid i was exposed to 3d at an early age because my grandfather was a specialist of 3d in cinematheques and then my cousin put it in science of sleep with toilet paper tube cities but he was a specialist and i always wanted to do something in 3d we tried war we tried aggression we tried intervention none of it works why dont we try peace as a science of human relations not as some vague notion  as everyday work gender consciousness has become involved in almost every intellectual field history literature science anthropology theres been an extraordinary advance i think the perception of there being a deep gulf between science and the humanities is false im writing a review of three books on feminism and science and its about social constructionism so i would say im a social constructionist whatever that means now venus is an extremely hostile environment and as such presents a lot of challenges for a science fiction author who wants to create life there however as i began to research it more thoroughly i found myself intrigued by the possibilities the world offers when we see the shadow on our images are we seeing the time 11 minutes ago on mars or are we seeing the time on mars as observed from earth now its like time travel problems in science fiction when is now when was then hgh testing is happening in olympics the science is there it is a valid test one of the reasons i did this because i wasnt really looking for another science fiction film was that my daughter can see it shes 9 and its really a good film for all ages by exploring the political and moral colorings of discoveries about what makes us tick we can have a more honest science and a less fearful intellectual milieu dont confuse hypothesis and theory the former is a possible explanation the latter the correct one the establishment of theory is the very purpose of science facts are not science  as the dictionary is not literature in the sick room ten cents worth of human understanding equals ten dollars worth of medical science science fiction outside of poetry is the only literary field which has no limits no parameters whatsoever in science fiction you can also test out your own realities i wrote the very first stories in science fiction which dealt with homosexuality the world well lost and affair with a green monkey in the forensic science course i took at university they used photographs of dead bodies for ballistics they showed us a guy lying on the floor and his head had burst my personal conviction is that science is concerned wholly with truth not with ethics i would be more frightened as a writer if people thought my movies were like science fiction but the imposition of morality onto science  where it does not belong  has become rampant in recent years winning is the science of being totally prepared ive always been a big fan of science fiction and of the worlds of the spiritual and the mystic and i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction especially apocalyptic and postapocalyptic fiction im really convinced that our descendants a century or two from now will look back at us with the same pity that we have toward the people in the field of science two centuries ago the origin of life is one of the great outstanding mysteries of science in science a healthy skepticism is a professional necessity whereas in religion having belief without evidence is regarded as a virtue science we are repeatedly told is the most reliable form of knowledge about the world because it is based on testable hypotheses religion by contrast is based on faith the term doubting thomas well illustrates the difference a permanent base on mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology if as some evidence suggests exotic microorganisms have arisen independently of terrestrial life studying them could revolutionise biology medicine and biotechnology for me science is already fantastical enough unlocking the secrets of nature with fundamental physics or cosmology or astrobiology leads you into a wonderland compared with which beliefs in things like alien abductions pale into insignificance though we do need more women to graduate with technical degrees i always like to remind women that you dont need to have science or technology degrees to build a career in tech is there anything science should not try to explain science is knowledge and knowledge is power  power to do good or evil sometimes ignorance is bliss cosmologists have attempted to account for the daytoday laws you find in textbooks in terms of fundamental superlaws but the superlaws themselves must still be accepted as brute facts so maybe the ultimate laws of nature will always be offlimits to science traditionally scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply given elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth and fixed thereafter inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science the birth of science as we know it arguably began with isaac newtons formulation of the laws of gravitation and motion it is no exaggeration to say that physics was reborn in the early 20thcentury with the twin revolutions of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity a man ceases to be a beginner in any given science and becomes a master in that science when he has learned that he is going to be a beginner all his life i got to spend all of my time every day at work reading and editing papers about cuttingedge technical research and getting paid for it then id go home at night and turn what i learned into science fiction stories i wanted the feel in these books to be like an epic fantasy with kings queens dukes and court politics but of course like what i was explaining before about making the science make sense you have to make the politics make sense too dune is the bestselling science fiction book of all time its something you really need to read in your lifetime if youre going to read the lord of the rings which everyone should then you have to read dune too we especially need imagination in science one of the problems weve had is that the ict curriculum in the past has been written for a subject that is changing all the time i think that what we should have is computer science in the future  and how it fits in to the curriculum is something we need to be talking to scientists to experts in coding and to young people about we need to be proscience we have to go back to science the thing that interests me least about the radio business is the radio business but ive had to learn a little bit about it its not rocket science you get ratings thats good it turns out that understanding the british public is not rocket science the british appreciate honesty and they also have a bonkers offthewall sense of humour like me if you just have a single problem to solve then fine go ahead and use a neural network but if you want to do science and understand how to choose architectures or how to go to a new problem you have to understand what different architectures can and cannot do science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species it is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are i think understanding how the universe was born is very important it really gives us a perspective on many things from my earliest acquaintance with the science of political economy it has been evident to my mind that capital was the product of labor and that therefore in its best analysis there could be no natural conflict between capital and labor many writers upon the science of political economy have declared that it is the duty of a nation first to encourage the creation of wealth and second to direct and control its distribution all such theories are delusive when i was younger i wanted to be a big movie star whod get to be funny on talk shows and then i wanted to retire and write science fiction science already contained all that was necessary if you just brought it out and i thought i would just share with you what science says today about silicone breast implants if you have them youre healthier than if you dont in fact theres no science that shows that silicone breast implants are detrimental and in fact they make you healthier intelligence is not a science i certainly saw science as a kind of calling and one with as much legitimacy as a religious calling i did get a very fine education and not just in science it took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that i really should take an interest in humanities i hope ive lived a life of science whose style will encourage younger people id like to put in a vote for the intrinsic fascination of science im chairing a unesco committee on how to improve global internet communications for science help thirdworld people get onto the net so they can be part of the process the general public has long been divided into two parts those who think science can do anything and those who are afraid it will music is not math its science you keep mixing the stuff up until it blows up on you or it becomes this incredible potion english once accepted as an international language is no more secure than french has proved to be as the one and only accepted language of diplomacy or as latin has proved to be as the international language of science the modern mind tends to be more and more critical and analytical in spirit hence it must devise for itself an engine of expression which is logically defensible at every point and which tends to correspond to the rigorous spirit of modern science i think of it as a good opportunity to let in particular school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science and that its not just for a select group of people usually girls werent encouraged to go to college and major in math and science my high school calculus teacher ms paz jensen made math appealing and motivated me to continue studying it in college as a kid i wanted to write science fiction and i was never without a book later i really got into being a scientist and never thought id be writing novels science has not been successful by making up explanations of things that fit with the current social fabric science rests on reason and experiment and can meet an opponent with calmness but a belief is always sensitive the man of science is nothing if not a poet gone wrong a successful society is characterized by a rising living standard for its population increasing investment in factories and basic infrastructure and the generation of additional surplus which is invested in generating new discoveries in science and technology as a child i read science fiction but from the very beginnings of my reading for pleasure i read a lot of nonfictional history particularly historical biography i dont dare postulate about science but i know that it takes both emotion and intellect in order for art to happen todays recording techniques would have been regarded as science fiction forty years ago a person that much interested in science is going to neglect his social life somewhat but not completely because that isnt healthy either so one has to work it out according to ones own inclinations how one wants to proportion these things unfortunately a lot of the concepts in the bible are based on ancient mythology that doesnt fit the findings of science i went to college at the university of kansas where i got a degree in political science the virtues of science are skepticism and independence of thought the conscious purpose of science is control of nature its unconscious effect is disruption and chaos so my degree was in political science which i think was  the closest i could come to marketing is politics in order for america to remain a global leader in innovation and opportunity we must give our children a solid foundation in math and science in the last fifty years science has advanced more than in the 2000 previous years and given mankind greater powers over the forces of nature than the ancients ascribed to their gods as i have tried to show science in producing the airplane and the wireless has created a new international political environment to which governments must adjust their foreign policies i was born in 1950 and watched science fiction and horror movies on tv and was always really fascinated by them i do not think we are ever going to be able to for a long time get the kind of quality of school personnel that we need in our schools especially in the areas of science and math one of the answers to that problem is to use more educational technology science has everything to say about what is possible science has nothing to say about what is permissible first i think the science of monetary economics has clearly gotten better and finally no matter how good the science gets there are problems that inevitably depend on judgement on art on a feel for financial markets i love science fiction ive tried to be a straight scientist doing the science and reporting it as best i can you have no time to do the science if youre talking to the media what has become clear from the science is that we cannot burn all of the fossil fuels without creating a very different planet as a microbiologist i am particularly concerned with mr bushs blatant disregard for science at a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role and conduct themselves accordingly but the first the general public learned about the discovery was the news of the destruction of hiroshima by the atom bomb a splendid achievement of science and technology had turned malign science became identified with death and destruction from my earliest days i had a passion for science i did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science i saw science as being in harmony with humanity indeed the whole human species is endangered by nuclear weapons or by other means of wholesale destruction which further advances in science are likely to produce truth is i dont think god on a daily basis i think politics science when im not writing i read loads of fiction but ive been writing quite constantly lately so ive been reading a lot of nonfiction  philosophy religion science history social or cultural studies science is defined in various ways but today it is generally restricted to something which is experimental which is repeatable which can be predicted and which is falsifiable the science is clear that there is an increase in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere what is not clear from the science is how much of that increase is caused by human activity and what also is not clear is what impact those increases have on the climatic cycle in science read by preference the newest works in literature read the oldest the classics are always modern oh im nerdy about science fiction and fantasy and graphic novels and reading and im nerdy about board games my favorite board game is a board game im working on right now its a game of napoleonic era naval warfare and its going to be fun this is a global fight to get the right people in the right place and were talking about people with phds in engineering computer science mathematics certainly going back to sherlock holmes we have a tradition of forensic science featured in detective stories weapons of mass destruction arent pulled out of a black hat like a white rabbit at a magic show theyre produced in factories theres science and technology involved theyre not produced in a hole in the ground or in a basement the world is my country science is my religion science is not about control it is about cultivating a perpetual condition of wonder in the face of something that forever grows one step richer and subtler than our latest theory about it it is about reverence not mastery i think that if the novels task is to describe where we find ourselves and how we live now the novelist must take a good hard look at the most central facts of contemporary life  technology and science i really like science because it seems to be that place where you get the big picture everything connects i was a science fiction junkie for a long time unfortunately climate science has become political science it is tragic that some perhaps wellmeaning but politically motivated scientists who should know better have whipped up a global frenzy about a phenomena which is statistically questionable at best when i started in the business there was a thing called adult fantasy but nobody quite knew what it was and most publishers didnt have an adult fantasy list they had science fiction lists which they stuck a little bit of fantasy into i grew up a red sox fan i grew up going to fenway park and the museum of fine arts and the science museum and symphony hall and going to the common walking around my whole family at different times lived and worked in boston science fiction readers probably have the gene for novelty and seem to enjoy a cascade of invention as much as a writer enjoys providing one even if you only want to write science fiction you should also read mysteries poetry mainstream literature history biography philosophy and science we asked ourselves and the world to base decisions on good science and i really believe the united states can be the leader in delivering that message to our international trading partners the goal is to normalize trade relations based on sound science and consumer protection science is the international language so when we are able to convince countries that good decisionmaking for human health and animal health is based upon science thats a real success story for us in beef trade issues we base our decisions upon science when i was born in 1970 with a rare genetic disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita sed medical science wasnt what it is today and my mum and dad were treated terribly by the medical profession beyond that i seem to be compelled to write science fiction rather than fantasy or mysteries or some other genre more likely to climb onto bestseller lists even though i enjoy reading a wide variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction however i wasnt very good at the sciences or didnt have a lot of help in the sciences or something but certainly didnt set science for my a level and when i came to take my a levels i didnt get a good enough result to go to university i would argue that the issue of god and the issue of science have the same roots the time was not yet ripe for the growth of mathematical science among us and any development that might have taken place in that direction was rudely stopped by the civil war one hardly knows where in the history of science to look for an important movement that had its effective start in so pure and simple an accident as that which led to the building of the great washington telescope and went on to the discovery of the satellites of mars it was generally believed that catholics were not interested in arts and science graduate schools they werent going to be intellectuals and so i put the theses to the test and they all collapsed its such a long mission and we get to spend so much time in space were doing such exciting research and i dont want to overemphasize the life science research but as a physician the life science research that were doing is extremely exciting life science research can be done on multiple platforms since we have a very small number of people flying into space the more people you have the better science for hundreds of years has spanned the differences between cultures and between countries computer science is embarrassed by the computer art is made to disturb science reassures american high school students trail teenagers from 14 european and asian countries in reading math and science were even trailing france dont you see whats at stake here the ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space the greatest mystery is right here right under our feet science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer art is everything else we do people who love science fiction really do love sex im from the madeleine lengle school the more she delves into science the more she knows theres a creator whos behind these amazing laws these amazing events the symmetry of nature the structure and order of it i was on the football team because i wanted to experience the different iconic social classes of high school so football for me was an attempt to socially integrate in an interesting way and then i didnt like it anymore and stopped doing it and focused more on drama and science and other forms of art and music i dont think immortality is necessarily the key to understanding the world you have to be careful with what you think youre achieving im all for science discovering amazing and fantastic things about our world but i think the motivations behind it are slightly askew science and art or by the same token poetry and prose differ from one another like a journey and an excursion the purpose of the journey is its goal the purpose of an excursion is the process neither science nor the politics in power nor the mass media nor business nor the law nor even the military are in a position to define or control risks rationally people challenge my nerd cred all the time i just show them the photo of me winning my middleschool science fair wearing my casio calculator watch and eyeglasses so big they look like they can see the future it is not enough to know your craft  you have to have feeling science is all very well but for us imagination is worth far more i was sent to a finishing school which didnt last long when mother found out how badly chaperoned we were then i came out before going to a domestic science school i think there is a tendency in science to measure what is measurable and to decide that what you cannot measure must be uninteresting its very strange writing science fiction in a world that moves as fast as ours does i really like being pregnant not that there arent things i dont love but when i think about what my body is doing  creating a child  it just blows my mind im in awe of the process and science tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations in politics perhaps even in business in science only one thing matters and that is the facts anthropologists are a connecting link between poets and scientists though their fieldwork among primitive peoples has often made them forget the language of science im not being evasive but i am saying im not a scientist and im not directly involved in the consultation however the science must be sound it must be agreed and the consultation must be of a high quality or no one will have any confidence in the process theres a science to ordering potatoes are they skinny shoestring or big fat steak fries you just have to let your taste buds guide you when deciding what to eat i sort of feel that climate change will be solved by science i just feel instinctively that we will find a way of saving ourselves but i am less confident that we wont destroy ourselves in other ways i think the reason people are dealing with science less well now than 50 years ago is that it has become so complicated science moves with the spirit of an adventure characterized both by youthful arrogance and by the belief that the truth once found would be simple as well as pretty science has always been my preoccupation and when you think a breakthrough is possible it is terribly exciting were not all equal its simply not true that isnt science sure science involves trial and error scientists refine theories each day but as they do they help us grasp more clearly the wonders of the world and the universe that said id does not qualify as science because it gives us nothing to test or measure science requires replicable tests involving measurable variables architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences and adorned with much and varied learning by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts perhaps to the uninformed it may appear unaccountable that a man should be able to retain in his memory such a variety of learning but the close alliance with each other of the different branches of science will explain the difficulty harmony is an obscure and difficult musical science but most difficult to those who are not acquainted with the greek language because it is necessary to use many greek words to which there are none corresponding in latin i have to do more close research and fact checking for the science fiction this is not however to say that writing good fantasy does not involve doing good research it is a shock to us in the twentieth century to discover from observations science has made that the fundamental mechanisms of life cannot be ascribed to natural selection and therefore were designed but we must deal with our shock as best we can and go on im mostly a novelist these days but i have written short stories in fantasy science fiction and horror it is often said that science must avoid any conclusions which smack of the supernatural global warming it is a hoax it is bad science it is highjacking public policy it is the greatest scam in history it was a shock to people of the nineteenth century when they discovered from observations science had made that many features of the biological world could be ascribed to the elegant principle of natural selection im not a great science fiction fan myself i probably feel that way about westerns like i used to play cowboys and indians they can act out will and the robot science is not a game in which arbitrary rules are used to decide what explanations are to be permitted the theory of undirected evolution is already dead but the work of science continues science is a selfsufficient activity the thing about science is that its an accurate picture of the world in praising science it does not follow that we must adopt the very poor philosophies which scientific men have constructed in philosophy they have much more to learn than to teach theres no doubt that scientific training helps many authors to write better science fiction and yet several of the very best were english majors who could not parse a differential equation to save their lives predicting has a spotty record in science fiction ive had some failures on the other hand i also predicted the fall of the berlin wall and the rise of fundamentalist islam and im not happy to be right in all of those cases change is the principal feature of our age and literature should explore how people deal with it the best science fiction does that headon but honestly if you do a rigorous survey of my work ill bet youll find that biology is a theme far more often than physical science one of the first rules of science is if somebody delivers a secret weapon to you you better use it the proper study of mankind is the science of design carl took on the militaryindustrial complex he campaigned around the world for an end to the production of weapons of mass destruction to him it was a perversion of science questions have arisen about the policing of science who is responsible for the policing my answer is all of us modern science then so far from being an enemy of romance is seen on every hand to be its sympathetic and resourceful friend its swift and irresistible helper in its serious need and an indulgent minister to its lighter fancies we need to tap the resource of current and retiring science and math professionals that have both content mastery and the practical experience to serve as effective teachers today over half of chinas undergraduate degrees are in math science technology and engineering yet only 16 percent of americas undergraduates pursue these schools math and science fields are not the only areas where we see the united states lagging behind less than 1 percent of american high school students study the critical foreign languages of arabic chinese japanese korean or russian combined i dont read other science fiction i dont read any at all but roy rockwood it was science fiction for the sake of science fiction we must be willing to pay inspiring math and science teachers who have high paying alternatives in industry more to teach and reward students who take more challenging courses in high school with science fiction i think we are preparing ourselves for contact with them whoever they may be the old testament is my favourite science fantasy reading fashion is the science of appearances and it inspires one with the desire to seem rather than to be i dig science fiction though it was never really my thing research and development needs permanent tax credits to build the technology that spurs our growth but no government programs alone can get americas students to study more science and math parents must push and help their children to meet this goal in europe art has to a large degree taken the place of religion in america it seems rather to be science i had never seen much of star trek or any other science fiction before i was cast but sevens wonderful but man has still another powerful resource natural science with its strictly objective methods sound science must be a basis to governing our trade relations around the globe on the other hand the waging of peace as a science as an art is in its infancy but we can trace its growth its steady progress and the time will come when there will be particular individuals designated to assume responsibility for and leadership of this movement i have been a reader of science fiction and fantasy for a long time since i was 11 or 12 i think so i understand it and im not at all surprised that readers of the genre might enjoy my books we have long possessed the art of war and the science of war which have been evolved in the minutest detail of the two i would think of my work as closer to science fiction than fantasy brian and i were both science students you know science sort of math and physics side you know science fiction is not just about the future of space ships travelling to other planets it is fiction based on science and i am using science as my basis for my fiction but its the science of prehistory  palaeontology and archaeology  rather than astronomy or physics every science is a profane restatement of the preceding dogmas of the religious period i have heard science fiction and fantasy referred to as the fiction of ideas and i like that definition but its the mainstream public that chooses my books for the most part i quite enjoy science fiction my fiction is reviewed by the mainstream press by science fiction periodicals romance magazines small press publications and various other journals including some usually devoted to archaeological and other science material theres a big overlap with the people you meet at the fantasy and science fiction cons i could write historical fiction or science fiction or a mystery but since i find it fascinating to research the clues of some little know period and develop a story based on that i will probably continue to do it i finally decided one day reading science fiction magazines of the time i could do at least as well as some of these people are doing so i finally made a serious effort i love having my hands in the dirt it is never a science and always an art there are no rules and if it comes down to me versus that weed im trying to pull out of the ground that doesnt want to come out i know ill win the geezer album black science had a lot of keyboards and it did not work i like to browse in occult bookshops if for no other reason than to refresh my commitment to science even in our day science suspects beyond the polar seas at the very circle of the arctic pole the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which is ever green when i did battlestar galactica it was the first time i really understood science fiction that was a very political drama but set in spaceships so people didnt really take it seriously but some really fascinating things were explored in that science consists exactly of those forms of knowledge that can be verified and duplicated by anybody of course not everybodys willing to go out and do the experiments but for the people who are willing to go out and do that  if the experiments dont work then it means its not science instead of having to be a member of the royal society to do science the way you had to be in england in the 17th 18th centuries today pretty much anybody who wants to do it can and the information that they need to do it is there in this time of budget cuts we cannot forget that basic science is a building block for scientific innovation and economic growth in the information age nevertheless as is a frequent occurrence in science a general hypothesis was constructed from a few specific instances of a phenomenon when i was a kid i loved the curse of frankenstein the creeping unknown x the unknown i love forbidden planet the thing from another world they were science fictionhorror movies generally fracking is doable if theres full disclosure of all chemicals used secondly science dictates the policy rather than politics third theres collaboration between environmental groups and the natural gas industry that the way to achieve higher standards of living for all is through science and technology taking advantage of better tools methods and organization 1988 i also received from the city of vienna the cross of honour for art and science these titles and the various honors mean a great deal to me most of all for the reason that they would mean a great deal to my parents too i think junior is certainly a science fiction premise as is twins as is dave beyond ghostbusters id always been a science fiction enthusiast ive always been a fan of science fiction films and ive never been able to put my particular spin on it galileo was no idiot only an idiot could believe that science requires martyrdom  that may be necessary in religion but in time a scientific result will establish itself how thoroughly it is ingrained in mathematical science that every real advance goes hand in hand with the invention of sharper tools and simpler methods which at the same time assist in understanding earlier theories and in casting aside some more complicated developments the further a mathematical theory is developed the more harmoniously and uniformly does its construction proceed and unsuspected relations are disclosed between hitherto separated branches of the science mathematical science is in my opinion an indivisible whole an organism whose vitality is conditioned upon the connection of its parts i read popular mechanics popular science readers digest i read some responsible journalism and from that i form my own opinions i also happen to be intelligent and i question everything id always wanted the show to be more reality based science fiction something along the lines of the day the earth stood still which i consider to be the classic science fiction film math is sometimes called the science of patterns i felt that chess is a science in the form of a game i consider myself a scientist i wanted to be treated like a scientist i believe that science fiction is as profound as you want it to be or it can be very simple entertainment and im all for very simple entertainment every now and then we all need to come home vegout watch something and not think too deeply about it its what you want it to be we tend to steer clear of being pedantic its entertainment first otherwise wed be on a lecture circuit it does not just happen it is disclosed by science that practically onehalf of trained intellectual resources are being mobilized for murderous purposes there are so many stories to tell in the worlds of science fiction the worlds of fantasy and horror that to confine yourself to even doing historical revisionist fiction whatever you want to call it  mashups gimmick lit absurdist fiction  i dont know if i want to do that anymore we in science are spoiled by the success of mathematics mathematics is the study of problems so simple that they have good solutions if you publish a scientific paper it is very hard to start a nationwide debate about something if you do this in a movie you can start a debate we like to create a bridge between those two worlds  film and science so one reason the science educators panic at the first sign of public rebellion is that they fear exposure of the implicit religious content in what they are teaching as it turns out what looks like science sometimes is not some theists in evolutionary science acquiesce to these tacit rules and retain a personal faith while accepting a thoroughly naturalistic picture of physical reality science is based on the possibility of objectivity on the possibility of different people checking out for themselves the observations made by others without that possibility there is no empirical principle capable of deciding between different arguments and theories in short it is not that evolutionary naturalists have been less brazen than the scientific creationists in holding science hostage but rather that they have been infinitely more effective in getting away with it science by itself has no moral dimension but it does seek to establish truth and upon this truth morality can be built no doubt it is true that science cannot study god but it hardly follows that god had to keep a safe distance from everything that scientists want to study the assumption that nature is all there is and that nature has been governed by the same rules at all times and places makes it possible for natural science to be confident that it can explain such things as how life began if modernist naturalism were true there would be no objective truth outside of science in that case right and wrong would be a matter of cultural preference or political power and the power already available to modernists ideologies would be overwhelming the problem with allowing god a role in the history of life is not that science would cease but rather that scientists would have to acknowledge the existence of something important which is outside the boundaries of natural science the monopoly of science in the realm of knowledge explains why evolutionary biologists do not find it meaningful to address the question whether the darwinian theory is true since coming to congress i have been advocating for increased resources for research in the physical sciences and for the department of energy office of science in particular as the nations primary supporter of research in the physical sciences the doe office of science led the way in creating a unique system of largescale specialized often oneofakind facilities for scientific discovery i meant exactly what i said that we are saddled with a culture that hasnt advanced as far as science scientific prayer makes god a celestial lab rat leading to bad science and worse religion but there is only one surefire method of proper pattern recognition and that is science anecdotal thinking comes naturally science requires training we know evolution happened because innumerable bits of data from myriad fields of science conjoin to paint a rich portrait of lifes pilgrimage but the power of science lies in open publication which with the rise of the internet is no longer constrained by the price of paper rocket science has been mythologized all out of proportion to its true difficulty there are relatively few science fiction or fantasy books with the main character being an old person i dislike literary jargon and never use it criticism has only one function and that is to help readers read and understand literature it is not a science it is an aid to art one of my degrees was a science degree in biology i was horrible at science and math i couldnt pass a test to save my life im surprised that it didnt take me until i was 20 to graduate thats why my role is so cool  grissom is the complete opposite of me my personal feeling about science fiction is that its always in some way connected to the real world to our everyday world we do a hard fantasy as well as hard science fiction and i think i probably singlehandedly recreated military science fiction it was dead before i started working in it it may be far in the future but theres some kind of logical way to get from where we are to where the science fiction is i started in this racket in the early 70s and when i was president of the science fiction writers of america of which i was like the sixth president i was the first one nobody ever heard of all the mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical laws and laws of numbers so that the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of nature to the determination of quantities by operations with numbers in my family as in most middleclass indian families i knew when i was growing up science and mathematics were held in awe weve established a washington state academy of sciences that will enable us to make decisions based on science about what is right for our state meaning the quality of our lives will get better i was really bright as a kid and tested well and it was clear that i was going to get scholarships to any schools i wanted my dad always said i could be an engineer at that time it was the elite of society steady job working in science which was then the answer to every problem we had it was kind of a mandate kind of a dream he had for me im crazy about grant his character his nature his science in fighting and everything else but i dont like the idea that he never accepted the blame for anything always found someone else to blame for any mistake that was ever made including blaming prentiss for shiloh if cooperation is thus the lifeblood of science and technology it is similarly vital to society as a whole theyve also asked me now to start on another series that were gonna do after this frontier earth but its not science fiction its more in the mystery and crime division and thats another area im very interested in human relations are built on feeling not on reason or knowledge and feeling is not an exact science like all spiritual qualities it has the vagueness of greatness about it science almost from its beginnings has been truly international in character national prejudices disappear completely in the scientists search for truth if you look at the purported dangers of salt or fat there is no consensus of support in scientific literature so i would ask first is it possible to have an informed government that actually follows the science from what ive seen its not likely i do love science fiction but its not really a genre unto itself it always seems to merge with another genre with the few movies ive done ive ended up playing with genre in some way or another so any genre thats made to mix with others is like candy to me it allows you to use big mythic situations to talk about ordinary things a third ideal that has made its way in the modern world is reliance on reason especially reason disciplined and enriched by modern science an eternal basis of human intercommunication is reason it is characteristic of science that the full explanations are often seized in their essence by the percipient scientist long in advance of any possible proof the recognition of the art that informs all pure science need not mean the abandonment for it of all present art rather it will mean the completion of the transformation of art that has already begun the relevance of marxism to science is that it removes it from its imagined position of complete detachment and shows it as a part but a critically important part of economy and social development we must always emphasize research and development of science and mathematics and i can think of no better way to achieve this than through our future in space science fiction is no more written for scientists that ghost stories are written for ghosts i sort of was good at writing essays i was never very good at mathematics and i was never very good at algebra i loved science but i wasnt sure of it whenever you deal with science fiction you are setting up a world of rules i think you work hard to establish the rules and you also have to work even harder to maintain those rules and within that find excitement and unpredictability and all that stuff
