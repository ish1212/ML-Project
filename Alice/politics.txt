let us not seek the republican answer or the democratic answer but the right answer let us not seek to fix the blame for the past let us accept our own responsibility for the future suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of congress but i repeat myself one of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors if you put the federal government in charge of the sahara desert in 5 years thered be a shortage of sand it is enough that the people know there was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything it is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness i am extraordinarily patient provided i get my own way in the end if you have ten thousand regulations you destroy all respect for the law healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary democracy is when the indigent and not the men of property are the rulers politics is not a game it is an earnest business whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices a rottenness begins in his conduct the good news is that according to the obama administration the rich will pay for everything the bad news is that according to the obama administration youre rich principles have no real force except when one is wellfed a conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who however has never learned how to walk forward if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal if you have always believed that everyone should play by the same rules and be judged by the same standards that would have gotten you labeled a radical 60 years ago a liberal 30 years ago and a racist today if the united states of america or britain is having elections they dont ask for observers from africa or from asia but when we have elections they want observers always vote for principle though you may vote alone and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost a fool and his money are soon elected in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican i have no ambition to govern men it is a painful and thankless office politics have no relation to morals those who stand for nothing fall for anything perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all the democrats are the party that says government will make you smarter taller richer and remove the crabgrass on your lawn the republicans are the party that says government doesnt work and then they get elected and prove it inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man my brother bob doesnt want to be in government  he promised dad hed go straight the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis politics has become so expensive that it takes a lot of money even to be defeated life without liberty is like a body without spirit politicians also have no leisure because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself power and glory or happiness i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts a free america means just this individual freedom for all rich or poor or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it only government can take perfectly good paper cover it with perfectly good ink and make the combination worthless hell i never vote for anybody i always vote against a healthy democracy requires a decent society it requires that we are honorable generous tolerant and respectful i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them a leader in the democratic party is a boss in the republican party he is a leader politics a strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles the conduct of public affairs for private advantage there aint no answer there aint gonna be any answer there never has been an answer thats the answer conservatism has had from its inception vigorously positive intellectually rigorous agenda and thinking that agenda should have in my three pillars strengthen the economy strengthen our security and strengthen our families conservative n a statesman who is enamored of existing evils as distinguished from the liberal who wishes to replace them with others whenever men take the law into their own hands the loser is the law and when the law loses freedom languishes we would all like to vote for the best man but he is never a candidate when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle ninety percent of the politicians give the other ten percent a bad reputation a liberal is a man or a woman or a child who looks forward to a better day a more tranquil night and a bright infinite future any american who is prepared to run for president should automatically by definition be disqualified from ever doing so bad politicians are sent to washington by good people who dont vote we hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office i love power but it is as an artist that i love it i love it as a musician loves his violin to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies in politics the middle way is none at all you want a friend in washington get a dog the successful revolutionary is a statesman the unsuccessful one a criminal conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives instead of giving a politician the keys to the city it might be better to change the locks tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes our ancestors it is the democracy of the dead tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around there are many men of principle in both parties in america but there is no party of principle all the president is is a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering kissing and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway a diplomat is a person who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that you actually look forward to the trip the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death when buying and selling are controlled by legislation the first things to be bought and sold are legislators he who knows how to flatter also knows how to slander i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue apparently a democracy is a place where numerous elections are held at great cost without issues and with interchangeable candidates politics it seems to me for years or all too long has been concerned with right or left instead of right or wrong half of the american people have never read a newspaper half never voted for president one hopes it is the same half radical changes in world politics leave america with a heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a genuinely free democratic just and humane society hell hath no fury like a bureaucrat scorned an idea not coupled with action will never get any bigger than the brain cell it occupied power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely republicans are men of narrow vision who are afraid of the future pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting we allow them to disperse because weve been ignorant of their value it is not in the nature of politics that the best men should be elected the best men do not want to govern their fellowmen oh that lovely title expresident democracy is being allowed to vote for the candidate you dislike least a liberal is a man who is willing to spend somebody elses money one of the reasons people hate politics is that truth is rarely a politicians objective election and power are republicans have nothing but bad ideas and democrats have no ideas in politics nothing is contemptible in most places in the country voting is looked upon as a right and a duty but in chicago its a sport if we desire respect for the law we must first make the law respectable i know many writers who first dictate passages then polish what they have dictated i speak then i polish  occasionally i do windows when i was a boy i was told that anybody could become president im beginning to believe it americas present need is not heroics but healing not nostrums but normalcy not revolution but restoration the activist is not the man who says the river is dirty the activist is the man who cleans up the river our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control mens minds for every talent that poverty has stimulated it has blighted a hundred you may think the president is allpowerful but he is not he needs a lot of guidance from the lord politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable you cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt liberalism is i think resurgent one reason is that more and more people are so painfully aware of the alternative in order to become the master the politician poses as the servant when one may pay out over two million dollars to presidential and congressional campaigns the us government is virtually up for sale a conservative is a man who just sits and thinks mostly sits the end move in politics is always to pick up a gun do you ever get the feeling that the only reason we have elections is to find out if the polls were right i have long enjoyed the friendship and companionship of republicans because i am by instinct a teacher and i would like to teach them something every man who repeats the dogma of mill that one country is no fit to rule another country must admit that one class is not fit to rule another class if nominated i will not run if elected i will not serve the idea that you can merchandise candidates for high office like breakfast cereal  that you can gather votes like box tops  is i think the ultimate indignity to the democratic process liberalism is trust of the people tempered by prudence conservatism is distrust of the people tempered by fear a politician will do anything to keep his job  even become a patriot if you dont like the president it costs you 90 bucks to fly to washington to picket if you dont like the governor it costs you 60 bucks to fly to albany to picket if you dont like me 90 cents the secret of getting things done is to act a conservative is someone who makes no changes and consults his grandmother when in doubt democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one the only difference between the democrats and the republicans is that the democrats allow the poor to be corrupt too free speech is not to be regulated like diseased cattle and impure butter the audience that hissed yesterday may applaud today even for the same performance as you make your bed so you must lie in it i think its a terrible shame that politics has become show business i have a fantasy where ted turner is elected president but refuses because he doesnt want to give up power vote for the man who promises least hell be the least disappointing politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed no real social change has ever been brought about without a revolution revolution is but thought carried into action politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians a war for a great principle ennobles a nation the revolution is a dictatorship of the exploited against the exploiters turn on to politics or politics will turn on you every politician should have been born an orphan and remain a bachelor many politicians are in the habit of laying it down as a selfevident proposition that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom the maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim the flood of money that gushes into politics today is a pollution of democracy freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be the revenues of cuban staterun companies are used exclusively for the benefit of the people to whom they belong reporters thrive on the worlds misfortune for this reason they often take an indecent pleasure in events that dismay the rest of humanity the world is governed by opinion the beef industry has contributed to more american deaths than all the wars of this century all natural disasters and all automobile accidents combined a conservative is one who admires radicals centuries after theyre dead the most important political office is that of the private citizen in politics it is necessary either to betray ones country or the electorate i prefer to betray the electorate i do have a political agenda its to have as few regulations as possible the thing i enjoyed most were visits from children they did not want public office justice sir is the great interest of man on earth it is the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations together it is a measure of the framers fear that a passing majority might find it expedient to compromise 4th amendment values that these values were embodied in the constitution itself if you are going to sin sin against god not the bureaucracy god will forgive you but the bureaucracy wont conservatives define themselves in terms of what they oppose i should prefer to have a politician who regularly went to a massage parlour than one who promised a laptop computer for every teacher the largest party in america by the way is neither the democrats nor the republicans its the party of nonvoters in politics what begins in fear usually ends in failure i can remember when democrats believed that it was the duty of america to fight for freedom over tyranny you have not converted a man because you have silenced him the first resistance to social change is to say its not necessary the vicepresidency is sort of like the last cookie on the plate everybody insists he wont take it but somebody always does voters dont decide issues they decide who will decide issues the world will never have lasting peace so long as men reserve for war the finest human qualities peace no less than war requires idealism and selfsacrifice and a righteous and dynamic faith the politicians were talking themselves red white and blue in the face when they see me holding fish they can see that i am comfortable with kings as well as with paupers the united states brags about its political system but the president says one thing during the election something else when he takes office something else at midterm and something else when he leaves ive been to war and its not easy to kill its bloody and messy and totally horrifying and the consequences are serious my hope is that 10 years from now after ive been across the street at work for a while theyll all be glad they gave me that wonderful vote it is difficult to discern a serious threat to religious liberty from a room of silent thoughtful schoolchildren sensible and responsible women do not want to vote the relative positions to be assumed by man and woman in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence than ours he too serves a certain purpose who only stands and cheers the more i see of the representatives of the people the more i admire my dogs so long as we have enough people in this country willing to fight for their rights well be called a democracy confronted with the choice the american people would choose the policemans truncheon over the anarchists bomb they say women talk too much if you have worked in congress you know that the filibuster was invented by men when governments become large voters cannot exercise close oversight otherwise known as political power voting is a civic sacrament in a democracy dissent is an act of faith i was a woman in a mans world i was a democrat in a republican administration i was an intellectual in a world of bureaucrats i talked differently this may have made me a bit like an ink blot their very conservatism is secondhand and they dont know what they are conserving when the body of the people is possessed of the supreme power it is called a democracy your every voter as surely as your chief magistrate exercises a public trust it is our experience that political leaders do not always mean the opposite of what they say and after i make a lot of money ill be able to afford running for office i always voted at my partys call and i never thought of thinking for myself at all i cant let important policy decisions hinge on the fact that an election is coming up every 90 days what politicians want to create is irreversible change because when you leave office someone changes it back again we have i fear confused power with greatness frankly i dont mind not being president i just mind that someone else is i think there is one higher office than president and i would call that patriot if a politician murders his mother the first response of the press or of his opponents will likely be not that it was a terrible thing to do but rather that in a statement made six years before he had gone on record as being opposed to matricide we live in a world in which politics has replaced philosophy you better take advantage of the good cigars you dont get much else in that job after much prayerful consideration i feel that i must say i have climbed my last political mountain our party is a diverse one as is my home state of illinois you know they say the most dangerous person of the world is a member of the united states congress just home from a threeday factfinding trip it has been well said that a hungry man is more interested in four sandwiches than four freedoms television is democracy at its ugliest i never considered a difference of opinion in politics in religion in philosophy as cause for withdrawing from a friend politics is the art of looking for trouble finding it everywhere diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies politics is for the present but an equation is for eternity it has been said that politics is the second oldest profession i have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again what i have done since then is pretty well known politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow next week next month and next year and to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didnt happen politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous in war you can only be killed once but in politics many times in war you can only be killed once but in politics many times i am never going to have anything more to do with politics or politicians when this war is over i shall confine myself entirely to writing and painting politics are very much like war we may even have to use poison gas at times those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is in politics nothing happens by accident if it happens you can bet it was planned that way politics is such a torment that i advise everyone i love not to mix with it sometimes i wonder if we shall ever grow up in our politics and say definite things which mean something or whether we shall always go on using generalities to which everyone can subscribe and which mean very little politics i supposed to be the secondoldest profession i have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first politics is not a bad profession if you succeed there are many rewards if you disgrace yourself you can always write a book politics is just like show business you have a hell of an opening coast for a while and then have a hell of a close a typical vice of american politics is the avoidance of saying anything real on real issues politics is like football if you see daylight go through the hole im always rather nervous about how you talk about women who are active in politics whether they want to be talked about as women or as politicians therefore the good of man must be the end of the science of politics politics is the art of controlling your environment in the end thats what this election is about do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope poetry is about the grief politics is about the grievance the more you observe politics the more youve got to admit that each party is worse than the other in politics stupidity is not a handicap what englishman will give his mind to politics as long as he can afford to keep a motor car i must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy the most practical kind of politics is the politics of decency the first lesson of economics is scarcity there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it the first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics if you ever injected truth into politics you have no politics before i went to jail i was active in politics as a member of south africas leading organization  and i was generally busy from 7 am until midnight i never had time to sit and think in our age there is no such thing as keeping out of politics all issues are political issues and politics itself is a mass of lies evasions folly hatred and schizophrenia there is no more independence in politics than there is in jail there is probably a perverse pride in my administration that we were going to do the right thing even if shortterm it was unpopular and i think anybody whos occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you cant be neglecting of marketing and pr and public opinion like religion politics and family planning cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public its too controversial the trouble with nixon is that hes a serious politics junkie hes totally hooked and like any other junkie hes a bummer to have around especially as president part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because were hardwired not to always think clearly when were scared and the countrys scared after you have exhausted what there is in business politics conviviality and so on  have found that none of these finally satisfy or permanently wear  what remains nature remains politics is applesauce few businessmen are capable of being in politics they dont understand the democratic process they have neither the tolerance or the depth it takes democracy isnt a business politics doesnt make strange bedfellows  marriage does i hate all politics i dont like either political party one should not belong to them  one should be an individual standing in the middle anyone that belongs to a party stops thinking freedom isnt free it shouldnt be a bragging point that oh i dont get involved in politics as if that makes someone cleaner no that makes you derelict of duty in a republic liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didnt insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable the most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own the central conservative truth is that it is culture not politics that determines the success of a society the central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself these things will destroy the human race politics without principle progress without compassion wealth without work learning without silence religion without fearlessness and worship without awareness politics ought to be the parttime profession of every citizen who would protect the rights and privileges of free people and who would preserve what is good and fruitful in our national heritage i am in politics because of the conflict between good and evil and i believe that in the end good will triumph there are still people in my party who believe in consensus politics i regard them as quislings as traitors i mean it politics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is thought necessary the country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy we have to offer an alternative vision to err is human to blame someone else is politics one of the things being in politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned or reasonable sex in politics never retreat never retract never admit a mistake politics is the entertainment branch of industry i havent been very active in politics i think that you can disagree with people and debate over their positions with issues without engaging in the politics of personal destruction it is a vain hope to make people happy by politics anyone who thinks that the vicepresident can take a position independent of the president of his administration simply has no knowledge of politics or government you are his choice in a political marriage and he expects your absolute loyalty at the bottom of education at the bottom of politics even at the bottom of religion there must be for our race economic independence in politics as in religion it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution we need more of the office desk and less of the show window in politics let men in office substitute the midnight oil for the limelight one of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace good people dont go into government alliance  in international politics the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each others pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third i dont think politics has anything to do with left right or center it has to do with trying to do right by people revolution n in politics an abrupt change in the form of misgovernment i learnt more about politics during one south dakota dust storm than in seven years at the university we believe that to err is human to blame it on someone else is politics i must not write a word to you about politics because you are a woman if everybody in this town connected with politics had to leave town because of chasing women and drinking you would have no government im not an old experienced hand at politics but i am now seasoned enough to have learned that the hardest thing about any political campaign is how to win without proving that you are unworthy of winning the challenge is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible in every country today there is politics it may be authoritarian politics but there is politics i was in civil society long before i was ever in politics or my husband was ever even elected president there is no act of treachery or meanness of which a political party is not capable for in politics there is no honour if you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics  a creed from which you yourself cannot expect to draw any material advantage  surely that proves that you are in the right i am an anglocatholic in religion a classicist in literature and a royalist in politics what is a wife and what is a harlot what is a church and what is a theatre are they two and not one can they exist separate are not religion and politics the same thing brotherhood is religion o demonstrations of reason dividing families in cruelty and pride when you are in any contest you should work as if there were  to the very last minute  a chance to lose it this is battle this is politics this is anything half a truth is better than no politics consul  in american politics a person who having failed to secure an office from the people is given one by the administration on condition that he leave the country politics is a profession a serious complicated and in its true sense a noble one establishing lasting peace is the work of education all politics can do is keep us out of war politics will eventually be replaced by imagery the politician will be only too happy to abdicate in favor of his image because the image will be much more powerful than he could ever be office politics are bloodyminded but weak on content politics is an act of faith you have to show some kind of confidence in the intellectual and moral capacity of the public my objection to liberalism is this that it is the introduction into the practical business of life of the highest kind namely politics of philosophical ideas instead of political principles politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom and a great empire and little minds go ill together there are no morals in politics there is only expedience a scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel war has rules mud wrestling has rules  politics has no rules only very intelligent people dont wish they were in politics and im dumb enough to want to be in there compromise makes a good umbrella but a poor roof it is temporary expedient often wise in party politics almost sure to be unwise in statesmanship finality is not the language of politics real politics are the possession and distribution of power politics is a science you can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong in politics shared hatreds are almost always the basis of friendships politics begin where the masses are not where there are thousands but where there are millions that is where serious politics begin there is no gambling like politics king louis philippe once said to me that he attributed the great success of the british nation in political life to their talking politics after dinner the practice of politics in the east may be defined by one word dissimulation to rely upon conviction devotion and other excellent spiritual qualities that is not to be taken seriously in politics i think one of the great problems we have in the republican party is that we dont encourage you to be nasty we encourage you to be neat obedient loyal and faithful and all those boy scout words which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics ideology politics and journalism which luxuriate in failure are impotent in the face of hope and joy fiscal conservatism is just an easy way to express something that is a bit more difficult which is that the size and scope of government and really the size and scope of politics in our lives has grown uncomfortable unwieldy intrusive and inefficient the world of american politics is more contentious than it has ever been in my lifetime to those who have exhausted politics nothing remains but abstract thought a politics that is not sensitive to the concerns and circumstances of peoples lives a politics that does not speak to and include people is an intellectually arrogant politics that deserves to fail when times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain the politics of constant conflict may be good but what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world what works in the real world is cooperation war should be the politics of last resort and when we go to war we should have a purpose that our people understand and support you begin saving the world by saving one man at a time all else is grandiose romanticism or politics when we are sick we want an uncommon doctor when we have a construction job to do we want an uncommon engineer and when we are at war we want an uncommon general it is only when we get into politics that we are satisfied with the common man forget sex or politics or religion loneliness is the subject that clears out a room by 2000 politics will simply fade away we will not see any political parties politics is the diversion of trivial men who when they succeed at it become important in the eyes of more trivial men politics are for foreigners with their endless wrongs and paltry rights politics are a lousy way to get things done politics are like gods infinite mercy a last resort politics is not bean bags its serious tough stuff you cant be in politics unless you can walk in a room and know in a minute whos for you and whos against you just because you do not take an interest in politics doesnt mean politics wont take an interest in you first i think more americans need to declare their independence from partisan politics on both sides the more that americans declare their independence the more the parties will have to compete for their votes using reason rather than the hateful appeals university politics are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small nothing is so admirable in politics as a short memory if youre sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and principles come and join this campaign i guess youd call me an independent since ive never identified myself with one party or another in politics i always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as i can at the actual candidates and issues themselves no matter what the party label i have no consistency except in politics and that probably arises from my indifference to the subject altogether from politics it was an easy step to silence i have come to the conclusion that politics are too serious a matter to be left to the politicians as a black woman my politics and political affiliation are bound up with and flow from participation in my peoples struggle for liberation and with the fight of oppressed people all over the world against american imperialism weve switched from a culture that was interested in manufacturing economics politics  trying to play a serious part in the world  to a culture thats really entertainmentbased the sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world politics isnt about big money or power games its about the improvement of peoples lives there is no sea more dangerous than the ocean of practical politics none in which there is more need of good pilotage and of a single unfaltering purpose when the waves rise high i think politicians get hamstrung by the nature of politics when the private sector can really do great things politics is not the art of the possible it consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable there are times in politics when you must be on the right side and lose in politics strangely enough the best way to play your cards is to lay them face upwards on the table politics in a literary work is like a gun shot in the middle of a concert something vulgar and however something which is impossible to ignore a lot of women these days a lot of young women dont want to call themselves feminists you have this cheap hideous girl power sort of fad which i think is pretty benign at best but at worst i think its a way of taking the politics out of feminism and making it some kind of fashion politics as the word is commonly understood are nothing but corruptions politics would be a helluva good business if it werent for the goddamned people politics are not the task of a christian the advantage of the internet is that it has taken away the charade of politics china has heard of democracy and people know about certain concepts they wouldnt have previously i played by the rules of politics as i found them in pakistan politics is hereditary there are no true friends in politics we are all sharks circling and waiting for traces of blood to appear in the water its like being at the kids table at thanksgiving  you can put your elbows on it you dont have to talk politics no matter how old i get theres always a part of me thats sitting there i reject the cynical view that politics is a dirty business what we won when all of our people united must not be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics accordingly i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as president one lesson you better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never go out on a golf course and beat the president in religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed than for those who deny the whole of it politics i conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself finishing second in the olympics gets you silver finishing second in politics gets you oblivion i seldom think of politics more than eighteen hours a day its really very simple governor when people are hungry they die so spare me your politics and tell me what you need and how youre going to get it to these people i think that people are tired theyre tired of the same old kind of politics people want a new tone to politics first rule of politics you cant win unless youre on the ballot second rule if you run you may lose and if you tie you do not win politics is human beings its addition rather than subtraction in politics every day is filled with numerous opportunities for serious error enjoy it politics is too partisan and sometimes patriotism is cast aside patriotism is honor and love of your country and your brothers and sisters with politics i get the impression that its all about whats good for the party and not necessarily whats good for the country i dont think consensusbuilding politics is what im meant to be doing the advice ive been giving to people all my life  that you may not be interested in the dialectic but the dialectic is interested in you you cant give up politics it wont give you up  was the advice i should have been taking myself the term the american left is as near to being meaningless or nonsensical as any term could really be in politics it isnt really a force in politics anymore and it would do well to ask itself why that is war is the ultimate tool of politics ive always said that an art critic can put aside politics around art politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business i hate politics its slimy any job where people pander for votes i dont like the country has gotten so partisan that if youre not on my side youre the enemy the only thing i ever try to support is a third party like unity08 we need more parties and more choice we need leadership we dont need a doubling down on the failed politics of the past to my great disappointment it appears that the politics of division are making a big comeback many americans share my disappointment  especially those who were filled with great hope a few years ago when thensenator obama announced his candidacy in springfield illinois where there is politics or economics there is no morality i tend to avoid televisions politics and places with velvet ropes a promising young man should go into politics so that he can go on promising for the rest of his life a wise nation should cultivate a political spirit that allows opponents to cooperate without fearing an automatic execution from their core supporters who knew that the real rogues in american politics would be the ones who dare to get along it is easier for women to succeed in business the arts and politics in america than in europe the new freedom of expression brought by the internet goes far beyond politics people relate to each other in new ways posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception and yet there are still people in american politics who for some reason cling to this belief that america is better off adopting the economic policies of nations whose people who immigrate here from there in politics merit is rewarded by the possessor being raised like a target to a position to be fired at my dream of politics all my life has been that it is the common business that it is something we owe to each other to understand and discuss with absolute frankness the democracy gap in our politics and elections spells a deep sense of powerlessness by people who drop out do not vote or listlessly vote for the least worst every four years and then wonder why after every cycle the least worst gets worse they said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics to take on publicsector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy but with bipartisan leadership we saved taxpayers 132 billion dollars over 30 years and saved retirees their pensions we did it nobody likes you know the ugly parts of politics at present our country needs womens idealism and determination perhaps more in politics than anywhere else politics and war are remarkably similar situations no cause is left but the most ancient of all the one in fact that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics the cause of freedom versus tyranny africanamericans who might have disagreed with candidate obamas leftofcenter politics voted for him in 2008 because electing a candidate with brown skin was too historic an opportunity to miss adherents of the new religious right reject the separation of politics and religion but they bring no spiritual insights to politics i voted for barack because he was black cuz thats why other folks vote for other people  because they look like them thats american politics pure and simple i dont think you can work on feelings in politics apart from anything else political change can come very unexpectedly sometimes overnight when you least expect it i dont really like labels in politics but i will gladly accept the label of conservatism the secret of politics make a good treaty with russia a couple of weeks is a long time in american politics i dont know why that is but english politics is just so overly white its very much about the class structure its an honor putting art above politics politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul i detest politics to be honest with you its a cesspool and i dont think i would fare well in that cesspool because i dont believe in political correctness and i certainly dont believe in dishonesty the enemy is not just terrorism it is the threat posed specifically by islamist terrorism by bin ladin and others who draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within a minority strain of islam that does not distinguish politics from religion and distorts both i think that what went wrong with religion is the same thing that went wrong with politics is that it became too money based and too controlling its just a weakness that we human beings have for control  we want one thing and then we want more and then we want more you do the policy ill do the politics life is a corrupting process from the time a child learns to play his mother off against his father in the politics of when to go to bed he who fears corruption fears life it is impossible to practice parliamentary politics without having patience decency politeness and courtesy a dose of humility goes a long way in life and in politics war is not the continuation of politics with different means it is the greatest masscrime perpetrated on the community of man an independent is someone who wants to take the politics out of politics we mean by politics the peoples business  the most important business there is politics disgusts me i never thought of politics as a profession i have never regarded politics as the arena of morals it is the arena of interest ive rarely kept my distance from kind of  i dont know if we can call it politics but kind of civic engagement and that kind of thing except i tended to think well do it yourself before you start telling other people what they should be doing remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band you wore their shirt and sang every word you didnt know anything about scene politics haircuts or what was cool all you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with someone finally understood you this is what music is about i am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature not that i understand what these terms mean but i take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist is there in all the history of human folly a greater fool than a clergymen in politics anythings possible in politics you have to take away some of tax breaks for the wealthy and you have to cut back on some entitlements because unless we do all of these things it just doesnt work and whats good theater and whats good politics isnt necessarily good economic policy the hope of a new politics does not lie in formulating a leftwing reply to the rightit lies in rejecting conventional political categories everybody in america is soft and hates conflict the cure for this both in politics and social life is the same  hardihood give them raw truth democrats always like to brag that their guys are smarter than the opponents and republicans always like to brag that their guys are more moral than the opponents but if youre looking for morals in politics youre looking for bananas in the cheese department in politics women type the letters lick the stamps distribute the pamphlets and get out the vote men get elected never believe anything in politics until it has been officially denied i know im not supposed to have any opinions about politics because im famous politics is organized hatred that is unity finance is a gun politics is knowing when to pull the trigger well judy i would hope in the new year we could start thinking about politics not like it was the super bowl where you always have to have one team that wins and the other team has to be a loser youve got to watch the politics of aids the politics of aids can work both for and against the victims of aids everything is politics i think whats fascinating is how many people are playing in politics who maybe havent played before war is the continuation of politics by other means its a big deal for me to say im over politics because politics rests on an irreducible measure of coercion it can never become a perfect realm of perfect love and justice the first requirement of politics is not intellect or stamina but patience politics is a very long run game and the tortoise will usually beat the hare i think politics is important its how we run our society i think it should be natural to have an interest in the subject and i almost dont understand why some people dont heres a very good rule of thumb in politics losing begets losing this has always been the way of presidential politics the president rises above the fray while his surrogates go on the attack they throw the spears and fling the mud he sits upon the throne obama seemed poised to realign american politics after his stunning 2008 victory but the economy remains worse than even the administrations worstcase scenarios and the long legislative battles over health care reform financial services reform and the national debt and deficit have taken their toll obama no longer looks invincible many individuals are doing what they can but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics when i became leader i made very clear i was not going to choose the easy life i have always taken risks i dont like comfortzone politics politics is just show business for ugly people you cant ignore politics no matter how much youd like to there is in fact no such thing as art for arts sake art that stands above classes art that is detached from or independent of politics proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed i honestly believe that theres an element in this country in our politics that does not want to see a businessman succeed at getting the nomination for the republican party and does not want me to succeed at becoming president of the united states of america one of the things that i think you see sometimes in politics is a certain degree of caution its usually advised by consultants who dont want to see you march to the end of a limb we discussed politics but we also talked about the importance of hard work personal responsibility living within your means keeping your word those lessons stay with you throughout your life the world of politics is always twenty years behind the world of thought i think that politics could be a positive thing my beef is that people focus on the personal aspect of a politician too much they should focus on the results no science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power im not a politician and dont want any part of politics our politics are our deepest form of expression they mirror our past experiences and reflect our dreams and aspirations for the future politics is about the improvement of peoples lives its about advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and the world politics is about doing well for the people politics is the art of the possible creativity is the art of the impossible politics is repetition it is not change change is something beyond what we call politics change is the essence politics is supposed to be the means to bring into being i think politics come out of psychology the politics of partisanship and the resulting inaction and excuses have paralyzed decisionmaking primarily at the federal level and the big issues of the day are not being addressed leaving our future in jeopardy and you dont want to always write about politics just for the sake of writing about politics the message that i gave on the  on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual believe in the power of one person dont believe that you cant do it everybody wants  everybody wants a shot that we can all agree on beyond that it becomes politics im not talking politics i dont fancy myself a political commentator i hate politics i hate it in government you carry each hope each disillusion and in politics its always about the next challenge you know the media and politicians are always gonna be in a bit of tension with one another and probably most of the time thats healthy and indeed even creative but its where  its really when news organisations are used as kind of instruments of politics that it gets tricky i never have been involved in politics i believe in the separation of church and state but i do not believe in the separation of politics from religion you cannot mix sports with politics the world we build tomorrow is born in the stories we tell our children today politics moves the pieces education changes the game i dont follow politics much if acknowledging that racial misgivings and misunderstandings are still a part of politics and life in america i plead guilty by nominating chuck hagel to be his defense secretary president obama is putting forward an aloof contrarian who doesnt suffer fools  a striving politician who considers himself above politics ive been leading newsrooms for a while now and its been an honor serving as editor in chief of nj but i really think that my best shot at moving the needle in politics is by getting close to it  by reading reporting tweeting and writing politics exist in the boardroom as well politics is the womb in which war develops i think things changed as a result of a certain perception of our politics when we went through our zealous selfrighteous period it didnt exactly win us any friends politics is not really my thing flipping the dial through available radio stations there will blare out to any listener an array of broadcasts 247 propagating religious right politics along with what they deem to be oldtime gospel preaching this is especially true of what comes over the airwaves in bible belt southern states when times are tough constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world cooperation works better after all nobodys right all the time and a broken clock is right twice a day politics is the conspiracy of the unproductive but organized against the productive but unorganized in politics people give you what they think you deserve and deny you what they think you want these days politics religion media seem to get all mixed up television became the new religion a long time back and the media has taken over politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the right reason is to challenge the status quo to serve the common good and to leave this nation better than we found it every two years the american politics industry fills the airwaves with the most virulent scurrilous walltowall character assassination of nearly every political practitioner in the country  and then declares itself puzzled that america has lost trust in its politicians as women have played an increasingly important role in politics there is no question that theyve brought a different perspective focusing attention on a broader set of issues and building alliances with other women it isnt fate but fecklessness that has shoved sarah palin to the sidelines of national politics the real tragedy is that shes taken a lot of other serious republican women with her when i first started working in politics as a junior aide on walter mondales 1984 presidential campaign it never occurred to me that i would one day work in the white house there were plenty of women among the volunteers who stuffed envelopes and walked precincts but there were fewer and fewer on each successive level of influence and access after i left the white house i kept a foothold in the business of american politics as a talkshow host analyst commentator speechmaker and occasional writer i was no longer a practitioner but i was still a partisan a democrat a bluestater through and through im not in politics after all is said that can be said upon the liquor traffic its influence is degrading upon the individual the family politics and business and upon everything that you touch in this old world ferdinand was a gold trader he was a lawyer for mining companies when he entered politics in l949 he had tons and tons of gold when bill gates was a college dropout ferdinand already possessed billions of dollars and tons of gold it wasnt stolen there are few things in politics more annoying than the rights utter conviction that it owns the patent on the word freedom that when its leaders stand up for the rights of banks to be unregulated or capital gains to be untaxed that it is actually and obviously standing up for human liberty the noblest cause of them all this aesthetic quality then is what politics is all about its authenticity that separates winners from losers good politics from bad and heman leadertypes from consultantdirected puppetboys acknowledging class was always difficult for new democrats  it was secondwave it was divisive  but 2008 made retro politics cool again i like to see myself as a bridge builder that is me building bridges between people between races between cultures between politics trying to find common ground i do not believe that artists or actors and people should be out there like voicing their fullblown opinions on politics because lets face it at the end of the day im not that smart of a guy i can tell you that too much money is corrupting american politics dont blame the american public the us supreme court has a lot to answer for because it has made it impossible for congress to reduce the corrupting influence of money on american political life i think in politics in congress you often do things that are republican or you do things because youre a democrat sometimes thats good obviously and sometimes thats obviously bad but in the news business theres no such thing as republican or democratic news news is news im looking forward to the day when america will mature to the point that we are a colorblind society im not so sure that in politics that will ever be reality because politics has a way of separating us based on skin color when a cabinet minister who is sacked for telling lies is reappointed in the face of every constitutional convention only for the same man to be sacked again from the same cabinet for the same offence by the same prime minister no wonder the public are cynical about politics politics is the only field in which the more experience you have the worse you get in politics an organized minority is a political majority everyone wants to demagogue everyone else that may be good politics but its awful policy i dont compromise my principles for politics i came back from university thinking i knew all about politics and racism not knowing my dad had been one of the youngestserving labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in south africa years ago because of the situation there and hes never mentioned it  you just find out thats a real man to me a sleeping lion i am a sportsman and not a politician i am a sportsman and will always remain one i am not going to enter politics giving up cricket which is my life i will continue to play cricket without alienation there can be no politics it would be great if politics were factbased but it is not and it is surely not nuancebased what works in a classroom or a think tank does not work on capitol hill or in the white house obama sometimes seems to be running the brookings institution not the country while we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith our politics and our culture are in the main less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly christian character than they were even five years ago i think this is a good thing  good for our political culture once the cry and the cause of a generation of progressives to make america safer fairer and cleaner regulation is now a dirty word in our politics even democrats are quick to talk about cutting regulations republicans hate them with  how to put it  evangelical fervor whether one believes or not religion is as real a force in the life of the world as economics or politics and it demands fairminded attention even if you think the entire religious enterprise is at best misguided and at worst counterproductive it remains vital inspiring great good and sometimes great evil one thing i have frankly decided is that when it comes to political reform we have two conservative parties in british politics both the labour and conservative parties have constantly and repeatedly failed to honour promises they have made about reforming cleaning modernising our clappedout system i didnt come into politics to change the labour party i came into politics to change the country in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy least of all in politics which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight i mean i went to a church school when i was younger and imbibed a certain amount of religion then but it was really in university that i got interested in religion and politics at the same time i dont think as if it were one moment of conversion but my spiritual journey really began then amnesty is a terrible policy and its terrible politics its a terrible policy because you are rewarding people for breaking the law i have some very personal feelings about politics but i dont get into it because i do comedy already when applied to politics and taken to its extreme kitsch is the mask of death fascism was all aesthetics there was no core principle to it there was no truth to it and im not apolitical  im very specific in my politics but a lot of the time its nobodys business unless youre over at my house having dinner to work in architecture you are so much involved with society with politics with bureaucrats its a very complicated process to do large projects you start to see the society how it functions how it works then you have a lot of criticism about how it works i have never found in a long experience of politics that criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance war is not an independent phenomenon but the continuation of politics by different means with participation in politics so low at the moment i think christians should ensure their views are represented at all levels and not leave it to others telling the truth and confronting the challenge is what politics is about in politics yesterdays lie is attacked only to flatter todays what drew me to politics in the first place was the fact that i wanted to have a place to take a stand and use my voice to express what i believed in but ive no longer got any political aspirations i feel that as a politician fifty per cent of people would hate you before you even left the house my mother lillie specter was an angel and totally uninterested in politics pennsylvania is a very tough state people dont last long in pennsylvania politics the proper reply to right wing religiosity is not to insist that politics and religion dont mix this is the stock response of the left it is money money money not ideas not principles but money that reigns supreme in american politics the days when the words hollywood actor framed ronald reagan like bunny fingers as an id tag and an implied insult seem faroff and quaint nearly everybody in politics  candidate consultant pundit and tea party crowd extra alike  is an actor now a shameless ham in a hokedup reality series that never stops idealism is the despot of thought just as politics is the despot of will politics as a practice whatever its professions has always been the systematic organization of hatreds politics are a very unsatisfactory game practical politics consists in ignoring facts politics as a practise whatever its professions has always been the systematic organization of hatreds politics have always been the systematic organization of hatreds skip the religion and politics head straight to the compassion everything else is a distraction i believe people who go into politics want to do the right thing and then they hit a big wall of reelection and the pettiness of politics in the end politics gets in the way of the business of people the lesson of the last year is this foreign policy cant be managed through the politics of personality and our president would do well to take note of an observation john f kennedy made once he was in office  that all of the worlds problems arent his predecessors fault in politics there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers and then there are those like john mccain who use their careers to promote change im not the guy to ask about politics im a gag writer frankly if you do politics you should not be thinking about your dignity we read too much shakespeare at school and view our parliamentary politics as dynastic drama in which an impatient crown prince frets at his long subordination and begins to scheme for the throne he knows he merits was promised and has earned except for politics no business is scrutinized more exhaustively than journalism in politics the people i most despise are those who have no values i try not to spend too much time on partisan politics lifes too short for that i dont really believe that there have been many human problems solved by politics i got politics and economics moving and then others took over politics is a blood sport love is blind my politics has been too i think you can fall in love with ideas and you can fall in love with people its a very subjective experience and im loyal to that experience my shows arent about trying to save some place because i dont feel thats the right venue for it thats my politics right there dont bring politics to my shows you know im just not going to get into american politics i will say that i think israel enjoys strong bipartisan support in the united states its really above and beyond american politics its time to let science and medicine not politics and rhetoric lead us to good sound policy sometimes in politics you think youve seen it all turns out i was wrong a year is an eternity in politics  though less than a moment in history in politics you learn to always smile i do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals it is about ideas in the melting pot that is america inclusive trumps exclusive whether its single women young adults or minorities alienating the rapidly growing voting blocs is not smart politics i think president obama could have handled politics and policies differently but he has been decisive strong and consistent  important qualities in a president mitt romney is indeed an etch a sketch the antithesis of leadership why does it have to be politics is there a dynamism to that world and a theoretical capacity to do things that draws many talented people absolutely are there other ways to be involved and lead an interesting life of course yet it ought to be obvious that good music generally occupies a higher plane that mere politics great writers can express moods through melody and capture experiences we share most powerfully  love lust longing joy rage fear triumph yearning and confusion the science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past the record of truths revealed by experience is eminently practical as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future good policy makes good politics and what ive done has been good politics i never got into politics for it to be a career i never got into politics for it to be a career it doesnt take a lot of strength to hang on it takes a lot of strength to let go i guess probably in my time in politics it continued to be affirmed to me that the africanamerican community despite being subscription televisions most valuable customers they are very underserved by cable and satellite television programming options im not driven to get back into politics its not on my top five things to do before i die but saying that i may be in politics in the next year or the next ten years ive been on the front line for 12 years four in state government eight on the national level we need to remember that politics is all about people not programs we shouldnt want to take the humanness out of the political arena growing up in politics i know that women decide all elections because we do all the work politics is not an exact science most people dont want to talk about politics and religion they say lets talk about something else i dont believe your soul mate has to share your politics i dont like to talk about things where youre going to gt one side or the other unhappy my music has no politics those who write the editorials and those who write the columns they simply are unaccountable theyre free to impose their cultural politics in the name of freedom of the press its not that im universally loved we know im not in new jersey but what they do say in new jersey is we like him and we think hes telling us the truth i think we need to have that type of politics on the national level i want to stay away from politics or else ill probably end up putting my size fifteen foot into my mouth for a person who promised hope and civility in politics mr obama has shown a borderline obsessiveness in blaming mr bush you realize that for all the shenanigans that go on in the big circus of politics everybody wakes up and goes to work politics has less to do with where you live than where your heart is i was in elective politics for 24 years ive made four national races two for president two for vice president i have found there are other ways to serve and im enjoying them one of the big changes in politics has been because families individuals have felt worried insecure worried about the economy worried about their jobs worried about their kids futures actually the disconnect between the public and media discourse and peoples everyday concerns has become bigger not smaller we live in a stage of politics where legislators seem to regard the passage of laws as much more important than the results of their enforcement for too long we have focused on our differences  in our politics and backgrounds in our race and beliefs  rather than cherishing the unity and pride that binds us together you can study government and politics in school but the best way to really understand the process is to volunteer your time we are losing sight of civility in government and politics debate and dialogue is taking a back seat to the politics of destruction and anger and control dogma has replaced thoughtful discussion between people of differing views while everyone else is thinking about economics and politics executive salaries and the future of the euro do the opposite even if its hard invest in the spirit i dont like politics politics are about preserving relationships at the end of the day and it has nothing to do with the greater good for humanity its just all about business you can rule ignorance you can manipulate the illiterate you can do whatever you want when a people are uneducated so that goes in line with corrupt business and corrupt politics sincerity and competence is a strong combination in politics it is everything george clooneys ides of march could be the most underappreciated movie of the year in 20 years theyre gonna go back and say oh that was american politics in that time period i follow politics i love it and that movie is so authentic i grew up in politics and i used to work for the democratic party some of the fdas own scientists have charged that politics not science is behind the fdas actions community organizing is all about building grassroots support its about identifying the people around you with whom you can create a common passionate cause and its about ignoring the conventional wisdom of company politics and instead playing the game by very different rules i didnt know my dad  he moved out early and my moms politics were kind of hardscrabble she didnt think about democrats or republicans she thought about who made sense ive been both in my life no one out there is interested in who did what to whom in westminster politics the more that i know of politics the more it makes me realize that being a politician is largely useless in politics people build whole reputations off of getting one thing right first of all i think its odd that people who cover politics wouldnt have any political views i was looking for something like baseball where theres a lot of data and the competition was pretty low thats when i discovered politics i guess i dont like the people in politics very much to be blunt ive had an interest in politics since i was a little kid you dont go into politics unless you want to win i cry sometimes because im not 20 years younger and im not healthy but if i were i would even sacrifice my writing to enter politics i dont want to express my opinion about actual politics because if i do i have to be responsible for my decision i understand the process of politics and the game of television the precise point at which a tax deduction becomes a loophole or a tax incentive becomes a subsidy for special interests is one of the great mysteries of politics politics thrives on simple clean messages something that played to obamas advantage in 2008 stagnant unemployment and the loss of americas aaa rating are as simple and tough as they come this is the economy on obamas watch and theres no one left to blame like indiana jones i dont like snakes  though that might lead some to ask why im in politics a lot of men in politics suddenly woke up to the issue of women in politics when they realised hey there are votes in this i was in the commons recently and saw a young lady wearing a nice pair of shoes i said i liked them and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics its called political economy because it is has nothing to do with either politics or economy as long as i dont write about the government religion politics and other institutions i am free to print anything i think that politics needs a bit of spicing up its much easier to wear a chairman mao button and shake your fists in the air and all that then to actually read the communist manifesto and things like that and actually become involved in politics i deliberately did not read anything about the vietnam war because i felt the politics of the war eclipsed what happened to the veterans the politics were irrelevant to what this memorial was politics is the reflex of the business and industrial world there is no hope even that woman with her right to vote will ever purify politics i still love following and thinking about politics i enjoy recommending important journalism i read or see from other sources if american politics are too dirty for women to take part in theres something wrong with american politics there is too much at stake for us to surrender to the politics of polarization in general people feel more relaxed about participating in politics they arent frightened as they used to be in politics you also have to be cautiously optimistic we tend to think of politics as bad full of dirty tricks negative ads big campaigns but i am here to explore the original meaning of politics which is positive and has to do with balancing competing interests and looking for solutions im in politics im in government so nothing surprises me people go into politics because they want the affirmation and they want the applause if i werent doing the politics i wouldnt be doing my job very few people go into politics to be reviled once you start saying lets talk political my own politics my own aspirations it can become not just distracting in that it takes time but it can become confusing and frustrating and is this now a political agenda or a governmental agenda i didnt run for student council president i dont see myself in any way in elected office i love policy im not particularly fond of politics public life is regarded as the crown of a career and to young men it is the worthiest ambition politics is still the greatest and the most honorable adventure mixing humor and politics is something that works whatever your supposed politics are  left right  if you put it in a human connection most people will rise to the occasion and feel the human pain in a way that they might not if it was presented in a more conceptual way theres a tradition in british intellectual life of mocking any nonpolitical force that gets involved in politics especially within the sphere of the arts and the theatre its a good question because a movie isnt good or bad based on its politics its usually good or bad for other reasons though you might agree or disagree with its politics well you know what im 60 years old and ive been interested in politics since i was on my daddys knee during the 1948 election we were praying for truman i know a lot about politics lets just do what is right for the american people and those of us who are involved in politics and government know that our responsibility is to the american people that we have a responsibility to find our common ground to seek it and to find it if i cry its about the personal loss of a friend or something like that but when it comes to politics  no i dont cry its about time we make the wellbeing of our young people more important than ideology and politics as a country we benefit from investing in their future by investing in teen pregnancy prevention when i started cnn i made the decision to stay out of endorsing candidates and let the doers make up their own minds about politics that it wasnt going to come from me i dont know if anybody wants to mix their politics with their entertainment yes politics is war without bloodshed and war is an extension of those politics the ability of the 1 percent to buy politicians and regulators is nothing new in american politics  just as inequality has been a permanent part of our economic system this is true of virtually all political and economic systems im highly political i spend an awful lot of time in the us trying to influence decisionmakers but i dont feel in tune with british politics the problem of the middle east is poverty more than politics its not about division its not about politics my concern is how do we come together well purity  theres no purity in politics going into politics is something people have asked me about forever well theres nobody who has a more supportive husband than i do and he has a business that he runs and its his own business so he has work to do my kids have school to do i mean people have  there are other things in life besides politics well the role of money in politics is pretty corrupting right now you know rock stardom i have a hard time discussing that because i dont really accept it its not really that tangible whats really bizarre is how its used as a thing  you know hes the rock star of politics hes the rock star of quarterbacks  like its the greatest thing in the world i am a part of the political process whether the multinational forces are present or not politics is serving the people not chairs and positions politics is the art of the next best politics ruins the character politics is the art of the possible today i think the attitude is that governing is not necessarily good politics and the result is that its much more partisan and much more divided there can only be democracy when money is not allowed to be spent in politics but i dont need to use politics as a way of making money when i came into politics i always thought there was a possibility i would be killed if there is one eternal truth of politics it is that there are always a dozen good reasons for doing nothing im not into politics but i am committed to a cause ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the uk curriculum alongside science and maths  grounding abstract theory merging the practical with the academic i could have made a fortune in cheeseburgers but i finally chose politics one of the things thats great about new york is that it is not a oneindustry town it has education academia the service industry arts publishing theater politics fashion finance as well as moviemaking there are three critical ingredients to democratic renewal and progressive change in america good public policy grassroots organizing and electoral politics it is the belief that extremes and excesses of inequality must be reduced so that each person is free to fully develop his or her full potential this is why we take precious time out of our lives and give it to politics politics is not about money politics is not about power politics is not about winning for the sake of winning politics is not predictions and politics is not observations politics is what we do politics is what we do politics is what we create by what we work for by what we hope for and what we dare to imagine we can and must move us politics forward by means of committed participation if you really want to diminish a candidate depict him as the foil of his handler this is as old in american politics as politics itself look there ought to be politics in politics the fallback position in politics is if you dont know what you want to be about and if you dont know what your vision is go at somebody else negative politics have always been around ill never get out of politics i have friends in public office i have things that i want to do you cant go back in life i wont go back to the existence i had before of running a political consulting firm and signing up clients and advising campaigns in exactly that way i know enough about european politics to know youve got a lot of crazy people who make their way onto the ballot one thing i have learned in my time in politics is that if one of the parties is shameless the other party cannot afford to be spineless what is more comforting to the terrorists around the world the failure to pass the 911 legislation because we lacked a majority of the majority or putting aside partisan politics to enact tough new legislation with americas security foremost in mind i dont want to spend the rest of my life in politics when im finished with my term as governor im going back to the life thats waiting for me in the private sector politics is not my life i have a career in radio and another career in film im not a political person when i start to get into it it just upsets me i feel so powerless when it comes to politics so ive just decided to be nonpolitical and very very prosoldier politics is my hobby smut is my vocation in politics the number of women in the cabinet has fallen and if current poll trends continue and labour loses a number of marginal seats the number of female mps is likely to drop significantly the labour party has done more than any other to address gender inequalities through legislation and other means and to increase womens representation in politics which has led to recent increases in the number of female politicians for sure the obamania thats fast taking hold reflects an incredible thirst for change in global politics and dare i say a wave of optimism that things can be different we need to dig deep and give people a reason to be optimistic just as obama is doing in america because in the same way that outcome of the us elections will change the course of events there and around the world so too do politics here in britain being out and about talking to residents and representing their views is in my view as important to politics as the grandstanding that takes place in westminster economics politics and personalities are often inseparable unfortunately the global warming hysteria as i see it is driven by politics more than by science politics is show business for ugly people religion has to stay in the heart not in politics it is private im not going to talk like i know about politics because im a total amateur but maybe i can be a spokesperson for people who arent normally interested in politics but im not interested in politics i lose interest the microsecond it ceases to be emotional when something becomes a political movement what im interested in is emotions politics is a highly tribal business you have a political and media elite who have an idiom by which they describe politics its highly highly polarised its right left red blue up down victorious crushed i didnt become leader to transform the liberal democrats into an enlarged form of the electoral reform society its not the be all and end all for us there are other very very key ambitions in politics not least social mobility and life chances that i care about as passionately if not more i have got instincts that i think are very much in tune with peoples very keen sense to see something different i did not dream of being in politics since i was kneehigh to a grasshopper i was not involved in student politics or not in that partisan way what i hope is in five years time i can go to the british people in the election and say lots of you doubted that coalition politics worked but it has worked the british political system and the whole clapped out westminster architecture and the language that we use about politics its completely unsustainable you either decide to be part of that transition to do something different or you cling to old certainties politics and power is a realm of relative influence i dont get involved in record label politics at the end of the day money is just a proxy for votes that is what makes politics so vulnerable to social media politics makes me sick i do not know much about politics but i am trying to do the best i can with this administration until the time shall come for me to turn it over to somebody else i try not to tune in to politics until its two or three months before the election till then its like watching preseason football i dont feel finally that my politics are entirely determined by the fact that im a gay man artists know that diligence counts as much if not more as inspiration in art as in politics patience counts as much as revolution no matter where i go  london beirut jerusalem washington beijing or bangalore  im always looking to rediscover that land of ten thousand lakes where politics actually worked to make peoples lives better not pull them apart people who build family businesses are not classically trained they have to deal with an enormous amount of politics you think corporate politics are tough go work for your dad or your mom human nature doesnt include all human beings there are human beings who are indifferent to politics religion virtually anything to balance china the democracies will need new friends  and india with its fastgrowing economy youthful population and democratic politics seems the obvious candidate like art and politics gangsterism is a very important avenue of assimilation into society im an independent im a centrist a new generation is arriving that has grown up with a multiplicity of choice in every aspect of their lives and yet politics is the last place that they are told that they should be satisfied with a choice between brand a and brand b it doesnt fit the way they think it doesnt fit the way they live i dont miss politics the idea that religion and politics dont mix was invented by the devil to keep christians from running their own country people not just reporters are more interested in politics than in government so the actual issues wouldnt be something that interested them no one wants to hear my perspective on politics but i think honestly as you get older you get more interested in it would that the simple maxim that honesty is the best policy might be laid to heart that a sense of the true aim of life might elevate the tone of politics and trade till public and private honor become identical my passion for ideas is not matched with a passion for partisan or electoral politics pro football gave me a good sense of perspective to enter politics id already been booed cheered cut sold traded and hung in effigy there are a lot of grotesqueries in politics not the least of which is the fundraising side clinton and obama practice this politics known quaintly as the richard speck strategy if you cannot take on everyone in the room at once take them out of the room one at a time although as a sailor i despised politics  for i loved my sailors life and still love it today  conditions forced me to take up a definite attitude towards political problems please dont ask me any questions about the politics of 30 years ago in politics a capable ruler must be guided by circumstances conjectures and conjunctions its very personal in its politics very bitter and very negative somehow we cant live outside the politics of race theres something very deep in all of us that is taught to us when we are very very little which is the disrespect and fear of the other talk of citizenship today is often thin and tinny the word has a faintly oldfashioned feel to it when used in everyday conversation when evoked in national politics its usually accompanied by the shrill whine of a descending culturewar mortar sometimes when i listen to fellow progressives i wonder if the only lesson we took away from the 04 elections is that politics is a word game in almost every country there are elements of opinion which would welcome such a conclusion because they wish to return to the politics of the balance of power unrestricted and unregulated armaments international anarchy and preparation for war on the contrary the characteristic element of the present situation is that economic questions have finally and irrevocably invaded the domain of public life and politics but i think its quite clear in my work that my orientation isnt political or doesnt come out of modern politics you will find in politics that you are much exposed to the attribution of false motive never complain and never explain and humility in politics means accepting that one party doesnt have all the answers recognising that working in partnership is progress not treachery my college fitzwilliam was pretty good but unfashionable and i lived in digs so i was not part of the cloistered old college environment which frankly was a bit intimidating but i worked hard and settled in by exploring politics and girls i hate injustice and i cant help but speak against it but i dont want to get involved in politics i get asked a lot about getting into politics i say take a look at politics you tell me what seems appealing about that politics has become unbelievably and unfortunately way too much about how much money is involved rather than what kind of ideas are involved arkansas is a state where politics is retail well for me the prolife issue has been something ive been very passionate about since the 70s and i have been very involved in the prolife community since long before politics regardless of bill clintons politics or personal life he grew up in obscurity and was elected to the presidency  twice dont take that away from him because then you take it away from every other kid in america sitting out there in a school bus with a big dream local politics like everything else are not what they used to be but the fact is that our political system  like our physical existence  still breaks down along geographical lines i cant see why anyone would want to be in politics because you get so much criticism politics is a lot of serendipity youre in the right place and the right time and youve got the right message and it either connects for you or or it doesnt im not involved in the politics of religion but i love what the message is anyone who seeks to be involved in politics should join hands with america in the world of energy politics the sudden vanishing of the word coal is a remarkable and unprecedented event bloomberg is famously impatient with beltway politics and believes that to get anything done you need to work from the ground up im not really involved with politics im living in my cocoon with my classical music around on the one hand the financial projection is on the agenda  we will see if this problem can be resolved or not i think it is a right idea to stage a special summit which would deal with the question of priorities of european politics that is why everyone in politics and we do it must make sure that they do not depend on one single interest group a good compromise is one where everybody makes a contribution thus the focus on this main political goal must become more visible in eu politics and to achieve this we need a political impulse it must be clear what the priorities on the agenda are whoever decides to dedicate their life to politics knows that earning money isnt the top priority its such a beautiful sport with no politics involved no color no class only as a youngster can you play and as a pro can you win the game has kept me young involved and excited and for me to be up here with gems of baseball ive never worked in politics never been a member of an official committee or a political party were in an illusion about what our role is in world politics and foreign affairs and our policies are killing and destroying and doing a lot of things that we are not aware of music is what i must do business is what i need to do and politics is what i have to do i was really lucky that i came to puberty at a time when music and politics were completely intertwined of course there are regrets i shall regret always that i found my own authentic voice in politics i was too conservative too conventional too safe too often too defensive too reactive later too often on the back foot the sight of allegedly sophisticated politicians parroting complete tripe trivialises and demeans government and it has to be stopped its played a significant part in public disillusionment with politics and has led to the absurd situation where more people vote for strictly come dancing than voted in the general election yeah exactly you can talk about politics in music you can talk about something else but thats always going to change and love is never going to change i care about politics just like any other citizen im against the war in iraq or any type of war the only thing i have no control over is the politics that goes on within the record company its always been the same but its far tougher now because record companies are run by financial people before they were run by creative people politics is much too serious to be taken too seriously equally there are many aspects of it so laughable as to be lamentable politics is the enemy of the imagination london in the 70s was a pretty catastrophic dump i can tell you we had every kind of industrial trouble we had severe energy problems we were under constant terrorist attack from irish terrorist groups who started a bombing campaign in english cities politics were fantastically polarized between left and right the journey for women no matter what venue it is  politics business film  its its a long journey my politics are of a practical kind  the integrity of the country the supremacy of the federal government an honorable peace or none at all i understand the damage the expenses crisis has done to parliament and the paramount importance of restoring trust in our politics nothing is irreparable in politics in argument truth always prevails finally in politics falsehood always i hate politics i like to write about it but to get involved in it to try and make a lot of ignorant people do what you want them to do waste of time go and write a book its more important and itll last longer there will be no politics no ifs and buts if we see something and feel that work needs to be done we will get people here we can rely on and ensure it is done in the same thorough way as our other projects i dont take a great deal of interest in party politics social politics interests me a great deal more america wants solutions america wants a leader no more tabloid politics growing up politics never trickled down to the areas we come from but people from obamas camp and obama himself reached out to me and asked for my help on the campaign weve sat and had dinner and weve spoken on the phone hes a very sharp guy very charming very cool if you want to know about my politics the only way to do that is to look at my work i have a lot of nice italian winter clothes that make me look like a sophisticated lebanese professor so my friend robert and i go around pretending to be experts in arabic politics it doesnt work in the summer though i dont have the right clothes people feel politics isnt about their lives good politics starts with empathy proceeds to analysis then sets out values and establishes the vision before getting to the nittygritty of policy solutions everything about my politics has been about the future ive committed myself to serve my constituents in south shields and i have committed myself to british politics you have to believe that its through politics that societies can lead social and economic and political change my advice is very simple if you can win a small battle it gives you confidence in the political process to take on bigger battles and so it is very much a bottomup grassroots way of doing politics politicians talk in generalities and lies and i think theyve caused all our grief theyre so awful theyre really funny i hate thinking this because my dad loved politics politics is pop our job as comedians  especially me as a latenight talk show which is a broader audience  is to amplify what we think america is thinking people are fed up with the politics where candidates just rip each other apart and then the voters lose in the end because no one really knows what anybody stands for my philosophy comes from a worldview that looks at the world as one its a holistic view that sees the world as interconnected and interdependent and integrated in so many different ways which informs my politics whenever you discuss politics it is always better to use individual names rather then the term neocon the art of politics consists in knowing precisely when it is necessary to hit an opponent slightly below the belt i came into politics because i wished to change things you cant do that by lying to people you have to educate and persuade and carry them with you  and its often a long haul i loathe and detest all this trivialisation of politics politics is not a healthy lifestyle short of being prime minister there isnt a better job in british politics than running london ive always said that in politics your enemies cant hurt you but your friends will kill you politics is the skilled use of blunt objects beware the politically obsessed they are often bright and interesting but they have something missing in their natures there is a hole an empty place and they use politics to fill it up it leaves them somehow misshapen i became active in politics because i saw the possibility if we all sat back and did nothing of a world in which there would no longer be any stages for actors to act on i hate politics hate deals and dealmaking hate meeting with attorneys and agents the essential ingredient of politics is timing in my early 20s i studied history and politics and i really thought that perhaps i would devote my life to that im not involved in politics any more and theyre quite right im not taking any interest in politics im not involved in politics in any way my life is in writing now politics should share one purpose with religion the steady emancipation of the individual through the education of his passions i am interested in politics the movies were custard compared to politics the conversion of agnostic high tories to the anglican church is always rather suspect it seems too pat and predictable too clearly a matter of politics rather than faith political correctness in my humor i never talk about politics i was never much into all that theres a nastiness out there that wants to harm me with words these are my enemies  the ideologues the populists the columnists who dont like the fact that i take them on toetotoe what i try to do is tell the truth its not the coin of the realm in politics the tax issue is the most powerful issue in american politics going back to the tea party people say oh grover norquist has power no grover norquist and americans for tax reform focus on the tax issue the tax issue is a powerful issue look the center right coalition in american politics today is best understood as a coalition of groups and individuals that on the issue that brings them to politics what they want from the government is to be left alone in my case i was covering politics in texas as a newspaper man in the 1960s value your freedom or you will lose it teaches history dont bother us with politics respond those who dont want to learn men enter local politics solely as a result of being unhappily married american politics used to be an amateur sport but somewhere along the way we handed over to professionals all the things people used to do for free does politics have to be injected into everything gossip is easy politics is hard this is not the time for partisan bickering this is not the time for politics as usual some of us are democrats some of us are republicans some of us are independents above all we must be oklahomans first broadcasters or politicians or writers who think that they are respecting struggle street the battlers by dumbing things down into oneline sound bites are not respecting them they are treating them with contempt its our job above all in politics to tackle the big issues and to explain them the proliferation of outlets that digital technology has enabled has itself contributed to the changing nature of what we regard as news and the way in which many citizens perceive politics it is our job above all in politics to tackle the big issues and to explain them and have the honesty to say to people there are no easy solutions here the only reason to be in politics is public service theres no other reason frankly if thats the best job you can get in terms of money thats too bad you know because frankly its not well paid everyone knows that so for most people its a big sacrifice i will go to the next election saying to australians vote for me vote for the liberal party and i will become your pm so im offering myself as the alternative pm  thats one way people describe the leader of the opposition  but im not in politics for myself to realize a personal ambition i dont want to force my politics on my readers i could pose in fashion commercials as a high society star but politics is a new way of life whats going on in the senate is kind of a politics of escalation were getting sort of like the mideast pay back everybody when youre in charge the politics of judges is getting to be red hot look how many millions of people are underemployed or have lost their jobs the last thing im going to do is play politics with their future president obama chose politics over leadership hope and change have become baitandswitch i dont for the life of me understand how anybody could contemplate the results of the 2000 election in the us and say that electoral politics doesnt matter any more and that ralph nader was right when he said there is no difference between the two parties i first came to think about media and politics in the late 1960s having observed some distortions up close but since then i wouldnt say that my personal experience has remained an important motive for my writing about media my position is not that john kerry is either jesus christ or the prophet mohammad my position is that john kerry is the possibility of restarting politics right now we have no possibility of politics because we have a oneparty state well australias been in afghanistan from the get go way back in 2001 but we have been resolute throughout and with support from both sides of australian politics look at the declining television coverage look at the declining voting rate economics and economic news is what moves the country now not politics beyond politics the west is suffering from what can be called a crisis of brokenness  broken institutions broken families and broken souls newt gingrich is one of the brightest people in the republican party and hes always been a little unorthodox in his approach to politics but thats what makes him newt gingrich a week is a long time in politics no i probably do better not being in politics they have too much control over you when you are in politics theres not a single chef i know of that does not think about the politics of the food theyre serving my publicist told me not to talk about politics but yes i think we have a president who stole the election you should never ask actors about politics theres a couple things you dont talk about in life and thats race religion and politics i try to make sure i dont talk about politics at all good thing weve still got politics in texas  finest form of free entertainment ever invented i never saw anything funnier than texas politics the tucs new slogan a future that works sets a profound challenge austerity and rapid deficit reduction is failing in its own terms but even at its best it is shortsighted muddlethrough politics with no vision of a new economic model politics is very interesting and always leads to conflict i am not at all a politician i dont think im cut out for politics i am certainly not going to stand for election i met my wife anne who was a sociology student and her influence together with activities associated with the student movement of the time opened up my interests amongst other things into the theatre art music politics and philosophy im not very active politically the causes i work on offer immediate practical accessible help and politics has never meant that to me is anyone serious about the politics of happiness david cameron dipped a toe in the water using the word lightly but denying the hard policies it implies labour shies away from it but should take up the challenge my job is to look at what politics is doing not be a politician myself all tools have intrinsic politics and technology is the tool of now when we talk about safety and security of the american people politics falls aside pretty quickly liberalism is rationalism in politics its true that its within the realm of cultural politics that young people tend to work through political issues which i think is good although its not going to solve the problems i have always hated celebrities lecturing people on politics so forgive me but i am passionate about this country i am equally passionate about the potential of the people who live here difference of religion breeds more quarrels than difference of politics things happen in american politics in the political center if the president will meet us in the center there are things we can accomplish politics is the science of urgencies i look for the humanity in people however big the politics or oppressive the situation may be whether its subsumed within a human being or between two human beings i want to help us hold a mirror to ourselves theres a rule of thumb in politics if youre at a point where youre complaining about the other guy being mean and unfair and uncivil thats probably a sign that youre losing i know my limitations and i dont like politics i was only involved because of my husband it seems to be the thing now that young people are getting back into politics i think especially in a world where you have so little say about what goes on in your life or in the politics of the world around you it is wonderful to go into that studio and tell yourself what to do theres people coming in whove never done any politics at all whove never been in a trade union theyve never been in a political party theyve never done anything but they do feel a kind of urgency i think ralph nader is the biggest liar in american politics when he said it didnt matter who was president i think one of the most threatening places to be in politics is a black conservative because there are so many liberals who want to continue to reinforce a stereotype that doesnt exist about america the one thing we can all be sure about in politics is you are as well to expect the unexpected i am genuinely not an overthetop kind of person about politics or anything else yes you need substance in politics  but i think your style also says something about how you arrive at some of your conclusions music and politics are in essence about communication without overstretching the analogy i do feel a sense of rhythm is important in getting your message across the larger meaning here is that mainstream journalists simply cannot talk about things that the two parties agree on this is the black hole of american politics until politics are a branch of science we shall do well to regard political and social reforms as experiments rather than shortcuts to the millennium rush limbaugh we expect nonsense from him but the vatican thats another story when the vatican is so threatened that it launches attacks on nuns well you know what they say in politics a hit dog hollers in so much of politics youre not allowed to disagree with whats been agreed im not deeply ideologically driven i believe in good centerright politics i always had a longterm view of going into politics so i suppose i was always careful i mean i got offered all these rinky dink tax deals but i always paid my taxes i am naturally quite conservative i was really fascinated by politics it always has been part of my view that politics really is a calling or you wouldnt go into it because its demanding and potentially has a toll on you and your family politics is gut commercials are gut the challenge in working in politics particularly if youre working for a political party is that everyones a messenger what matters most in politics is personality its not issues its not image its who you are and what you represent ive done reasonably well over the last 10 years because i took the strategy of language and politics and applied it to the corporate world which has never been done before macroeconomic policy can never be devoid of politics it involves fundamental tradeoffs and affects different groups differently hope springs eternal even in politics when you look at our world the truth is that were all under the influence of politics even if we dont know it or arent aware of it politics and philosophy are really what make our up lives politics makes strange bedfellows im interested in current affairs and social policy as a whole but i dont watch politics for sport on the show we are not trying to get people to eat their vegetables we are not trying to get people to become democrats we are basically trying to encourage people to get involved with public life so that politics isnt left to the wealthy and privileged im no expert on american politics robert kennedy was such an inspiring figure his interest in politics seemed to come not from a desire for power but from a need to help our society live up to its ideals in washington dc politics dominate even the most casual conversations in politics it seems retreat is honorable if dictated by military considerations and shameful if even suggested for ethical reasons if we tried to write about politics youd realize that were all a bunch of idiots i ask you turn a deaf ear to the special interests let politics stand down for a while dont waste anytime thinking about future elections until weve done our jobs here my political science degree is always on the backburner i took my lsat so even if i want to take the lsat again i know what im getting into ill keep it on the backburner who knows maybe with my popularity i can have a career in politics with a law degree i think itll work out either way every week i read about myself in a magazine about something that i havent done or some place that ive never been or dont even know its just gossip rumors egos and politics i was in the room with you know more than a dozen republicans trying to negotiate the stimulus most of them decided the politics of the situation meant they should walk away even if it wasnt responsible in terms of what our country needed right then music shouldnt be based around money or politics music should be a bunch of people that really do great songs together doing them together for the pursuit of having a good time inauthenticity is endemic in american politics today the political backrooms where i spent much of my career were just as benighted as my personal life equally crowded with shadowy strangers and compromises truths i hoped to deny i lived not in one closet but in many you never know whatll happen in politics i kept a steel wall around my moral and sexual instincts  protecting them i thought from the threats of the real world this gave me a tremendous advantage in politics if not in my soul the true me my spiritual core slipped further and further from reach but being in the closet uniquely assisted me in politics from my first run for the state legislature until my election as governor all too often i was not leading but following my best guess at public opinion my mom is like this hardcore liberal feminist shes a professor in boston and shes been teaching womens studies for 30 years and international politics i think the rules are going to have to change for me to ever run for public office my checkered past will always keep me out of politics im not entirely sure what my end goal is but id love to get involved in city politics and broadcast tv you know i started my career in politics in 1967 im not new to this i did not just fall off the christmas tree i understand the world is complex i know that there are people out there who want to hurt other people when you come from desperate poverty and thats exactly what i come from you know that nonsenses are not to be tolerated im not sure who gains from chaos but i know its not the poor folks in the council flats the politics of vindictiveness is never ever anything like a solution let me tell you sisters seeing dried egg on a plate in the morning is a lot dirtier than anything ive had to deal with in politics i just feel like im a very lucky person to have a new life outside of politics since the governments are in the pockets of businesses whos going to control this most powerful institution business is more powerful than politics and its more powerful than religion so its going to have to be the vigilante consumer divorced from ethics leadership is reduced to management and politics to mere technique the gays like project runway because its a fashion and the gays are into fashion and into design its a creative industry and most of the gays are pretty creative in general thats just like the culture were not all into politics necessarily were more into the creative environment i also think heidi is a big draw the boys love heidi and think shes so fabulous i just think its a glitzy fun show and there are also always lots of gay boys on it and you know thats fun i would say that no film is apolitical there are politics in all films any film that is anchored in a society any film that deals with humanity is necessarily political i was very aware of office politics because i was so baffled by them so much so goes unsaid no one says youre a cheeky soandso no one says youre so moody nobody ever confronts anyone else about anything but im very crass and im very confrontational and i have a temper i had to be hypervigilant in every office i worked in i always wanted to work at take a break magazine you know just to inject a little bit of politics into their stories i applied for a job there after id done my law degree and didnt even get an interview i only wrote garnethill because i didnt get that job be your own politics grow your own garden and maybe you can help out more we would not have our politics distracted and embittered by the dissensions of other lands acting is fun and i refuse to get involved in the semantics and the politics of strategy and breaking out of something or doing something because you need to do something else for me its all about what fuels my soul and if im passionate about a screenplay then thats what ill do next politics is politics art is art if you play a political role you have to stop being an artist we can play politics or we can reduce crime in politics sometimes you have to lie or you make a promise that you cannot keep politics isnt about left versus right its about top versus bottom i was supposed to be womens lib and now id exceeded it and gone over into international politics in politics there are no friends we are naive and moralistic women we are human beings who find politics a blight upon the human condition and do not know how one copes with it except through politics abortion politics have distracted all sides from what is really essential a major aid campaign to improve midwifery prenatal care and emergency obstetric services in poor countries imagine a civilisation thats way in advance of us wants to communicate with us and assist us in our development the information we provide to them must reflect our highest aspirations and ideals and not just be some crazy persons bizarre politics or religion i never let my politics supersede my manners politics like theater is one of those things where youve got to be wise enough to know when to leave lenin said that people vote with their feet well thats whats happening they either go or they dont go its all politics its all demographics i wanted the feel in these books to be like an epic fantasy with kings queens dukes and court politics but of course like what i was explaining before about making the science make sense you have to make the politics make sense too if one of my boys was asking me if they should go into politics id say theres only one reason to go into public life and thats to help people my first meeting as a senator my first day they were already talking about the next election part of thats the permanent campaign part of thats a word ive been using more frequently tribal our politics has become tribal its us versus them im pleased to offer analysis of public policy and politics to the millions of americans who get their news from fox well a lot of politics is communicating with people and obviously comedy has something to do with that ive been a producer and led people also being a comedian youre under pressure i think to be in politics you have to have the taste for blood on that the next thing i am doing is moving back home to minnesota and getting involved in politics im looking at a run for senate in 2008 but in the meantime i am focused on knitting together the progressive network in the upper midwest the sheeppeople dont think for themselves anymore you can say anything and its the gospel truth and they dont have to go research it or anything and they believe everything the news tells them people dont go and do their own investigations if its relationships or politics or anything the legions of reporters who cover politics dont want to quit the clash and thunder of electoral combat for the dry duty of analyzing the federal budget as a consequence we have created the perpetual presidential campaign politics aside it will be hard for any new liberal radio network to outdo the professionalism of npr it is important to recognize and politics positive thinking is often the slaves virtue  something that people do to con themselves about the burden and change being placed upon them as a politician who cherishes religious conviction in his personal sphere but regards politics as a domain belonging outside religion i believe that this view is seriously flawed every artistic expression is either influenced by or adds something to politics i was raised to speak out about politics and the world around me i would do it whether i was in the public or not it is the way i was taught the american way all politics is local i think that what im doing is right and electionyear politics which intensifies everything is not going to drive me off that course by asking the question am i happy and via the answer setting out what i mean by happiness there is a political route that can be taken by asking another question  can politics deliver happiness and should it try so here is one of my theories on happiness we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end this view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of philip gould philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics when he died i felt like i had lost a limb there has been a shift to what may be defined as a culture of negativity which goes well beyond coverage of politics ive done business with people ive met in politics who i went to law school with who i grew up with who do you do business with people you meet in life as ive gotten older ive gotten more liberal and my father is increasingly conservative its so shocking to me because i always thought we had the same politics the day i realized we voted for different presidents i practically fell out of my chair you help me ill help you thats politics as a society i think we express our cultural mores through our politics were trying constantly to figure out whats ok and whats not ok and its hard because our society is constantly buffeted by gale force winds of technology things are always changing people like to do politics with me and they like to do business we talked about politics constantly in my family growing up in north carolina there were always debates being of greek background its in our blood to drink coffee and talk politics anyone in politics would like to have great economic numbers whether you are on the right or the left everyone can agree that there are a lot of outside influences in american politics that are not good for the system theres just too much money about 25 years ago i started out as a reporter covering politics and that sort of just evolved into organized crime because organized crime and politics were the same thing in boston but look you did not have to be well versed in politics to know that some stupid things were going on it is the counsels job to stop them and instead the coverup was created im not really one of those people who believes that if youre a musician you can just leave that behind and start getting into politics a purely objective viewpoint does not exist in the cosmos or in politics when youre young with less on the line its easier to be audacious to experiment so i introduced the concerns of my generation  politics sex drugs rockandroll etc  to the comics page which for many years caused a rolling furor in my rightwing politics of the time i held that unemployment was usually the fault of the unemployed i did not resign from politics because of bofors i resigned because i do not know how to play petty politics i did not know back then and i dont know now either broadway is such a diverse community everybody knows how i believe and everyone believes and its not a big deal but in hollywood if you talk about politics  especially if youre a republican  or spirituality its just not something people want to hear about i just worry a lot im a worrier michelle and barack are really dear to me i mean i love them and i dont want to see them get hurt just the nature of politics is hurtful so every time they are hurt i get hurt its a lot to ask of people and its a lot to see your friends go through its hard not to get emotional i was totally absorbed in the real world the politics the history the news and i just couldnt find my way into the fictional world when i finally could return to writing the novel it was in fits and starts i dont want to be a politician i dont like politics its petty it fights dirty i like politics i like traveling in the united states politics is a people business i like people i mean the part you dont like i mean thats the only part thats the part no one likes and that is the criticisms and the unfair criticisms i might add of my husband but thats also just a fact of life in politics the argument of the broken window pane is the most valuable argument in modern politics so my degree was in political science which i think was  the closest i could come to marketing is politics american influence in the world is certainly considerable but the united states does not control directly or indirectly the politics and economics of other societies as empires have always done save for a few special cases that turn out to be the exceptions that prove the rule we dont tend to write about disease in fiction  not just teen novels but all american novels  because it doesnt fit in with our idea of the heroic romantic epic there is room only for sacrifice heroism war politics and family struggle the thing about american politics as ive learned is there is no choice conscience has no more to do with gallantry than it has with politics on the other side i do believe that the rhetoric we are seeing from the democrats today is unprecedented is a new low in presidential politics and goes beyond political discourse and amounts to political hate speech i mean that i think i find the psychology of people more interesting than politics i think the psychology of politics is more interesting than straight politics people like passion in politics politics swings like a pendulum i think karl rove saw that in george w bush early on and understood the impact that he could have on texas politics and probably on national politics my mothers studies stopped with the third year of primary school my father with the first they taught me a deep sense of duty but nobody was involved in politics in my family i was on leave from local and regional politics as long as i was a minister in politics the choice is constantly between two evils politics is a field where the choice lies constantly between two blunders money has too big an influence on our politics in washington and somehow we need to do something about that there was a widespread indignation in the american media they were saying how can you make a movie during an election thats about politics what are you doing are you trying to influence peoples lives to which my response was well i hope so in politics madame you need two things friends but above all an enemy truth is i dont think god on a daily basis i think politics science every person has only so much attention to give and politics and government takes up only a fraction of what it did 25 years ago for us sons of france political sentiment is a passion while for the englishmen politics are a question of business chicago is known for good steaks expensive stores and beautiful architecture unfortunately the windy city also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics violent crime and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country it is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear living in washington you cant take politics too seriously i draw the line at honesty i have no time for political hacks who say things they dont believe because they get paid to well i think any time you delve into this sort of religion politics as you well know youre going to you know touch a few nerves i wasnt  now  and this is the honest truth i think he was absolutely right not to go to un last week first things first  that is values and people here in their local communities and remembering all politics is local and trusting people more we must remember that politics is more than a power game the core of politics in my view is to serve our citizens to serve our fellow human beings i am involved with politics today because of the inspiration i received from ronald reagan as i became very defined in my personal politics i turned down some films that i slightly regret now im not going to say what they were were seeing quite a lot of people who really would like a return to classbased politics i dont find music being less important than like politics in ancient greece politics and the market were not decoupled money in politics is a huge issue i have always said i will be in politics to serve as best as i can and it will take me wherever it will take me yes is a far more potent word than no in american politics by adopting the positions which animate the political agenda for the other side one can disarm them and leave them sputtering with nothing to say i believe in incentivizing people if you can incentivize people in anything whether its in politics in life in spirituality in business just take care of folks incentivize them and all of a sudden its amazing the difference that youll see if greece had gone through a very normal political life i may have not been in politics but just the fact that i lived through huge upheavals and very difficult struggles and polarization and the barbarism of dictatorships  that made me feel that we had to change this country people meet in bars after work all over the world and talk about the great problems of life and death and the world and politics and they dont take themselves seriously they can do nothing else except chat about these things in bars after work spontaneous combustion of grassroots politics is the future there is this concept of politics as a dirty game its a difficult game but it doesnt have to be dirty i think this is what we need to bring to politics i think politics around the world has very often been captured by big interests  lobbies they call them in the states this idea that a book can either be about character and feeling or about politics and idea is just a false binary ideas are an expression of the feelings and the intense emotions we hold about the world most people get their politics obviously from tv shows about senators or movies about them or all the daytoday press and the talk shows i call it peopletopeople politics and thats what politics should be about reaching out and helping one another and touching one another about what were going to do politics was my third act but i could have a fourth i dont know what that will be yet but there will be one first take the government of the indians out of politics second let the laws of the indians be the same as those of the whites third give the indian the ballot we mistake politics for legislative debate you can be passionate without being personal the difference between the men and the boys in politics is and always has been that the boys want to be something while the men want to do something on the mountains mistakes are fatal in politics mistakes are wounding emotionally but you recover personally wilderness helps me get back in touch with natural rhythms helps me reflect and in the process restore my creativity the only politics in this country thats relevant to black people today is the politics of revolution none other
