You are not just limited to text first of all. You may want to feed in MIDI data to create a piece of algorithmic music. I've tried it with raw sound data and this even works, but it requires a lot of memory and at least 30k iterations to run before it sounds like anything. Or perhaps you might try some other unexpected text based information, such as encodings of image data like JPEG in base64. Or other compressed data formats.

From here, you are only limited by the time it takes to train all of the interesting ideas you'll have. But there is still so much more to discover, and it's very likely that this entire course is already out of date, because this field just moves incredibly fast. In any case, the applications of these techniques are still fairly stagnant, so if you're here to see how your creative practice could grow with these techniques, then you should already have plenty to discover.\n",

    "I'm very excited about how the field is moving. Often, it is very hard to find labels for a lot of data in a meaningful and consistent way. But there is a lot of interesting stuff starting to emerge in the unsupervised models. Those are the models that just take data in, and the computer reasons about it. And even more interesting is the combination of general purpose learning algorithms. That's really where reinforcement learning is starting to shine. But that's for another course, perhaps."
